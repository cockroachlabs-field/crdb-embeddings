Listen. Was in town from LA and the first recommendation was Terry Black's Barbecue. Having roots in-state I knew the standard was gonna be high but what I di'nt know was that this 'cue was going to alter my version of food reality. Arriving at 645p to the longest line I've ever witnessed for a restaurant, my first grown-man instinct was to tell the Uber driver "keep going cuz I don't do lines." To which she replied" You do today. Enjoyeeee" and kicked me out her car. Hesitantly getting in line I quickly discovered how fast it moved and how perfectly spaced out their beer stations were so that by the time I slugged that first can, I was at the second one ready for a refill. Brilliant! Next stop was the "with your meal" beer trough where I picked my favorite Shiner Bock then started with my sides. Green Beans, Mac-n-Cheese (even though I'm lactose intolerant), Rice, Beans, Peach Cobbler, Potato salad and cornbread. Next was the meat station and upon seeing the perfectly cooked slabs of gloriousness I began to weep. "Brisket, sausage and one beef rib please." As I dried my face. The cashier gave me my total: $95. LA prices. I wept again. I sampled single-solo bites of each dish working my way towards that rib and threw in the towel on the potato salad. I looked at the lady next to me and said "This ish is ridiculous. If I die before I'm done, tell my mama I said: Step yo game up!" You know how hard it is to outdo my mamas???
