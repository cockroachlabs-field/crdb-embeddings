St. Bernardus Abt 12 is an award winning quadrupel that pours a hazy brown with a frothy beige head and expressive carbonation.

Top fermented, bottle conditioned and matured for three months, the brew boasts aromas of dried fruits, plums and raisins, coffee, cherry, bread and caramel.

Taste follows the nose and includes candy sugar sweetness balanced by spice, coriander, a big hit of malt, fruit, and the warming power of 10.0% ABV.

The mouthfeel is soft, smooth and medium bodied. The finish is dry, warm and slightly bitter.

Food Pairings

This beer is a perfect ingredient in and accompaniment to classic Belgian stews, such as rabbit and prune casserole or beef carbonnade.

Blue cheeses of the Roquefort type also make for an ideal pairing, and don't overlook chocolate desserts for an unexpected but very successful combination.

Serve at 46 - 57 degrees F.
