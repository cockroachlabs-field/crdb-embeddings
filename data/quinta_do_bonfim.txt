You must definitely take the drive up the hill to visit this Quinta! We took a taxi (10€) from the train station, and it was 100% worth it! My family and I had such a wonderful time, and we would’ve stayed longer if we didn’t have to catch the train back to Porto. The wine and port were delicious, the views were amazing, and the hospitality was second to none! Antonio is a fifth generation member of the family, and was a super gracious host to us. It was olive harvesting time, and he took us on a walk to see how they harvest the olives. All is done by hand, and he even let us have a try at knocking olives off the tree! The family also has some bee hives so they harvest their own honey. We didn’t get to do a tour since we had to catch the train, but we tasted their reds, whites, port, olive oil, and honey. Such a fun morning for my family! We will definitely return every time we are in Pinhão!
