Not since Team Edward and Team Jacob have Washingtonians been forced to choose sides like this. We have dueling Stephen Starr productions designed to transport you to the Parisian culinary setting of your dreams — the quintessential bistro (Pastis) and the quintessential brasserie (Le Dip). So which is better? My wishy-washy take is they’re roughly equal and you should go with what kind of “crowded” you’re looking for — the cozy kind (Pastis) or the bustling kind (Le Dip). The more nuanced answer is it depends what you’re in the mood for. If you ‘re a bread-head, it’s advantage Le Dip for its bountiful basket over Pastis’ sliced sourdough. If you care about frites, it’s Le Dip again for its thinner/crisper fries, although the Pastis fries are nicely salted. As for the steak accompanying those frites, I like Pastis’ succulent bar cut better than Le Dip’s hanger steak that can be perfect one visit and gamey the next. Both do excellent green salads but the leeks vinaigrette at Pastis gives it the edge from the garden (I do like the Warm Shrimp Salad at Le Dip but that’s more of a light meal than a starter). For dessert, Pastis’ textbook creme caramel gets the nod over Le Dip’s been-there-done-that creme brûlée. I know some people swear by the profiteroles at both spots, but I’m not a fan of pate a choux, the same dough that’s used for other unfortunate concoctions like creme puffs. So you’re on your own there.
