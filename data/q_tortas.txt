Love Q-Tortas I grew up in Placentia, so I have been getting breakfast burritos there (and other food of course but the breakfast burritos are good) since I was a kid. If you are ever in the area you should try them. Prices are reasonable. The salsa is good. Chicken tacos are really good too.... Make it a great day people
