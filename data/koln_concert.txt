This live recording of piano improvisations was, as with its 1973 predecessor Solo Concerts: Bremen/Lausanne, the emergence of a new paradigm in jazz performance. These spontaneous compositions showcase Keith Jarrett’s “unstoppable flow” of revolutionary and lyrical ideas, highlighting the deep intimacy that a man alone at the piano can transmit. At the height of the electrified jazz rock and fusion exploration of the 70s, Jarrett’s solo performances tapped into something akin to a spiritual awakening for many a music fan around the globe.
