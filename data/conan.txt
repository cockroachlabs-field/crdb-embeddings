Conan O’Brien has been having conversations professionally for most of his career. On his late-night shows, stars came on to promote their latest film projects, and he brought enough warmth and humor and weirdness to their repartee that viewers didn’t mind that they were being advertised to. His podcast feels much more intimate. I don’t delude myself that the sweet, affectionate chat Conan had with Woody Harrelson and Ted Danson on “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend” is identical to the one they’d have if they weren’t creating entertainment for public consumption. But somewhere outside Hartford, I found myself so thoroughly entertained I stopped doing that thing where you keep pushing the speed limit a little more, hoping you’ll be able to knock a few minutes off your E.T.A. I didn’t care how long I had to go; I just wanted to keep listening and laughing along.
