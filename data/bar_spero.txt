Bar Spero, 250 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington DC (Capitol Crossing, between Union Station and Chinatown)

Bon Appetit named Bar Spero one of the country’s best new restaurants of 2023 and you won’t get any pushback from me (although BA lost me when it described Bar Spero as an “ode to Basque nightlife”). What I am sure of is that there are a lot of good things coming out of the kitchen, often seafood- and veggie-forward and cooked over an open fire. I’ve only been once but everything was a hit — the hearth-grilled bread from Manifest Bakery (with the chicken liver mousse), grilled oysters, beef tartare, the burger (which Spero originally made famous at Reverie), baked potato with smoked egg, Jonah Crab Rice, Beef Rib, and Burnt Cheesecake ice cream. If this is what I’m missing late at night in Basque Country, I may have to book a trip to San Sebastian and stay up past my bedtime.
