Fernwood 2 Night was ironic in tone and set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio, like Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, in which Mull portrayed Barth's twin brother Garth Gimble, who was impaled on an aluminum christmas tree. Fernwood 2 Night parodied actual late-night talk shows and the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced small-town midwestern American television programming. Fernwood 2 Night was the first television talk show satire, foreshadowing the likes of The Larry Sanders Show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, and Comedy Bang! Bang!.[4]

After one summer season of Fernwood 2 Night, the program was revamped in the spring of 1978 as America 2 Night. In this second version, Barth, Jerry and Happy relocated to Southern California (specifically, the fictional city of Alta Coma, "the unfinished furniture capital of the world!") and broadcast the show nationally over the fictional UBS Network. The change to a Southern California setting made it more plausible for real-life celebrities to appear on the program as themselves.[5]

In 2001, Mull and Willard reprised their roles in a stage appearance and retrospective at the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado.[6] The pair also worked together in other projects, appearing together as a gay couple in the final seasons of Roseanne.
