Apache Pinot is a realtime distributed OLAP datastore, which is used to deliver scalable real time analytics with low latency. It can ingest data from batch data sources (such as HDFS, S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage) as well as streaming sources (such as Kafka). Pinot is designed to scale horizontally, so that it can scale to larger data sets and higher query rates as needed.

Pinot is designed to answer OLAP queries with low latency. It is suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion.

Pinot is not a replacement for your database, nor a search engine. It addresses fast analytics on immutable data and it is not thought by design, to handle data updates or deletions. Apache Pinot supports dimension lookup joins currently. Full SQL join support in Apache Pinot is coming soon. In the interim, full SQL joins can be performed by querying Pinot via the Trino or PrestoDB connector.
