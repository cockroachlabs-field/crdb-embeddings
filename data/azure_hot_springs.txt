Recently purchased and overhauled, Azure Palm Hot Springs Resort & Day Spa Oasis is home to a supersize outdoor mineral pool (86-90 degrees), in-suite soaking tubs (106 degrees but adjustable with a cold faucet), a Himalayan salt room and various saunas. Even so, the new Oasis — a sprawling wellness garden — is probably the hardest part to leave. Forming its own informal circuit, it contains a spring-fed, pebble-bottomed reflexology walk; a self-filling warm bucket shower; and a series of 100- to 104-degree soaking tubs, each sufficiently cloistered that hummingbirds may be your only interlopers.

This summer, the resort plans to introduce Midnight at the Oasis events, in which overnight guests will get late-night access to the pools. Later this year, there will also be private cabana tubs — bookable for the day with accompanying fire pits and hammocks. The indoor spa has one of the most extensive menus in the area — the 60-minute Foot and Scalp Ritual ($145) being the ultimate top-off to the reflexology walks and bucket showers. Day passes, which include access to the resort pool, indoor-outdoor spas, sauna, cafe and yoga studio, from $56. Rooms from $169.
