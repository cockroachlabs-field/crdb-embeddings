One of the most influential pianists in modern jazz, McCoy Tyner’s prolific career as both leader and sideman has produced some of the most indispensable recordings in jazz, largely due to his tenure with John Coltrane. Known for his characteristic “quartal” voicings (chords built on intervals of fourths), powerful left hand and percussive phrasing, Tyner assembled a powerhouse quartet for this Blue Note release (his first for the label) with tenor sax great Joe Henderson, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Elvin Jones. A must-have for McCoy fans!
