While Greater Palm Springs has long been known as a center of self-care, the scene is quickly going next-level. For starters, the new Spa at Séc-he represents the first time in years that visitors can actually soak in the waters for which Palm Springs is named: the Agua Caliente Hot Mineral Spring, a sacred site that had closed when its tribal owners and stewards decided to reimagine its full potential almost a decade ago. Now, in addition to the 73,000-square-foot new spa with 22 private spring-fed mineral baths (among many other offerings), the Agua Caliente Cultural Plaza includes a tribal museum and outdoor Oasis Trail. This complex alone is easily a full-day’s immersion. 

Meanwhile, in nearby Desert Hot Springs, the thermal soaking scene is heating up, too: The longtime icon and celebrity hideaway Two Bunch Palms has added new luxury lodgings – complete with their own hot spring-fed tubs – to an already impressive array of accommodations and soaking ops. But even relative newcomers to the Desert Hot Springs wellness scene such as The Good House and Azure Palm Hot Springs Resort & Day Spa Oasis are expanding their spa and spring-fed soaking offerings. Both also offer delicious, healthy specialties at their respective restaurants, where you can eat whether you’re an overnight guest or not. The former has a cozy, fireplace-warmed café where you shouldn’t miss the signature salads and fresh-pressed juices, while the latter has an alfresco communal dining table where specialties like shakshuka tide you over between sessions in the garden’s thermal pools.
