St. Anselm, 1250 5th Street NE, Washington DC (Union Market)

St. Anselm is my favorite steakhouse in DC and the closest thing we have to a sure thing. No one doesn’t enjoy eating there. The menu is full of crowd-pleasers like the iconic biscuits with pimento cheese, blue-crab deviled eggs, salads that don’t try to reinvent the wheel, the sleeper salmon collar, and properly-cooked steaks ranging from the butcher’s cut to the ax-handle ribeye. It feels like a fresh, bumped-up take on what’s comforting and familiar without losing what made them comforting and familiar in the first place. See Caruso’s Grocery, below, for another successful example of updating the classics.
