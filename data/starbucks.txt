You’re already in line at Starbucks — having failed to order by app — when you spot one of them. That dude who is looking down not at a cellphone but at the Post-it note that holds the orders of his office mates. Which is confirming that you are going to be late for that next meeting, because this person plans to order six coffee beverages, each of which involves some combination of tall venti grande double-pump, one to four shots of espresso, half-caf, oat milk, nonfat milk, soy milk, milk milk, whipped cream, syrup, brown sugar, white sugar, no sugar and mocha drizzle, from the pike position with two and a half twists.

If the degree of difficulty in a typical Starbucks order now seems to be Olympian, so are its troubles. The Seattle-based company has become the Boeing of coffee bars. So much so that, like the airframe maker, Starbucks has jettisoned its chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, and replaced him with Brian Niccol, who until recently was the C.E.O. of the Chipotle Tex-Mexish food chain. Although Mr. Niccol’s appointment drove up Starbucks’s stock price, the two companies sometimes have the same problem: too many choices and not enough staff, which at peak times is almost certain to deliver disappointment as much as it does burritos or lattes.
