This Superformance GT40 is a left-hand-drive MkI example that was built in 2023
and purchased by the seller that year. The car features fiberglass bodywork
finished in a light blue and orange Gulf-style livery with painted white #6
roundels in tribute to Ford GT40 P/1075, which was driven to victory at the
1968 and 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans. Power comes from a 351ci V8 equipped with a
Holley Terminator electronic fuel injection system and polished Borla
eight-stack throttle bodies, and it is paired with a Quaife five-speed manual
transaxle. Additional features include adjustable coilovers, Wilwood disc
brakes, 15″ staggered-width wheels, fog lights, a Gurney roof bubble and rear
flap, plexiglass side windows, side scoops, air conditioning, fixed-back seats
with Willans harnesses, Smiths gauges, and a Moto-Lita steering wheel on a
quick-release hub. This Superformance GT40 is now offered in Rock Falls,
Wisconsin, with a Superformance Certificate of Authenticity and order sheet,
build documents, spare parts, literature, and a clean Montana title in the name
of the seller’s LLC listing the car as a 1969 Superformance GT40.
