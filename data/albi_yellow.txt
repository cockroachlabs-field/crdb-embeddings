Albi/Yellow, Albi 1346 4th Street SE, Washington DC (Navy Yard); Yellow 1524 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington DC (Georgetown)

Chef Michael Rafidi is another local treasure who hit his stride by channeling his roots. Rafidi grew up in Maryland but the cooking at the upscale Albi and the more casual Yellow is inspired by his family in Ramallah and what his grandparents cooked at home. Albi showcases a wood-fired open hearth, which not only imbues many of the dishes with smoke and char but elevates the whole vibe of the place. Like Maydan — and to a lesser extent The Dabney and Centrolina — Albi’s open fire creates a primal feeling of safety and community in gathering around a fire to eat. Yellow is a great spot for breakfast or lunch (check it out in the DC episode of Somebody Feed Phil on Netflix). Both spots have excellent hummus, baba ganoush, and felafel to fill out your order. And don’t miss Yellow’s Batata Tots (stacked potato squares) or the stacked potato column called Batata Harra at Albi. They’re culinary and architectural marvels.
