Anju, 1805 18th Street NW, Washington DC (Dupont Circle)

Anju, with its mix of traditional and updated takes on Korean homestyle dishes, remains a tough reservation almost five years after its opening. And it’s a fave of the food cognoscenti as well — Washingtonian named it the #1 restaurant in the DC area for 2020. Anju’s starters are all excellent, especially the craveable fried chicken with gochujang glaze and white bbq drizzle and the beef tartare (I do find myself wanting a better conveyance for the tartare than pretty-but-fragile lotus chips). For the main course, I beeline for whatever versions of fried rice and/or rice cakes are on the menu and then settle on a protein (or two). At brunch, it’s hard to resist the comfort of the Shrimp Juk. Unless it’s the decadence of the PB&J French Toast.
