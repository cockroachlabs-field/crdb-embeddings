This 1973 Datsun 240Z was reportedly purchased by the seller’s uncle in the mid-1970s before being inherited by the current owner in 1999 and now shows 40k miles. Work performed since 2020 is said to have involved replacing the floor pans, carpets, and weather stripping as well as repainting the body in silver. The car is powered by a 2.4-liter inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission, and additional equipment includes slotted 14″ mag-style wheels, front disc brakes, bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and an aftermarket CD stereo. This 240Z is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, partial service records, a set of hubcaps, and a clean Virginia title in the name of the seller and their spouse.
