The Lucid Air is a battery electric 4-door luxury sedan made by Lucid Motors. Announced in December 2016 and sold starting in 2021, it is designed to compete with the Audi e-tron GT, IM L7, BMW i5, BYD Han, Tesla Model S, Mercedes-Benz EQE, Porsche Taycan, Xpeng P7, NIO ET7, Neta S, and the Zeekr 001.[4][5]

The Dream Edition's EPA range is estimated at 520 mi (840 km).[1] The production model was unveiled in September 2020, and production began in late 2021.[6][7]

In November 2020, the Lucid Air Pure was announced with 406 mi (653 km) of projected range and 480 horsepower (360 kW) and a starting price of US$77,400.[8] The range of trim levels includes Pure, Touring, Grand Touring, and Dream Edition.[8]

On September 28, 2021, Lucid Motors announced that production had begun, with the base Pure model expected in late 2022.[9] Deliveries commenced on October 30, 2021, with the first reservation holders taking delivery of Air Dream Editions in an event in California.[10][11]
History

The Lucid Air was conceived in the early 2010s, with a prototype unveiled to the public in 2016,[4] and the production version unveiled in September 2020, with production planned for 2021.[6][7]

Lucid contracted with Samsung SDI on December 2, 2016, to supply batteries.[12][13]

In 2016, Lucid Motors created a delivery van with the prototype of its electric powertrain for the Air using batteries from its former brand, Atieva. Known as "Edna", the delivery van contained two gearboxes, motors producing over 900 hp (671 kW) and an 87 kWh battery pack. Combined with all-wheel drive and other physical and software updates, Edna was able to achieve 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.74 seconds and a quarter mile in 11.3 seconds.[14] According to Lucid Motors, Edna was used to test the real world performance of its powertrain, including "motor control algorithms, regenerative braking behaviors, accelerator pedal feel, and cooling strategies".[15]

In 2018, a modified Lucid Air prototype set an EV lap record of 1:41.67 at the Laguna Seca track, beating the Jaguar I-Pace's previous record of 1:48.18 by seven seconds.[16] The prototype Air was equipped with "Pirelli P Zero PZ4 summer tires, modified high temperature brake pads and fluid, a 6-point roll cage and fire suppression system".[17]

In 2018, Lucid Motors closed a US$1 billion investment deal with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to fund the Air production,[18] then expected to commence in late 2020 following the construction of the Lucid factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.[18] The factory investment was expected to reach US$675 million by 2025 when all phases are complete, with the first phase including a US$168 million investment in equipment and US$82 million to acquire property.[19]

By May 2019, the Air was available for pre-order in the United States and Canada, with plans slated for China.[20] In an interview, CEO Peter Rawlinson stated that China was projected as a significant market for Lucid Motors due to their intensive usage patterns, for which the Air is best suited.[21]

In a 2019 interview, Rawlinson outlined that the US$100,000-plus vehicle could be the first stage of a much bigger vision, which could achieve a level of energy efficiency that combined with a ubiquitous fast charging network, would counteract the need for larger batteries.[22] Rawlinson said that Lucid Motors aims to improve energy efficiency to 5 mi/kWh (8.0 km/kWh) compared to an industry average of 3 mi/kWh (4.8 km/kWh).[22] Rawlinson further predicted that the price of batteries was expected to drop to US$100 / kWh within the next decade, which he believes will enable Lucid Motors to produce a luxury EV for less than US$30,000.[22]

On June 30, 2020, Lucid Motors said that they expected the Lucid Air to be "the world's most aerodynamically efficient luxury car when it goes into production".[23] The company "achieved a new benchmark in aerodynamic efficiency for its luxury electric car … with tests recently completed at Windshear's advanced rolling-road wind tunnel, the automaker verified a coefficient of drag of 0.21."[23]

On May 5, 2022, Lucid Motors announced that it was raising prices of its luxury Air sedan beginning June 1. The price hikes would push the base price of the Air sedan up as much as 13%.[24]

In June 2024, Rawlinson announced that the Lucid Air (RWD) had achieved a record efficiency, covering 5 mi/kWh (8.0 km/kWh), up from its prior record-setting 4.7 mi/kWh (7.6 km/kWh).[25]
