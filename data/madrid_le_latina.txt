La Latina hosts the city’s oldest architecture (hence the name, the Latin Quarter) and some of its finest cuisine. The small alleyways nestled between 18th century buildings are especially beautiful. On Sundays, La Latina’s most famous street, La Cava Baja, is Madrid’s place to be. This charming street is lined with tiny bars serving up cañas (draft beer), wines and tapas. It’s tradition to go to this Madrid neighborhood on Sunday afternoons after the city’s flea market, El Rastro, and hop from bar to bar until late.
