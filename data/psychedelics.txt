In recent years, psychedelics have received a surge of interest for their therapeutic potential, promising care for those who have been forgotten and a vision of a broader collective transcendence. But as I write in a guest essay for Times Opinion this week, psychedelics research is facing a reckoning over poor clinical trial design and questionable practices that have led to premature confidence about their benefits and minimization of their risks.

For instance, we might think of ketamine as a cautionary tale for how other psychedelic therapeutics might be rolled out. While it may be a lifesaving antidepressant for some, it appears to have become another cog in the Rube Goldberg machine of human suffering that is modern Western medicine, turning pain into profits.

The risk profile of ketamine is probably better understood than that of other psychedelics, as its Schedule III classification has long allowed for its study. But while the drug has been used to great effect as a one-and-done anesthetic, we need more long-term safety data about repeated use of ketamine or the patented Johnson & Johnson reformulation, Spravato, which is used as an antidepressant.

We do know that the acute antidepressant effects, observed in the first 24 to 48 hours after ketamine infusions, do not appear to be lasting. In order to continue to benefit from ketamine, patients typically must use it repeatedly, which can have side effects including addiction, hallucinations, memory problems, delusions, aggression and even toxicity in the liver, kidneys and bladder.

This week, a spokesperson for the Drug Enforcement Administration warned that ketamine abuse was starting to resemble the beginning of the opioid crisis. The F.D.A. does not require data collection on adverse outcomes from ketamine clinics, but last fall it issued a warning that unsupervised treatment via telemedicine companies might be putting patients at risk.
