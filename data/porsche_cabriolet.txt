This 2012 Porsche 911 Carrera S cabriolet is a triple-black example that was acquired by the seller on BaT in February 2022 and now has 15k miles. It is powered by a 3.8-liter flat-six mated to a seven-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. The car is also equipped with the Sport Chrono and Light Design packages along with 20″ SportDesign alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlights, ParkAssist, heated power-adjustable front seats, a Bose sound system, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Service in May 2023 is said to have included replacing the drive belt, battery, and spark plugs. This 991.1 is offered with the owner’s manual, service records, and a clean New Jersey title in the seller’s name.

The car is finished in black and features bi-xenon headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS) as well as a black soft top, fog lights, front and rear parking sensors, LED taillights, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. Paint protection film has been applied to the hood and fenders. Hail damage repair under previous ownership is noted, and the Carfax report lists damage in October 2017. A blemish on the right quarter panel can be seen in the photo gallery.
