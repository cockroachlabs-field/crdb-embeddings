The first paragraph of “The Passenger” works as a microcosm of the problem. It paints a barren scene, a snowy field in which a young woman has hanged herself: “It had snowed lightly in the night and her frozen hair was gold and crystalline and her eyes were frozen cold and hard as stones.” Before you’ve even settled in, McCarthy has thrown “and” at you four times, a word that both splits and fuses. You hear Hemingway and the curious loudness of those supposedly clipped and stripped-down sentences. Something attention-seeking in the syntax. I read this novel when I was recovering from the infantilizing misery of a 15-millimeter kidney stone, and my 11-year-old daughter read parts of it to me because the pain pills made me want to barf when I tried to read, and at one point she put down the book and said, “Why does he say AND so much!”

Still, it was a thrill to hear new McCarthy sentences read aloud. The teetering wouldn’t be interesting if he weren’t capable of those spellbinding descriptive passages, a trademark. In the first paragraph he does one of his McCarthy things and makes you look up a chewy old word, “stogged.” The hunter who finds the woman, we are told, knelt and “stogged his rifle upright in the snow beside him.” To be stogged is to be stuck in the snow or mud. You can also stog something into the snow, like a stake. The way McCarthy deploys it, you hear what it means even before you know.
