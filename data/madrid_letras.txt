Barrio de Las Letras, also known as Huertas, is named after the many writers who lived there, such as Cervantes, Quevedo and Lope de Vega. You can actually visit Lope de Vegaâ€™s former house which is now a museum on c/ Cervantes, 11. Oddly enough, c/ Lope de Vega is parallel to it just one street down, where Cervantes is buried. This neighborhood is slightly different from Huertas, as it is less of a party town. There are many arts and crafts fairs and cultural sites hidden away here.
