Centrolina, 974 Palmer Alley NW, Washington DC (City Center)

Chef Amy Brandwein never turns out a bad dish. Not because she doesn’t take risks. She does, often defying settled expectations. I can’t imagine how many times her waitstaff has had to explain that, yes, the Bolognese sauce is white. Her dishes feel both grounded in elemental techniques — charred, pickled, burnt, or confited components are common — and yet completely elevated. It’s what our ancestors might have aspired to out on the savannah with better product and a bit of technique. Put differently, Chef Brandwein would be great on a camping trip.
