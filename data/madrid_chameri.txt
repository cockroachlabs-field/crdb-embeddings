You could call Chamberi ‘Moncloa’s older brother’, because it’s a much prettier neighborhood that caters to a slightly older crowd. Chamberí boasts beautiful architecture–some of its buildings are absolutely gorgeous, such as Museo Sorolla, Instituto Internacional and even the British Council. It also has quaint plazas such as Plaza de Chamberí and Plaza de Olavide, which is my favorite plaza for drinking and terraza time in all of Madrid. This Madrid neighborhood is also a business district with many offices and thus plenty of restaurants and bars throughout the area. One of the best streets for wining and dining is Calle Ponzano, where you can find great restaurants like Bar Lambuzo and Sala de Despiece
