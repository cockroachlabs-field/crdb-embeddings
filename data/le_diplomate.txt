Le Dipl√≥mate is worth the hype. Last Nov '23 I was able to book an early dinner 2 weeks in advance on a weekday.

Ambiance was phenomenal, classy, full of people but also warm and cozy. At first we were assigned seating outside in the tarp booths but we felt it was a little cold and also missing the inside vibe so they accommodated us inside, best decision!

Food: everything we ordered was delicious and you can tell the attention to the quality!
Eacargots were fresh, buttery and garlicky.
Pate was amazingly rich and creamy, perfect on their fresh baked baguettes
We shared their branzino, clams, strip steaks, they were all carefully seasoned and cooked to perfection.

Even though the place was packed, service was still great.
This is a must come back place for me!
