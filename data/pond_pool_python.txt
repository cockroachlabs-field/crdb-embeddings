Pond is probably the first publicly available object pooling library in Python with complete test cases, over 90% coverage, complete code comments, and good documentation.

Inspired by Apache Commons Pool, Netty Recycler, HikariCP, Caffeine. Pond counts the frequency of usage of each object pool using approximate counting with extremely little memory usage, and recycles it automatically.

The default policy and weights reduce the memory usage by 48.85% and the borrow hit rate at 100% when the traffic is more randomly averaged.
