 Lutece, 1522 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington DC (Georgetown)  

There’s so much to love at this jewel-box French spot that helped cement the re-foodie-fication of Georgetown. Signatures like the charred Napa cabbage, duck breast, Parisian gnocchi, and honey semifreddo are constants, although the specific preparations vary and most of the menu changes with the seasons. Grab a seat inside if you’re into close-quarter conviviality. I usually opt for a table on the sidewalk, which tends to be more peaceful except for the periodic Metrobus or when Yellow next door is running a wait.
