There are so many great dishes in the DC area. But if I had to pick my absolute favorite, it’d have to be Chef Seng Luangrath’s Naem Khoa (Laotian crispy rice salad). It’s always on the menu at her flagship Thip Khao and Padaek in Falls Church (although it’s not on the recent opening menu at Baan Mae, I hope it’s just a matter of time). The salad starts with coconut rice, lightly crisped and a bit warm (take-out unfortunately loses the crisp) and then tosses it with peanut, lime, scallion, cilantro, sour pork, mint, banana blossom, red onion, and a sprinkling of pixie dust. It comes with lettuce leaves for wrapping. It’s crunchy, nutty, sweet, sour, porky, salty, spicy, herbaceous, warm, cool, and funky. If you’re someone who hates it when different foods touch on your plate, it may not be for you. But if you’re like me and you’re constantly forking dibs and dabs from different sections of your plate looking for that perfect bite, this is your holy grail.

ps – There are lots of other great choices to fill out your order. Just know that much of it is spicy, and when they say spicy, don’t be like me — believe them:
