I've come here multiple times for both lunch and dinner because the food and service are consistently good. It is a little on the pricier side but I think thatâ€™s acceptable because there's very few Georgian restaurants. I always get the Kupati, a beef and pork sausage that comes with a pomegranate sauce, cilantro, shallots, and potato. As an appetizer I love the kachapuri on a skewer (cheese bread that comes with spicy adjika oil). I've also had the porcupine meatballs which are full of flavor and comes with polenta. The chili folded eggs are available at lunch and are perfectly cooked so it's eggy and moist. It comes with an adjika harissa sauce. Highly recommend coming here for a date night or special occasion.
