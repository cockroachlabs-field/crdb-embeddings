Lavapies is becoming one of the trendiest Madrid neighborhoods, despite its underground and rugged feel. This neighborhood has been occupied by African and Middle Eastern immigrants for many years. Lavapies now embraces its edgy culture, diverse cuisine and alternative nightlife. Just one stop from Sol, Lavapiés is the perfect place to check out Madrid’s changing personality, especially for its amazing Indian restaurants. In fact, I like to call Lavapiés street Curry Row because it’s lined with Indian restaurants. C/ Argumosa, another popular street, is lined with more hipster bars with tantalizing outdoor seating areas. It stretches right to Atocha Street behind the Reina Sofia Museum.
