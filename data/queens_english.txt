Like Moon Rabbit, Queen’s English is a highly personal restaurant delivering one-of-a-kind Asian flavors reflecting the chef’s roots. My regular reader (hi, mom!) won’t be surprised to see them both leading the pack. Queen’s English is run by husband-and-wife team of Henji Cheung and Sarah Thompson. Henji’s cooking is based on the Cantonese and Hakkanese flavors he grew up on, while Sarah runs the front of the house and the top-flight wine program (Sarah was named Michelin’s DC Sommelier of the Year for 2023). This is the place to try ingredients that may be less familiar or that some may be squeamish about (try the pig-ear salad). Veggie dishes like the Mushroom Mushroom and the Truffle Dumpling are so good you won’t miss the meat (which is a trope I hate because it’s rarely true; so you can trust me on this).
