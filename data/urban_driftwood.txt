In the past few years, Yasmin Williams has garnered a reputation as one of the foremost, innovative voices in instrumental acoustic guitar. Known for her distinctively designed instruments and idiosyncratic playing method of laying the guitar across her lap, Williams has developed a library of clever techniques for drawing a sound out of the instrument. While performing live, her presence is playful and astounding, a sonic and visual feast of acoustic guitar fireworks. Knowing this, Urban Driftwood, her most recent studio album to date, is surprisingly tranquil. Her fingers float across the fretboard, creating a serene atmosphere as smooth as a lakeâ€™s surface.
