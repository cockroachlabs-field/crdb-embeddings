Goodbye range anxiety, the 2025 Lucid Air is rated for up to 512 miles of driving per charge and has a pleasant interior that will make that long trip a comfortable one. While it may not be as outright luxurious as the BMW i7, the Lucid's overall performance is better both as an EV and as a sports sedan. Although the high-end Grand Touring and performance-oriented Sapphire trims wow with their big horsepower ratings and fancier amenities, the entry-level Pure and mid-range Touring trims are nearly as impressive and don't require six-figure outlays. All models come with impressive tech features, including the expected driver assists and infotainment goodies, but Lucid's real engineering marvels reside beneath the surface. The company's batteries, for example, feature a novel modular design, and its electric motors are smaller and lighter than those used in rival EVs but still pack plenty of power. If you've put your EV buying plans on hold out of concern for range, the Lucid Air may be compelling enough to convince you to pull the trigger on an electric car.
