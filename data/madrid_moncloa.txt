Moncloa and Arguelles are fantastic Madrid neighborhoods to live in, especially for young people. Madrid’s main university, La Complutense, is very close by. This area has tons of local bars and shops. Its important main street, Calle Princesa, has all the major shops from Zara to El Corte Inglés. In fact, Calle Princesa turns into the Gran Vía right after Plaza de España. It’s also a relatively quick walk from Sol (anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes depending on where you are, the neighborhood is quite large), and it is right next to the two most happening neighborhoods–Malasaña and Chueca. It also borders Chamberí, a slightly more expensive and residential neighborhood.
