Rabelo boat trip just for you and your group, with the duration you want.

We sail on an itinerary of your choice, and you can stop for baths on the river, if conditions permit.

Sunbathe, picnic your farnel or ours if requested, have lunch, enjoy a drink, maybe a Port wineâ€¦.

We advise navigation upstream, in a fantastic and quiet stretch of the Douro River, without national roads or traffic, and therefore not visible by car., with terraces up to the river, centenary buildings of vineyard farms, in a unique landscape considered World Heritage by UNESCO.

Itineraries with a lock let must be booked at least 48 hours in advance.

On itineraries for an amount of one or two hours we provide free audio information about what we see on the tour in: Portuguese, French, English, Spanish and German, to listen comfortably, and in safe mode, on your own mobile phone. For your comfort we do not have general sound systems in boats.

Our audio-guide system is available for Android and IOS. Install the Magnificent Douro app for free before you reach us. Open it and choose the language from Portuguese, French, English, Spanish and German. Then select the one- or two-hour tour and download its contents. When you get to our dock run the application and it will be automatically activated. During the tour will be issued the comment at the respective place. This application, when running, does not consume data.

We have open and closed rabelo boats, so we can sail all year round, and in any weather condition.
