wheel, Blaupunkt cassette player, tire inflator, and tool set. This 944

27k-Mile 1983 Porsche 944

The body is finished in India Red and features pop-up headlights,
removable sunroof, body-colored electrically operated side mirror, rear
window wiper, dealer-installed lighted heckeblende between the taillights,
and rear spoiler. Paint meter readings from multiple panels can be viewed
in the photo gallery below.


The 15'' Mahle Cookie Cutter wheels are fitted with 225/60 Firestone
Firehawk SZ50 EP tires in 2002.


The cabin features front seats upholstered in black leather, and rear
seats trimmed in matching black leatherette. Additional amenities include
electric windows, air conditioning, and Blaupunkt cassette stereo. The air
conditioning system was converted to use R134a refrigerant in 2017.


A four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer
and a tachometer along with gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level,
and instant fuel economy. The five-digit odometer shows under 27k miles,
of which approximately 500 were added by the current owner.


When new, the 2.5-liter inline-four engine was factory-rated at 143
horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 137 lb-ft of torque at 3,000 rpm. Service
performed in 2018 included replacement of all fluids including engine oil,
transaxle oil, brake fluid, and coolant. The 2018 service also included
replacement of the timing belt, water pump, thermostat and seal, and
balance shaft belt. The engine oil, filter, and brake fluid were replaced
again in May 2020. The original and tired hood and hatch gas springs were
replaced with new Stabilus gas springs in May 2020.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual
transaxle. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below.
