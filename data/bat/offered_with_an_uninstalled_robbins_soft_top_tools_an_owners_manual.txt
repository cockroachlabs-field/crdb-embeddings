This 1971 Triumph TR6 is powered a 2.5-liter inline-six paired with a
four-speed manual gearbox with overdrive, and it was acquired in July 2020
by the selling dealer. The car has been repainted in Laurel green and the
interior was reupholstered in tan vinyl as part of an older refurbishment
completed by a previous owner. Work performed between 2018 and 2020
included rebuilding the Zenith Stromberg carburetors, replacing the clutch
hydraulic cylinders and a solenoid for the overdrive unit, and installing
a new headliner and insulation in the removable hardtop. This TR6 is now
offered with an uninstalled Robbins soft top, tools, an owner's manual,
service and refurbishment receipts, handwritten records, and a clean Ohio
title.

The car was originally finished in red, and a color change to Laurel Green
was carried out following replacement of multiple body panels during
previous ownership. The frame is also said to have been dipped as part of
the refurbishment. The matching removable hardtop was refinished at the
time of the color change, while new insulation and a headliner were
installed between 2018 and 2020.
