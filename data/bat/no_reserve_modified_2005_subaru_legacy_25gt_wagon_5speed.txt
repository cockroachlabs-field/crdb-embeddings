This 2005 Subaru Legacy is one of 1,670 2.5GT wagons reportedly built with
a five-speed manual transmission, and it is powered by a turbocharged and
intercooled flat-four. The car is finished in silver over black leather,
and factory equipment includes five-spoke wheels, a sunroof, air
conditioning, a six-disc CD changer, and an all-wheel-drive system. In
early 2019 the seller acquired the car and has since modified it with a
BNR Supercars turbocharger, a DeatschWerks fuel pump, an aftermarket
exhaust system, and a Cobb Tuning Accessport. The car was subsequently
tuned on a dynamometer, and service during the seller's ownership has
included overhauling the brakes, changing the oil, and replacing the
valve-cover gaskets, radiator, engine sensors, spark plugs, oil control
valves, and battery. This Legacy wagon is now offered at no reserve with
service records from current ownership, dynamometer results, a maintenance
spreadsheet, manufacturer's literature, two sets of floor mats, a Carfax
report, and a clean Massachusetts title in the seller's name.

No Reserve: Modified 2005 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT Wagon 5-Speed

The car is finished in silver and features a hood scoop as well as dual
exhaust outlets. The paintwork and exterior trim are shown in detail in
the photo gallery below. The seller notes scratches and dings on the
exterior as well as rust at the underside of the doors, which has
discolored the rocker panels. The accompanying Carfax report indicates
that the rear of the vehicle sustained damage in a 2012 accident.


Factory five-spoke wheels exhibit curb rash and are mounted with Michelin
Pilot Sport A/S 3+ tires. The seller has flushed the brakes, installed
stainless-steel braided hoses, and replaced the brake pads, rotors, and
three calipers.


The cabin features bolstered front seats and a rear bench seat with black
leather upholstery over black carpeting, which is protected by rubber
floor mats. Features include cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate
control, and a factory stereo with a six-disc CD changer. The seller notes
an area where the dashboard material was torn off.


A three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of factory instrumentation. The
odometer shows approximately 117k miles, 4k of which have been added by
the seller over the past year.


The turbocharged and intercooled 2.5-liter flat-four delivers power to all
four wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The seller has
modified the car with the following components:

* BNR Supercars Evo3 16G turbocharger with stainless-steel oil feed
lines
* Perrin turbo inlet hose and turbo heat shield
* Cobb Tuning Accessport and electronic boost controller
* Manzo 3a** stainless-steel cat-back exhaust
* High-flow catalytic converter
* GrimmSpeed up pipe, Invidia down pipe
* DeatschWerks 65C fuel pump

A spreadsheet showing work performed by the seller from June 2019 through
June 2020 is pictured in the gallery.


July 2020 dynamometer results from BrenTuning Performance and Dyno in
Upton, Massachusetts indicate that the car produced a peak output of 315
horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque at the wheels.


Additional photos showing the suspension, the exhaust, and underbody
corrosion are presented in the gallery below.


The August 2020 Carfax report shows the aforementioned rear impact in 2012
as well as registration and service activity in Massachusetts. An
unaddressed airbag recall was issued in December 2019.
