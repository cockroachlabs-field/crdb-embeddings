This 2000 Porsche Boxster S is finished in Guards Red with a black soft
top over black leather, and power is supplied by a 3.2-liter flat-six
mated to a six-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes multi-piece 18''
Sport Design wheels, automatic climate control, cruise control, and a
Becker CD stereo. The car was first delivered to Scottsdale, Arizona, and
was acquired by the selling dealer from its first registered owner in June
2020. It now has 26k miles, and recent service included an alignment and
replacement of the tires. This 986.1 S is now offered at no reserve with
factory literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title.

No Reserve: 26k-Mile 2000 Porsche Boxster S 6-Speed

The exterior is finished in Guards Red (L84A) with a power-operated black
soft top. Features include dual integrated roll hoops, a speed-activated
rear spoiler, and fog lights. The Boxster S badge was removed, and the
selling dealer states that the paint has been blended on the left-side
where the car was reportedly keyed.


Optional 18'' Sport Design wheels feature caps with colored Porsche-crest
center caps and are wrapped in Sumitomo HTR Z5 tires measuring 225/40 up
front and 255/35 out back, which the selling dealer recently mounted. An
alignment was also performed, and braking is handled by red-finished
calipers and cross-drilled rotors at each corner.


The cabin features black leather seating surfaces with matching door panel
inserts and carpets. Amenities include automatic climate control, cruise
control, and a six-speaker Becker-Porsche CDR-220 audio system with
Digital Signal Processing (DSP).


The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a trio of cascading instruments
including a central tachometer with a 7,200-rpm redline and a 180-mph
speedometer. The digital odometer indicatesA  under 26k miles, less than
50 of which were added by the selling dealer.


The 3.2-liter flat-six is located in front of the rear cargo area, and was
rated at 250 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque when new. Power is sent to
the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle.
