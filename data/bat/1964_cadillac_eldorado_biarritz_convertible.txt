This 1964 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz is one of 1,870 convertibles produced
for the model year and was acquired by the seller in 2013. It is powered
by a 429ci V8 paired with a Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission. The
body was repainted in the original black during previous ownership, and
purple ghost flames were added to the hood and fenders. Additional
equipment includes front disc brakes, a dual exhaust system, polished
wheels, a black interior, a black convertible top with a vinyl boot,
chrome trim, a Pioneer CD stereo, and seating for six. The power-seat
motor and window controls were reportedly repaired in 2019, and an oil
change was performed in February 2020. This Eldorado convertible is now
offered with a clean Washington title in the seller's name.

1964 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz Convertible

The body was repainted in the original black during previous ownership,
and ghost flames in metallic purple were added to the hood and fenders.
Equipment includes a black convertible top with a boot, quad headlights,
and chrome bumpers and trim. The seller notes soft top repairs and dings
and scratches on the trim. Close-ups of the paint and brightwork can be
viewed in the gallery.


Goodyear tires are mounted on the polished five-spoke wheels. The front
brakes were upgraded to discs during previous ownership, and the factory
finned drums remain installed out back.


The cabin was reupholstered in the factory black and features replacement
seat covers and door panels. Amenities include power-adjustable seats,
auto-dimming headlights, a steering wheel with polished spokes, power
windows and door locks, woodgrain trim on the dashboard and door cards,
and a Pioneer CD stereo. Service in 2019 reportedly included installing a
rebuilt power-seat motor and replacing the seat relay and driver-side
window controls. The seller notes that the cruise control and remote trunk
release do not work and that the air-conditioning system was removed
during previous ownership.


Instrumentation consists of a 120-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and
gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer
shows 35k miles, approximately 1k of which were added by the seller. True
mileage is unknown.


The 429ci V8 produced 340 horsepower when new, and the seller states that
an oil change and chassis lube were performed in February 2020. Drips are
noted from the rear main seal and power steering seal.


Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Turbo-Hydramatic automatic
transmission. The dual exhaust system is pictured above and is said to
feature Flowmaster mufflers and polished finishers.
