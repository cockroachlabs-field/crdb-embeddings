18k-Mile 1993 Mazda Miata Limited Edition

Each of the 1,500 Limited Edition models for 1993 was finished in
Brilliant Black (PZ) and featured front and rear spoilers with a lower
rear valance. This example is also equipped with a black soft top,
aftermarket illuminated mirrors, and grille and trunk protectors. The
included tonneau cover and boot cover are shown in the gallery below,
along with an included Miata-logo front-end cover.


Forged 14'' BBS wheels wear 185/60 Bridgestone SF-325 tires, and the BBS
center cap-removal tool is included with the sale and shown in the gallery
below. Equipment also included a sport-tuned suspension with front and
rear stabilizer bars.


The 1993 Limited Edition was the only NA Miata to come with high-back
sport seats trimmed in red leather, and the interior features matching
door panels and carpets as well as a two-tone dashboard. Aluminum trim
accents the cabin, which is also equipped with air conditioning, cruise
control, a Nardi leather-wrapped shift knob, speakers integrated into the
headrests, and a stereo with CD and cassette players. A Windblox
windblocker is fitted and can be seen above.


Instrumentation set behind the leather-wrapped steering wheel includes a
140-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer, as well as gauges for oil
pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer
indicates just over 18k miles, approximately 16,500 of which were added by
the seller since 1994.


The 1.6-liter inline-four sends power to the rear wheels through a
five-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. The seller
states a tune-up was performed approximately 3k miles ago.


The exhaust features a tubular header and a sport-tuned stainless-steel
system. Additional underside photos are provided in the photo gallery.


The window sticker lists factory equipment and colors, delivery to Chuck
Nicholson Mazda, and a total vehicle price of $22,350.


The sale includes factory literature, red tonneau and boot covers, a
production tag, issues of Miata Magazine, and other accessories as shown
in the gallery.
