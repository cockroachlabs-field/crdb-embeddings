This 2019 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 was first delivered to Dan Cummins
Chevrolet-Buick of Paris, Kentucky, and it is finished in black over black
leather. Power is from a supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 V8 linked with a
rear-mounted seven-speed manual transaxle, and features include a
removable roof panel, a factory infotainment system, head-up display,
automatic climate control, Active Rev Match, Brembo brake calipers, an
adjustable magnetorheological suspension, and staggered-diameter wheels.
This C7 Z06 now has 9k miles and is offered on behalf of its owner with
factory literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.

2019 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 7-Speed

The car is finished in black with a color-matching removable carbon-fiber
roof panel. Z06-specific features include a carbon-fiber hood with
enlarged vents, enlarged fender vents and air inlet guide panels, enlarged
openings in the rear bodywork, a front splitter, and a fixed rear spoiler.


Factory alloy wheels measure 19a*^3 up front and 20a** at the rear and are
mounted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires measuring 295/30 and 335/25,
respectively. The Z06 is equipped with double-wishbone front and rear
suspension with adjustable magnetorheological dampers, and braking is
handled by red-finished Brembo calipers with slotted rotors at each
corner.


The cabin features magnesium-framed GT seats trimmed in Jet Black leather,
and additional amenities include automatic climate control, a head-up
display, factory infotainment system, and a tilt and telescoping steering
column.


The leather-wrapped steering wheel features a flat bottom and carbon fiber
trim, and factory instrumentation includes a digital display housing the
tachometer and secondary instruments flanked by an analog 220-mph
speedometer, a fuel gauge, and a boost gauge. Under 9k miles are shown on
the digital odometer.


The supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 V8 produces 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of
torque, and the power figures are noted on a placard mounted to the base
of the center stack. The car was most recently serviced by a Chevrolet
dealer in May 2020.


Power is sent to the rear wheels via a rear-mounted seven-speed manual
transaxle that features Active Rev Match. Additional photos of the
underside are provided in the image gallery.


The August 2020 Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage and shows
history in California from a single registered owner.
