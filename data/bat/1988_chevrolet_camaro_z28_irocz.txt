This 1988 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 IROC-Z convertible is finished in dark red
metallic over a red cloth interior, and power is from a 305ci LB9 V8
paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and limited-slip rear
differential. The car was purchased new from Paus Motors in West Point,
Nebraska and was recently acquired by the seller in Kansas. Equipment
includes 15'' wheels, a factory cassette radio with a graphic equalizer,
and a black soft top. This IROC-Z Camaro is offered with a copy of the
original invoice, owner's literature, AutoCheck and Carfax reports, and a
clean Kansas title in the seller's name.

1988 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 IROC-Z

The IROC-Z package was standard for the 1988 Camaro, and included a tuned
suspension, lowered ride height, stiffer Delco-Bilstein shocks, thicker
sway bars, and IROC-Z decals, as well as ASC-added chassis reinforcements
unique to convertible-bodied cars. This example is finished in Dark Red
Metallic with gold and black pinstripes and features a rear spoiler and
fender-top moldings, a vented hood panel, and front foglamps.


Optional 15'' wheels are finished in gold and wear older Goodyear Eagle GT
tires with 1997 date codes. The black soft top features a vinyl backlight
and is manually raised and stowed beneath a fitted boot as shown in the
gallery below. A crack is noted in the left front wheel cap.


The cabin is trimmed in red cloth over bucket seats with power adjustments
for the driver. Interior amenities include cruise control, power steering,
electric windows and mirrors, and air conditioning.


A Z28 badge is mounted on the dash, and the Delco cassette radio features
a five-band graphic equalizer. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a
tachometer with a 5k-rpm redline, a 115-mph speedometer, and a five-digit
odometer showing just under 8,500 miles, only a handful of which were
added by the seller, who notes that the trip odometer is not functioning
properly.


The 305ci V8 was selected with engine option LB9 and features tuned-port
fuel injection. Output was quoted rated at 195 horsepower with 295 lb-ft
of torque when new. The seller states that an oil change was performed in
2016.


A 700R4 automatic transmission and optional limited-slip rear differential
route power to the rear wheels. Additional chassis reinforcements were
added to IROC-Z cars, and further underbody photos are included in the
gallery below.


A copy of the original invoice lists options and equipment as well as an
MSRP of $19k. An owner's manual, warranty paperwork, and other factory
literature are included with the sale.


The August 2020 Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage and
displays history in Kansas. The report indicates that an Exceeds
Mechanical Limits title was issued in November 2012, while a corrected
title was issued in July 2019. An AutoCheck report containing similar data
is provided in the gallery below.
