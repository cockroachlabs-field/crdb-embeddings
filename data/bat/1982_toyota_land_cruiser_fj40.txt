This 1982 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40 is a US-market example that was
acquired in 2001 by the seller, who has added 4k of the 82k miles shown.
Power is from a 4.2-liter inline-six paired with a four-speed manual
transmission and a two-speed transfer case, and modifications include a
Weber carburetor, an exhaust header, and a lift kit. The truck is finished
in yellow over gray, and equipment includes a body-color removable
hardtop, a roll bar, and rear jump seats. This FJ40 is now offered with
half doors, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title in the
seller's name.

1982 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40

The truck was refinished in yellow during previous ownership and features
a body-color removable hardtop with a white-painted roof and a roof rack.
Additional exterior features include a tubular front bumper, a louvered
hood, a rear-mounted spare tire, and a receiver hitch. Canvas half doors
are included in the sale. No accidents are listed on the included Carfax
report.


Steel 15'' American Racing wheels are finished in white with blue and red
accents and wear Dunlop A/T Radial Rover tires. The truck is fitted with a
lift kit.


The interior features seats trimmed in gray vinyl with matching door
panels and black carpeting. Equipment includes a roll bar, inward-facing
rear jump seats, and a separate rear cabin heater. The rear cargo floor
was repaired during previous ownership, and close-up photos are provided
in the gallery below.


The steel dashboard is painted body-color and features a black top pad, a
Blaupunkt stereo, and a passenger-side grab handle. The three-spoke
steering wheel fronts an 85-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure,
fuel level, water temperature, and amperage. The six-digit odometer shows
82k miles.


The 4.2-liter 2F inline-six is equipped with a Weber downdraft carburetor
and an exhaust header. Power is sent to the rear of all four wheels
through a four-speed manual transmission and a two-speed transfer case.
The oil pan is leaking, the emission controls have been removed, and the
seller states that the engine requires a few cranks to start when cold.


Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below.


The Carfax report shows registration history in New York and no accidents
or other issues from its first entry in March 1999 through its most recent
in September 2019.
