This 1971 Alfa Romeo GTV coupe was modified during a five-year Autodelta
GTAm-style build by The Sports Car Shop/Vintage Underground in Eugene,
Oregon that was commissioned in 2014 by its previous owner. Power is from
a 2.0-liter Alfaholics twin-spark inline-four paired with a Quaife
sequential six-speed manual gearbox, and the car features widened bodywork
over a black interior with vintage racing-style seats. Additional features
include velocity-stack fuel injection, AEM Infinity engine management, and
a fiberglass dash as well as Alfaholics GTA brakes, suspension, and
magnesium wheels. This GTAm tribute is offered by the selling dealer with
build receipts and a clean Florida title.

Twin-Spark 1971 Alfa Romeo GTV 6-Speed

The body was disassembled, the rusted floorpans replaced, andA front and
rear fenderA flares added before being finished in its current dark blue.
Additional details include shaved bumpers and side markers as well as a
black mesh grille and yellow inboard driving lights. Chips can be seen on
the hood, roof, and lower bodywork, and the selling dealer notes several
scratches, cracks, and dings.


Magnesium 13'' reproduction GTAm wheels by Alfaholics are painted gold and
wear 8.2''x22.0'' Avon Historic all-weather racing tires. Ride height has
been lowered on Alfaholics GTA suspension including drilled front control
arms and rear trailing arms, dropped ball joints, adjustable coilovers,
and revised geometry with adjustable front camber settings and sway bars.
Alfaholics GTA disc brakes feature Fedoro pads over vented and slotted
rotors at all four corners.


An Alfaholics GTA Corsa bucket seat is equipped for the driver along with
a Stradale model for the front passenger, with both mounted on angled
runners. Lap belts are fitted for the front seats and rearA bench. The
headliner has been removed and the ceiling finished in body color. A
reproduction Hellebore steering wheel sits in front of a fiberglass dash.


Instrumentation includes a modified Jaeger tachometer reading to 10k rpm,
a 140-mph Veglia speedometer, and aftermarket auxiliary gauges monitoring
oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer
shows approximately 7k miles, with actual mileage unknown. The car retains
a three-pedal layout, while the shift lever for the Quaife six-speed
sequential gearbox extends through a body-colored housing atop the
transmission tunnel. The selling dealer states that the shift light is
currently not operational.


The 2.0-liter twin-cam inline-four features a twin-plug cylinder head with
oversized valves, electronic fuel injection with four individual intake
runners, electronic ignition with coils for each cylinder, and an AEM
Infinity engine management system. The seller states that the engine was
sourced from Alfaholics, while installation was performed by The Sports
Car Shop in coordination with Garage 808 of Eugene, Oregon. An oil change
was performed in preparation for the sale and a compression test video has
been provided.


The Quaife sequential manual transmission features six straight-cut
forward gears plus reverse and directs power to the rear wheels. Stainless
exhaust pipes are routed over the rear axle to accommodate the lower ride
height.


A 25-gallon ATL fuel cell is mounted in place of the stock tank, and the
seller states that the engine is tuned to run on 93-octane gasoline.


Build receipts pictured in the gallery document approximately $133k in
work from Vintage Underground of Eugene, Oregon, and a driving video can
