This 1977 Mercedes-Benz 350SL is a European-market model that was
federalized by Olivia Conversion Inc. of Los Angeles, California in
November 1988 and spent time in Arizona before being acquired by the
seller in 2018. Finished in dark blue over a tan interior, the car is
powered by a 3.5-liter V8 paired with a four-speed manual transmission and
equipped with 16'' AMG monoblock wheels, an AMG-style front valence, an
aftermarket steering wheel, and Recaro bucket seats. Work during the
seller's ownership included performing a repaint, refinishing the wheels,
re-trimming the seats, and installation of Euro-spec headlight. This R107
is now offered with partial service records, a color-matched hardtop, and
a clean Wisconsin title in the seller's name.

The car had been previously finished in red and was repainted its original
shade of Midnight Blue (904) during current ownership. Equipment includes
a black soft top, Euro-spec bumpers and glass headlights, and an AMG-style
front valence. The rear panel was reportedly replaced during the repaint,
and a color-matched hardtop accompanies the vehicle, though the trim
requires reassembly. The plastic driver-side window on the black soft top
is torn as shown in the image gallery below.


Refinished 16'' AMG monoblock wheels wear Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 tires
showing 2014 date codes. A non-matching Gullideckel spare is located
beneath the trunk floor.


The interior features manually-adjustable Recaro bucket seats re-trimmed
in tan upholstery with a matching dash, door panels, and carpets. The car
is equipped with crank windows and a wood shift knob. The radio is missing
and the Zebrano wood trim shows peeling.


An aftermarket wood-rimmed four-spoke steering wheel fronts a replacement
instrument cluster. The six-digit odometer indicated 167k miles, around 5k
of which were added by the seller. Total mileage is unknown.


The 3.5-liter V8 was factory-rated at 197 horsepower in European
specification. According to the seller, the accelerator linkage needs to
be repaired, the radiator is leaking coolant, and the fuel, hydraulic, and
cooling systems require servicing.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission.
