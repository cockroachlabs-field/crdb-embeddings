This 1986 Porsche 944 Turbo is finished in Sapphire Metallic over a black
interior and powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-four paired with a
five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car was
reportedly purchased new from Porsche/Audi of Bernardsville, New Jersey by
a PCA instructor for use in driving events and was acquired three years
ago by the seller, who has added approximately 1,300 of the 77k miles
shown. Modifications include Koni shocks, lowering springs, Turbo S sway
bars, steel control arms, and an Autopower roll bar. Work carried out
during the seller's ownership is said to have included replacing the
timing belt, fuel pump, air conditioning compressor, clutch, filters, and
more as detailed below. This 944 is now offered with service records,
factory manuals, spare parts, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean
New York title in the seller's name.

The body is finished in Sapphire Metallic (LY5V) and features integrated
fog lights, a sunroof, and a rear spoiler. The seller believes the front
bumper, headlight covers, and front panel below the hood were refinished
under previous ownership. Rock chips are noted on the rocker panels, and
additional finish flaws are highlighted in the gallery below.


The 16a** phone dial wheels measure 8'' wide in the front and 9'' in the
rear and are wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R tires. The suspension
features Koni yellow struts, lowering springs, Turbo S sway bars, and
steel control arms. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers with
aftermarket drilled front and solid rear rotors. A spare set of phone dial
wheels is included in the sale.


The interior is trimmed in black with matching door panels and carpets. An
Autopower roll bar has been added, and additional amenities include
power-adjustable sport seats, cruise control, electric windows and
mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an Alpine head unit, and
Porsche-branded floor mats. The air conditioning system has reportedly
been converted to R134a, and a video demonstrating the temperature is
provided here.
