This 1990 Nissan 240SX reportedly remained with the family of its original
owner in Ohio before being recently acquired by the seller. Now showing
74k miles, the car is powered by a 2.4L KA24E inline-four paired with a
five-speed manual transmission and is finished in red over a gray cloth
interior. The seller replaced the coolant reservoir and had the vehicle
detailed in preparation for the sale. This S13 hatchback is now being
offered by the seller at no reserve with the removed coolant reservoir,
partial maintenance receipts, a build sheet punchcard, a clean Carfax
report, and a clean Ohio title.

No Reserve: 1990 Nissan 240SX 5-Speed

The exterior is finished in Cherry Red Pearl (AH3) and features
retractable headlights, a removable pop-up sunroof, a power antenna, a
dual-outlet exhaust, and a rear spoiler. The seller notes a crack in the
windshield, dents around the roof, and other paint blemishes as shown in
the gallery below. No accidents or other damage is listed on the Carfax
report.


The factory 15'' wheels wear Bridgestone Turanza QL10 tires. The 240SX
came equipped with four-wheel disc brakes, front MacPherson struts, and
Nissan's multi-link independent rear suspension system.


The interior is trimmed in gray cloth with a matching glove box lid, door
panels, and carpeting. The A/C system reportedly remains setup for R12
refrigerant, and additional equipment includes manually-adjustable seats,
passive shoulder restraints, power windows, power mirrors, and a factory
cassette radio.


Behind the steering wheel sits an instrument cluster with a 115-mph
speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer flanked by an engine temperature
gauge and a fuel level gauge. The odometer shows 74k miles, only a handful
of which were added by the seller.


The 2.4L KA24E SOHC inline-four was factory-rated at 140 horsepower at
5,600-rpm and sends power to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual
transmission. The seller replaced the coolant reservoir, though the
removed item is included in the sale. An oil change was completed
approximately 1k miles ago in 2018.


According to the seller, the car was flat-towed behind an RV by the
original owner, and a tow wiring harness is tucked behind the front air
dam. Leaks are noted from the muffler, and additional underbody photos are
available in the gallery below.


The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and displays history
in Ohio from its first update in December 1996 through its most recent
entry in January 2019. A walk-around and interior tour video is presented
below.
