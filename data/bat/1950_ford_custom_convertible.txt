This 1950 Ford Custom convertible is finished in dark red over a two-tone
brown and tan interior and spent approximately 50 years in California,
where it was reportedly refurbished around 2000 and then relocated to
Virginia. The seller acquired the car out of Massachusetts in 2015 and
moved it to Ohio. Power comes from a 239ci flathead V8 backed by a
column-shifted three-speed manual transmission equipped with overdrive.
Modifications include the installation of Edelbrock cylinder heads, an
Isky camshaft, an Edelbrock carburetor, and Fenton exhaust headers as well
as a 12-volt conversion of the electrical system. This shoebox Ford is now
offered with spare parts, a car cover, maintenance records from current
and prior ownership, and a clean Ohio title in the seller's name.

1950 Ford Custom Convertible

The body was refinished with a two-stage enamel dark red finish during
prior ownership and features chrome trim, dual spotlights, and rear fender
skirts. The paintwork and trim are shown up close in the photo gallery
below, as are bubbles on top of the driver's door, a scratch on the trunk
lid, and stone chips. The power-operated tan convertible top is said to be
a replacement component that exhibits fitment issues around the front
windows, and videos provided by the seller demonstrate the top opening and
closing.


Painted 15a*^3 steel wheels are equipped with Ford-branded hubcaps and are
mounted with wide-whitewall radial tires. A full-size spare with an
Allstate radial is fitted in the trunk, and suspension updates include a
set of air shocks installed at the rear.


The interior features front and rear bench seats reupholstered in two-tone
brown and tan vinyl, joined by matching two-tone door panels with chromed
window cranks. Brown carpeting and a tan roof liner completes the interior
trim, and additions include a solid-state AM/FM radio and an aftermarket
turn-signal stalk. The Magic Air heater housed in the passenger-side
footwell is inoperative according to the seller. A video by the seller
further shows the interior.


The body-color dashboard houses a centralized cluster with readings for
speed, engine temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and amperes. The
five-digit odometer shows just over 10k miles, approximately 9,900 of
which have been added by the seller. Actual mileage is unknown.


The 239ci flathead V8 was rebuilt under prior ownership according to the
seller. A four-barrel Edelbrock carburetor with a chrome filter housing is
fitted atop an Edelbrock intake manifold. Further additions include
high-compression Edelbrock cylinder heads, an Isky camshaft, and Fenton
headers. The car has been rewired and converted to a 12-volt electrical
system.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through an overdrive-equipped three-speed
manual transmission. Per the seller, the overdrive is inoperative due to
the electrical conversion, and the engine runs hot when idling for
extended periods of time. The car was treated with an undercoating during
prior ownership, and more underbody photos are provided in the gallery.
