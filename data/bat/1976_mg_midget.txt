This 1976 MG Midget is finished in blue over a black vinyl interior and is
powered by a 1,493cc inline-four mated to a four-speed manual
transmission. The car reportedly underwent a refurbishment during previous
ownership, and equipment includes a black convertible top, gray-painted
wire wheels, a modern head unit, a Weber carburetor, and more. This Midget
is offered by the selling dealer with service manuals, receipts, and a
clean Pennsylvania title.

1976 MG Midget

The body has been refinished in blue with flat black rocker panels.
Polished trim surrounds the headlamps, windshield, and rocker panels, and
the car retains rubber bumpers and US-market lighting. The black vinyl
convertible features a plastic rear window and shows wrinkling.


The 13'' wire wheels are painted gray with chrome center caps and wear
Road King Grenadier SE tires measuring 185/60. A spare steel wheel without
a tire is included in the sale.


The cabin features black vinyl upholstery on the bucket seats as well as
matching side panel trim and carpets. The car is equipped with a modern
head unit paired with dual speakers mounted in the center stack, and a
power adapter has been added to the cigarette lighter socket.


A three-spoke steering wheel with an MG center cap frames chrome-ringed
Smiths instrumentation including a five-digit mechanical odometer that
reads approximately 61k miles, though actual chassis mileage is unknown.


The 1,493cc inline-four features a single Weber carburetor with an
aftermarket air cleaner assembly. Power is sent to the rear wheels through
a four-speed manual transmission. An inspection was performed and the
carburetor was adjusted by the selling dealer.
