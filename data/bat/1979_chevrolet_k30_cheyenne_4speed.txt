This 1979 Chevrolet K30 is a one-ton 4 *4 pickup finished in two-tone
brown and tan over a tan interior and was manufactured at the Baltimore,
Maryland plant. Power comes from a 350ci V8 driving the rear or all four
wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a two-speed transfer
case with a locking rear differential. Factory equipment includes the
Cheyenne package, as well as towing mirrors, air conditioning, power
steering, heavy-duty shocks, and dual fuel tanks. This K30 was recently
acquired by the selling dealer in Michigan and is now offered for sale
with a clean West Virginia title.

The truck was finished from the factory in two-tone Cordova Brown Metallic
and Santa Fe Tan, and a repaint was reportedly carried out during previous
ownership. Exterior features include towing mirrors, tinted glass, a
sliding rear window, and chrome bumpers. Corrosion is noted along the base
of both doors as shown in the photo gallery below.


White-painted steel wheels with factory hubcaps wear BFGoodrich
All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires sized 235/85. Heavy-duty shock absorbers and
dual fuel tanks were optioned from the factory, along with power-assisted
steering and brakes.


The cabin features a bench seat trimmed in Camel vinyl with lighter tan
carpeting. The previous owner reportedly replaced the door panels and
added Chevrolet-branded rubber floor mats. The Delco radio is inoperable,
and other noted imperfections include a split on the dash and a tear along
the driver's side of the bench seat.


Stock instrumentation provides readings for speed, voltage, oil pressure,
water temperature, and fuel levels. The five-digit mechanical odometer
reads just over 28k miles, though total mileage is unknown.


The 350ci LS9 V8 was rated at 165 horsepower at 3,600 rpm and 270 lb-ft of
torque at 2,900 rpm when new. A four-speed manual transmission sends power
to the rear or all four wheels through a two-speed transfer case and a G80
locking differential.


Corrosion is noted on the underside, and additional photos showing the
frame, suspension, and bed are provided in the gallery. A walk-around
video with the engine idling is presented below.
