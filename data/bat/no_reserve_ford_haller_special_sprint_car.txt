This Ford sprint car is believed to have been built in the 1930s and was
acquired by the seller in 2013. It has since been used for shows and
parade laps during racing events held at California tracks in Lemoore,
Madera, Bakersfield, and Stockton. The body is finished in white and red
#8 livery, and power comes from a Ford Model B-sourced 201ci inline-four
paired with a Ford three-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a
Cyclone cylinder head, dual Stromberg 81 carburetors, mechanical drum rear
brakes, Delco Lovejoy lever shocks, and a custom-built radiator. This
Sprint car is now offered at no reserve with a bill of sale.

No Reserve: Ford "Haller Special" Sprint Car

The body is fabricated from steel with an aluminum hood and hood side
panels, and is finished in white with red accents and red frame and
suspension components. The plexiglass windshield shows crazing and cracks,
and the period decals on the cowl are said to be removable.


16'' 1935 Ford wire wheels wear Commander polyester four-ply tires on the
front and knobbed Allstate Super Traction Grip tires on the rear, and the
seller notes that all are cracked. Braking is via mechanical drums at the
rear controlled by a hand lever on the left side of the body, and the
suspension utilizes transverse leaf springs paired with Delco Lovejoy
lever-style shocks front and rear.


The cockpit features a padded seat upholstered in red vinyl, an
aircraft-style lap belt stamped "TESTED 3/15/45", and a three-spoke
steering wheel wrapped in black tape. The top of the transmission case is
exposed to the driver's legs, and the shifter is oriented centrally
beneath the steering column.


The flat aluminum dash houses fuel and ignition switches, a 110-mph
speedometer, and gauges for fuel pressure and water temperature. The
five-digit odometer shows 3,500 miles, though true mileage is unknown.


The 201ci inline-four was sourced from an early-1930s Ford Model B and
features a Cyclone racing cylinder head, a finned and polished intake
manifold, dual Stromberg 81 carburetors, and a custom exhaust header
feeding into a single exhaust pipe running down the right side of the
body. According to the seller, recent service included a rebuilt water
pump, a replacement fuel pump, a new custom radiator, an ignition tune-up
with new spark plugs and points, and a replacement battery.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ford three-speed manual
transmission. Additional underside and chassis photos are provided in the
gallery.
