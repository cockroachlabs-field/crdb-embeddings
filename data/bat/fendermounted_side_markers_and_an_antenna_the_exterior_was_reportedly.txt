This 1967 Alfa Romeo Spider Duetto left the factory on June 18, 1967 and
is finished in red with a black convertible top over a black vinyl
interior. Power comes from a twin-cam 1,570cc inline-four paired with a
five-speed manual gearbox, and features include four-wheel disc brakes,
plexiglass headlight covers, and 14a*^3 GTA-style aluminum wheels. The
seller's husband acquired the car on BaT in August 2019 before his
unfortunate passing later that year. The valve cover gasket, radiator
hoses, fluids, and filters were replaced in September 2019, and the brakes
were serviced in July 2020. This Duetto is now offered with service
records, parts receipts, spare parts, an owner's manual, a spare tire and
jack, and a clean Texas title.

The Pininfarina-styled bodywork is finished in red and features plexiglass
headlight covers, polished stainless steel bumpers and overriders,
fender-mounted side markers, and an antenna. The exterior was reportedly
wet-sanded and polished during current ownership, and close-up photos of
the paint, trim, and lenses are provided in the gallery below.
