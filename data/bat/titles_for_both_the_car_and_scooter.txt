This 1983 Honda City Turbo II was imported from Japan by Nippon Imports of
Jacksonville, Florida before being acquired by the seller in May 2018. It
is finished in Windsor Dark Blue Metallic with multi-color decals, and the
right-hand-drive interior features two-tone blue and silver cloth, air
conditioning, and an in-dash beverage cooler. Power comes from a
turbocharged 1.2L inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transaxle,
and maintenance in 2018 included cleaning the gas tank and replacing the
fuel pump and filter. The car is accompanied by a Motocompo finished in
yellow, which was serviced in August 2020 with an oil change and fuel
system work. This City Turbo II and Motocompo scooter are now offered by
the seller with owners manuals, services invoices, and clean Arizona
titles for both the car and scooter.

No Reserve: 1983 Honda City Turbo II with Motocompo

The car is finished in Windsor Dark Blue Metallic with Turbo II decals on
