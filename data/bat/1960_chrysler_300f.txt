This 1960 Chrysler 300F is one of 964 hardtop coupes built and was
purchased by the seller in Pennsylvania in 1998. It was refurbished
between 2000 and 2002 and is finished in Alaskan White over a tan leather
interior. Power comes from a 413ci V8 with cross-ram induction paired with
a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes power-swiveling
front seats, power-assisted brakes, power steering, power windows, power
locks, a push-button AM radio, a power antenna, an auto-dimming rear-view
mirror, and an automatic headlight dimmer. This 300F is now offered with a
1960 Chrysler service manual and parts catalog, an operating and
maintenance guide, service records since 1998, and a clean Pennsylvania
title in the seller's name.

1960 Chrysler 300F

The body was refinished in Alaskan White during the early 2000s
refurbishment and features unibody construction, a faux spare-tire cover,
outward-swept rear fins, tinted glass, and a power-operated antenna.
Bubbling can be seen on the passenger-side lower fender behind the front
wheel.


The steel wheels wear factory 300-branded covers and are wrapped in Coker
American Classic whitewall tires. The seller states that an alignment was
performed in 2019 and that the tires need balancing.


The interior is trimmed in tan leather said to be sourced from Gary Goers
Classic Car Restoration, along with matching door panels, black carpets,
and a black and tan dash. Amenities include power swiveling front seats,
rear bucket seats, power door locks, a push-button AM radio with a rear
speaker, power windows, a "Mirror-Matic" auto-dimming mirror, and an
automatic headlight dimmer. The factory air-conditioning system remains
installed, but the seller states that the compressor needs to be repaired.


The AstraDome instrument cluster contains a 150-mph speedometer and gauges
for amperage, fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. A 6k-rpm
tachometer is mounted in the center stack, and the five-digit odometer
shows 21k miles, approximately 5k of which were added by the seller in 22
years. The seller believes that the odometer has rolled over, though true
mileage is unknown.


The 413ci Wedge V8 is topped with a long cross-ram intake manifold and
dual four-barrel carburetors. It was factory rated at 375 horsepower. The
seller notes an exhaust gasket leak and states that the oil was changed
approximately 1k miles ago.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed TorqueFlite
automatic transmission. Additional underside photos are provided in the
gallery.
