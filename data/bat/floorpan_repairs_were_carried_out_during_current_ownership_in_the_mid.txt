This 1968 Porsche 911 coupe was completed on July 12, 1968, near the end
of short wheelbase production. Finished in Burgundy Red over black
leatherette, the car was acquired by the current owner in July 1976 from
its second owner. Power is provided by a carbureted 2.0L flat-six paired
with a Type 901/05 five-speed manual transaxle. Features include front
seat headrests, a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, a collapsible antenna, and 15''
replica Fuchs wheels. A valve adjustment and tune-up were performed in
December 2018, and Weltmeister oil return tubes were also installed at
that time. This 911 is now offered on behalf of the current owner by his
son-in-law with an owner's manual, tool roll, Porsche Production
Specifications certificate, four steel wheels, additional spare parts, and
a clean Indiana title.

44-Years-Owned 1968 Porsche 911 Coupe

Delivered from the factory in Champagne Yellow (16153), the Karmann-built
body was repainted in silver in the early 1970s during previous ownership.
Floorpan repairs were carried out during current ownership in the mid
1980s, and a new right-front fender and new front bumper were also
installed along with new rear quarter panels and inner and outer rockers.
The car was repainted at that time in its current Burgundy Red, a Porsche
color that was available in 1968. The current owner has highlighted dings
and other imperfections on a diagram attached in the gallery.
