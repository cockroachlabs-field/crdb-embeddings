This 1977 Porsche 911S was purchased by the seller in 2015 and has been
modified as a rally tribute. It is finished in yellow with black graphics
over a yellow and black interior, and power comes from a 2.7-liter
flat-six paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Modifications include
hood-mounted driving lights, a roof rack carrying a spare tire, RS-style
rear fender flares, a roll bar, Simpson racing harnesses, a Cobra CB
radio, yellow plaid interior inserts, dash-mounted stopwatches, and an MSD
electronic ignition control box. This 911 rally tribute is now offered
with a clean California title in the seller's name.

Rally-Style 1977 Porsche 911S

The body is finished in yellow with black stripes, #59 livery, and Carrera
door scripts. Modifications include RS-style rear fender flares, HID
headlights, hood-mounted Cibie driving lights, a roof rack and spare tire
carrier, a rear fog lamp, and 911R-style taillights. The seller notes
paint chips and scratches and that the right rear quarter panel shows
fading paint.


15'' Fuchs-style wheels feature black centers and are wrapped in Michelin
X-Ice tires measuring 195/55 up front and 205/65 out back. Drilled and
ventilated brake rotors are fitted at all four corners, turbo tie rods
have been fitted, and the seller states that the front shocks and upper
mounts were replaced in 2020.


The interior is trimmed in black vinyl with yellow plaid inserts on the
seats, matching black door panels, and black and yellow plaid dash trim.
Salt and pepper carpets are covered with black and yellow Coco Mats, and a
yellow-painted roll bar is installed behind the front seats. Additional
equipment includes Simpson harnesses, a center armrest with a cup holder,
a Cobra CB radio, a Pioneer CD stereo, and a dash-mounted cup holder.


Instrumentation consists of a 10k-rpm tachometer, a white 150-mph
speedometer, a voltmeter surrounded by yellow plaid, and gauges for fuel
level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. Two Sears stopwatches
are mounted to the lower dash, and the six-digit odometer shows 212k
miles, approximately 20k of which were added by the seller in five years.
True mileage is unknown.


The 2.7-liter flat-six is fitted with Turbo-style valve covers, and
additional modifications include an MSD electronic ignition control box,
Carrera hydraulic tensioners, and an M&K exhaust with removable baffles.
According to the seller, service performed in February 2020 included a
replacement distributor, coil, fuel hoses, and engine oil.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 915 five-speed manual
transaxle. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery, and
