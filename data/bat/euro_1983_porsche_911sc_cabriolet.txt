This 1983 Porsche 911SC cabriolet is a European-market example that was
recently acquired by the current owner following long-term storage. The
car is finished in Grand Prix White over a black interior and is powered
by a 3.0-liter flat-six paired with a five-speed manual transaxle.
Equipment includes a black soft top, 16'' Fuchs wheels, H4 headlights, air
conditioning, a custom stereo system, and power windows. Service performed
during current ownership included refinishing the wheels, a fluid service,
overhauling the fuel system, and replacement of the tires, battery,
decklid shocks, and clock. Now showing 58k miles, this 911SC cabriolet is
offered on behalf of its current owner with recent service records, a
clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title.

The body is finished in Grand Prix White with a black soft top, and the
current owner states the right-rear quarter panel was refinished to
correct cosmetic flaws. Equipment includes H4 headlights with washers and
rear fender guards, and close-up photos of top, lenses, and body are shown
in the gallery below.


Forged 16a*^3 Fuchs wheels were recently refinished with black centers,
and wear Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3+ tires measuring 205/55 up front and
225/50 out back that were fitted in May 2020.


The interior features seats trimmed in black leather along with a matching
dashboard, door panels, and carpets that are protected by
Cabriolet-branded floor mats. Equipment includes a three-spoke
leather-wrapped steering wheel, power windows, and a Kenwood stereo with
Boston Acoustics door speakers. The air-conditioning system was converted
to R134a refrigerant in March 2020.


Factory VDO instrumentation includes a central 7k-rpm tachometer, a
180-mph speedometer, and a clock, as well as gauges for oil temperature,
oil level, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows
under 58k miles, approximately 500 of which were added by the current
owner. The clock was recently replaced.


The air-cooled 3.0L flat-six is paired with a 915 five-speed manual
transaxle. Service performed during current ownership included an oil
change and replacement of:

* Fuel pump
* Accumulator
* Air box pop-off valve
* Battery
* Air filter
* Hood and deck lid shocks
* Sound pad
