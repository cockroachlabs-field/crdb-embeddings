1986 Porsche 911 Turbo

The body is finished in Garnet Red Metallic and features front and rear
spoilers, a sunroof, a rear wiper, tinted windows, and integrated front
fog lights. 993-sourced side mirrors and door handles are fitted, the
windshield was replaced in 2019, and the headlight trim was refinished in
2019 to repair stone chips. The seller notes that paint meter readings
performed in 2016 showed evidence of prior paintwork performed on the
hood, the right front fender, and the left rear quarter panel.
Hand-written notes with the paint meter readings are shown in the gallery
below.


Staggered-width 16a*^3 Fuchs wheels were refurbished by Fuchs Restoration
Services in 2016, and are wrapped in Toyo Proxes tires measuring 225/50 up
front and 245/45 out back. Cross-drilled rotors and four-piston brake
calipers are fitted at each corner, and Bilstein shocks are fitted out
back.


The cabin features seats trimmed in Champagne leather with matching
carpets protected by Turbo-script floor mats, along with a brown
leather-trimmed dashboard and two-tone door panels. Amenities include
power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and an Alpine CD stereo.
An aftermarket shift knob is installed, and the seller notes that the
air-conditioning system will lose refrigerant charge if the vehicle is not
driven often.


The MOMO steering wheel wrapped in leather fronts factory VDO
instrumentation consisting of a 7k-rpm tachometer with an inset boost
gauge and a 170-mph speedometer, along with gauges for fuel level, oil
temperature, oil level, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows
under 106k miles, approximately 2k of which were added by the seller.


The turbocharged 3.3L flat-six was reportedly modified during prior
ownership with twin-plug heads, heavy-duty cylinder head studs, an
Electromotive XDi crankshaft-trigger distributorless ignition system, a
MoTeC M48 electronic fuel injection and engine management system, and a
KKK K27-7200 turbocharger. An inspection performed at Gulf Performance
Center in Pompano Beach, Florida in January 2017 at 103k miles included
compression and leak-down tests, the results of which are pictured in the
gallery.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 930/36 four-speed manual
transaxle. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery.
