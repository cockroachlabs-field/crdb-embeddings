This 2001 Porsche Boxster S is finished in Seal Grey Metallic over black
and grey leather and is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six mated to a
six-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a black soft top, heated
and power-adjustable seats, a sport suspension, an aftermarket exhaust
system, and the Sport and Sport Design packages. The car was first
delivered to Sonnen Motorcars in San Rafael, California, and was recently
acquired by the selling dealer. It now has 60k miles, and recent service
included replacement of the oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensor, and fuel
feed bleeder valve. This Boxster S is now offered at no reserve with
factory literature, accessories, service records, a Monroney label, a
clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.

No Reserve: 2001 Porsche Boxster S 6-Speed

The car is finished in Seal Grey Metallic (Y1 ) and features a
power-retractable black fabric soft top, power-adjustable mirrors, and a
speed-activated rear spoiler. Scratches and paint chips are highlighted in
the gallery below.


Factory 17a*^3 wheels wear painted Porsche-crest center caps and are
fitted with Yokohama tires, and the selling dealer states that the fronts
would benefit from being replaced. The Rigidly Tuned Special Chassis was
optioned, which featured a lower ride height, larger sway bars, and
stiffer dampers and springs. Braking is handled by red-finished calipers
over drilled rotors at each corner.


The cabin features heated and power-adjustable seats trimmed in black and
grey leather, along with two-tone door panels and black carpets that are
protected by Boxster S-logo floor mats. Additional equipment includes
automatic climate control, cruise control, and a Pioneer head unit with
aftermarket speakers.


Instrumentation consists of a 8k-rpm central tachometer and a 180-mph
speedometer, as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The
digital odometer shows under 60k miles, less than 100 of which were added
by the selling dealer.


The mid-mounted 3.2L flat-six was factory rated at 250 horsepower and 225
lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed
manual transaxle. The battery was replaced in 2019, and service in June
2020 by Leo & Son Garage in Bellflower, California included replacement of
the oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensor, and fuel feed bleeder valve. The
car most recently passed a California emissions test in June 2020.


An aftermarket exhaust system is fitted, and additional photos of the
underside, suspension, and brakes are viewable below.
