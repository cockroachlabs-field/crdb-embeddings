This 1974 Ford Bronco was refurbished and modified during prior ownership.
The body was refinished in orange, the suspension was lifted, 35'' tires
mounted on Mickey Thompson alloy wheels were mounted, a Bestop soft top
and fiberglass door inserts with removable curtains were fitted, and sport
seats and harnesses were installed in the interior along with a custom
audio system. Power comes from a 302ci V8 paired with a three-speed
automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case with four-wheel
drive, and additional modifications include a custom exhaust system and
four-wheel disc brakes. The seller acquired the truck six years ago, and
it was previously listed in a July 2020 Bring a Trailer auction. This
Bronco is now reoffered by the same seller with two tops, recent service
records, and a clean Connecticut title in the seller's name.

Modified 1974 Ford Bronco

The truck was refinished in orange prior to the seller's acquisition, and
modifications include fiberglass door inserts with removable black vinyl
panels and curtains, as well as plastic fender flares, tubular step bars,
and a Bestop soft top that fits over the roll bar on a separate frame. The
hood was replaced and refinished during current ownership and chips are
noted around the body, with detail photos of an area on the rear tailgate
provided in the gallery.


A suspension lift was fitted and the rear fenders cut to accommodate 35
*12.5'' Mud King XT tires mounted on 15'' Mickey Thompson alloy wheels.
Braking is provided by four-wheel discs that were installed during current
ownership. The seller notes vagueness in the steering.


The interior features a pair of adjustable sport seats with four-point
harnesses as well as a matching rear bench. Aftermarket audio components
include a vintage-look head unit with Bluetooth, amplifiers hidden under
the dash, JL Audio speakers mounted to the transmission tunnel and roll
bar, and a custom jerry can-style enclosure housing a JL Audio subwoofer.
The windshield wiper motor was replaced during current ownership.


A two-spoke steering wheel with chrome trim is mounted ahead of a
body-colored dashboard, which houses a 100-mph speedometer with nested
readouts for voltage, coolant temperature, fuel level, and oil pressure.
The five-digit odometer reads under 68k miles, approximately 5k of which
were added by the seller. Total mileage is unknown, and the fuel-level
gauge does not work.


The 302ci V8 is modified with ribbed rocker covers, an aftermarket
carburetor with an electric choke, an aluminum radiator, and a custom
exhaust system from the headers back.


Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed
automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The transmission
was reportedly rebuilt within the last 1k miles, and additional underside
photos are provided below.
