This 1968 Mercury Cougar XR7 hardtop was originally purchased from Bill
Hopkins Lincoln Mercury of Torrance, California, and it was reportedly
acquired by the seller from the second owner approximately seven years ago
with a non-original 289ci V8 under the hood and a factory automatic
transmission. The seller subsequently installed a replacement 390ci FE V8
and a Tremec T-56 Magnum six-speed manual gearbox. The engine was rebuilt
and the differential seal replaced in mid-2020. Refinished in the factory
Madras Blue over Aqua, the car also features modified suspension
components and Cragar wheels. This Cougar XR7 is now offered with a Deluxe
Marti report, an extra set of factory wheels, spare parts, service records
dating back to 1977, sales paperwork from 1967, and a clean California
title in the seller's name.

The exterior is finished in Madras Blue (F) and is said to have been
repainted twice, with Ivory vinyl tops replaced in 1985 and 1997. Photos
of the retractable headlight covers in their opened and closed positions
are provided in the gallery below; an electric motor conversion kit from
CatHeadlights was installed, and a video of the headlight operation can be
viewed here. The seller reports that evidence of frame repair at the
driver-side rear suggests a rear-end collision during prior ownership, and
potential corrosion is noted at the driver-side A-pillar.


Staggered-width 17'' gray Cragar wheels with chrome lips and center caps
are wrapped in BFGoodrich g-Force Sport Comp-2 tires measuring 215/50 in
front and 235/45 at the rear; the tires display 2015 date codes. A spare
set of factory styled wheels with Hankook Optimo H72 whitewall tires is
also included in the sale and shown in the gallery.


The interior was reportedly reupholstered in Aqua vinyl (6K) with matching
carpeting, and the factory door panels were retained and refurbished as
replacement units were unavailable. Additional interior features include a
radio and a Hurst shifter with a white knob.


A wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a woodgrain dashboard with factory
instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and
auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer displays 90k miles,
approximately 4,500 of which have been added by the seller in seven years;
true mileage is unknown.


A 390ci FE V8 was installed during current ownership, returning the car to
its factory displacement. The engine was built and installed by Hot Rod
Performance of Torrance, California. The engine was rebuilt in mid-2020
following a recent service mishap in which a piece of an intake-manifold
gasket made its way into one of the cylinders, causing damage to the
piston. The shop subsequently rebuilt the engine free of charge, and an
invoice for this work at Norm's Automotive Center of Los Alamitos,
California provided in the gallery documents piston and ring replacement,
engine seal replacement, and the original commissioned work of replacing
the differential seal, speedometer cable, and intake-manifold gasket.
Accompanying service records are said to date back to 1977.


Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Tremec T-56 Magnum six-speed manual
transmission. Additional photos of the underbody and suspension components
are presented in the gallery below.


The Deluxe Marti report shows the factory-installed options, color scheme,
production numbers, and more. The December 1967 purchase order from Bill
Hopkins Lincoln Mercury is depicted in the gallery.
