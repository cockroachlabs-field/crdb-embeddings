This 1994 Honda Civic Del Sol Si reportedly remained with its original
owner in Delaware for much of its life and was acquired in 2020 by the
selling dealer following several years in storage. Subsequent
recommissioning included replacement of the timing belt, water pump, brake
pads and rotors, valve cover gasket, and more. The car is finished in
Samba Green over a black interior, and the 1.6L VTEC inline-four sends
power to the front wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. This
Del Sol shows just 38k miles and is being offered by the selling dealer
with the factory warranty booklet, a receipt from the recent work, a clean
Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title.

38k-Mile 1994 Honda Civic Del Sol Si 5-Speed

The body is finished in Samba Green Pearl (GY15P) and features a removable
roof panel along with a retractable rear window and an optional rear
spoiler. Both bumpers were refinished and the passenger front fender was
also repainted by the selling dealer due to a scratch, and the work
reportedly included color blending into the passenger-side door. Paint
readings from around the vehicle are available in the gallery below, which
also contains images showing the top both installed and mounted in the
trunk.


Factory 14'' five-spoke wheels are wrapped with Ironman tires. The Si trim
level received four-wheel disc brakes along with front and rear stabilizer
bars. Additional equipment includes a front double-wishbone suspension
system with a trailing arm multilink system in the rear. The brake pads
and rotors were replaced in February 2020, and a fluid flush was also
performed. A spare tire and tool kit are included in the sale.


The black interior features striped cloth seats with color-keyed fabric
inserts. A factory cassette radio is linked with a four-speaker audio
system, and the car is equipped with air conditioning, power windows and
locks, cruise control, and dual SRS airbags.


Instrumentation includes a tachometer with a 7,200-rpm redline, a 130-mph
speedometer, and additional gauges for fuel and coolant temperature. The
six-digit mechanical odometer shows approximately 38k miles.


The 1.6L SOHC D16Z6 inline-four features VTEC variable valve timing and
was factory-rated at 125 horsepower at 6,600 rpm. Service in February 2020
performed by Leading Edge Autosport of West Chester, Pennsylvania included
replacing the timing belt, water pump, muffler, valve cover gasket, and
more as outlined on a receipt provided in the gallery.


Power is supplied to the front wheels through a five-speed manual
transmission, and the seller states that the clutch was replaced just
prior to their acquisition earlier this year. Additional photos of the
underside are available in the gallery below.


The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and displays history
in Delaware through its most recent entry in November 2019.
