This 1981 Buick Regal coupe is finished in white with a white landau top
over tan, and power comes from a 3.8-liter V6 paired with a three-speed
automatic transmission. Equipment includes air conditioning,
chrome-accented wheels, sport mirrors, and a Delco AM/FM stereo. The car
was first delivered to Reese Motors in Mineola, New York, and reportedly
remained with its original owner prior to its recent acquisition by the
selling dealer. This Regal coupe now shows 7k miles and is offered at no
reserve in New York with a build sheet, all-weather floor mats, a clean
Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title.
