This 2007 Bentley Azure convertible was first delivered to Newport Beach
Auto Center in California, and was relocated to Texas prior to its
acquisition by the selling dealer. It is finished in Royal Ebony Metallic
with a dark brown convertible top over dark brown leather, and is powered
by a twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V8 paired with a six-speed automatic
transmission. Features include 19'' chrome-finished wheels, xenon
headlights, heated and power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate
control, parking sensors, and an Alpine stereo. The car now shows 21k
miles, and recent service performed at Bentley Dallas in Texas included
replacement front-upper ball joints, spark plugs, a fuel pressure
transducer, a fuel-rail pressure sensor, and oxygen and exhaust gas
sensors. This Azure is offered with recent service records, a clean Carfax
report, and a clean Texas title.

21k-Mile 2007 Bentley Azure

The body is finished in Royal Ebony Metallic (9560038) with a dark brown
power-operated soft top, which is pictured in both its raised and lowered
position in the gallery. Features include a polished mesh grille, xenon
headlamps, a "Flying B" hood ornament, and dual oval exhaust tips exiting
below the rear bumper. The selling dealer notes that the deck lid appears
to have been repainted.

This is a re-list after the car previously sold on BaT in July 2020 and
the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to
purchase. The winner has been banned from future participation on BaT and
their buyera**s fee was not refunded.


Factory 19'' chrome-finished wheels are wrapped in 255/45 Michelin Pilot
Sport A/S tires. Driver aids include traction control, stability control,
and front and rear parking sensors. The front-upper ball joints were
replaced and a four-wheel alignment was performed in August 2019.


The interior is trimmed in dark brown leather that extends from the
seating surfaces to the dashboard, door panels, and center console. Burl
walnut trim accents are present on the doors, center console, steering
wheel, and dashboard fascia. Other amenities include power-adjustable and
heated front seats with memory settings, as well as a power-adjustable
steering column with memory, tri-zone automatic climate control, and an
Alpine stereo with HD Radio and MP3 compatibility.


The multi-function steering wheel frames a 190-mph speedometer and a
5k-rpm tachometer. Centrally-located ancillary gauges include readouts for
coolant temperature, fuel level, and oil pressure. An ambient temperature
gauge and an analog clock are also fitted in the dashboard, and the
digital odometer shows 21k miles.


The twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V8 was factory rated at 450 horsepower
and 645 lb-ft of torque. Service performed at Bentley Dallas since August
2019 includes replacement spark plugs, air filters, oxygen sensors,
exhaust gas temperature sensors, a fuel pressure transducer, and a fuel
rail pressure sensor.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed ZF automatic
transmission with manual shifting capability. Additional underside photos
are provided in the gallery.


The June 2020 Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage and shows
registration history in California and Texas. A video tour and a soft-top
operation video are provided below.
