1934 Pierce-Arrow 1240A Silver Arrow Coupe

The 1240A was among three Pierce-Arrow models introduced for 1934 that
could be ordered in multiple wheelbases and body styles, as well as with a
straight-eight or V12 power plant. Available with either engine and built
on a 144'' wheelbase, the Silver Arrow Coupe inherited its name from a
concept sedan that Pierce-Arrow had debuted the previous year. Styling
elements include a tapered rear profile, headlights and taillights fared
into the fenders, and a sloped grille.


Following the current owner's acquisition, this example received a repaint
by LaVine Restorations in Nappanee, Indiana, due to the owner's desire for
a color change. The body now wears a black finish with gray accents and
red coachlining along the shoulder lines, sail panels, and lower body. The
finish, trim, and lenses are shown close up in the photo gallery below.
The seller notes that there is a scuff on the right-hand side of the
radiator shell from contact during opening of the hood, and that the
rubber corner guards on the hood panel will need to be re-secured.


Black-painted 17a** steel wheels feature polished covers with a**Pierce
12a** insignias and wear B.F. Goodrich Silvertown whitewall tires. Dual
side-mount spares are encased in body-colored covers that also carry side
mirrors. Braking is handled by mechanical, servo-assisted drums from
Stewart-Warner at all four wheels. An adjustment of the system was
performed in July 2020.


The cabin is upholstered in gray and white patterned cloth over seating
for four. The door panels are are trimmed to match, and gray carpeting
lines the floors. Two different types of wood in contrasting-color stains
accent the doors, dash, and window frames. A period radio is situated in
the glovebox door, though the dial face has faded. A Signal-Stat turn
signal system has been added, with a switch mounted on the steering
column. The throttle position lever on the steering wheel was replaced in
2020.


Instrumentation includes a 100-mph speedometer and a clock, along with
gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, amperage, and coolant temperature.
The five-digit odometer shows 600 miles, and true mileage is unknown.


The 462ci side-valve V12 was introduced by Pierce-Arrow in 1933 with a
factory-rated output of 175 horsepower. Features include hydraulic tappets
and twin downdraft Stromberg carburetors with an automatic choke. A
Startix automatic starting system was also standard equipment, allowing
electric starting in addition to automatic restarting in the event of the
engine stalling. The Startix system was repaired in January 2020.
Maintenance is said to have been addressed in-house during the cara**s
time in the current ownera**s collection.


The three-speed manual transmission features synchromesh on second and
third gears, as well as a free-wheeling unit that enables coasting while
in gear by disengaging the driveshaft from the forces of engine braking.
