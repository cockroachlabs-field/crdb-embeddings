This 2001 BMW M3 coupe is finished in Laguna Seca Blue over Cinnamon Nappa
leather, and power is provided by a 3.2-liter inline-six paired with a
six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip rear differential. The
car was first registered in Florida and was previously featured on BaT in
September 2019 prior to its purchase in 2020 by the seller, who
subsequently added 1k of the 87k miles it now has. Previously installed
modifications were removed, and the car features 19'' Competition Package
staggered-width wheels, Tein lowering springs, and a
European-specification front bumper. Additional equipment includes a
power-operated sunroof, automatic climate control, and navigation, and
service performed during current ownership included an oil change and
replacement of oxygen sensors, oil pan gasket, oil filter housing seal,
the valve cover gasket, power steering pump, starter, and throttle
position sensors. This E46 M3 is now offered with partial service records,
spare parts and accessories, factory literature, an accident-free Carfax
report, and a clean Florida title in the seller's name.

2001 BMW M3 Coupe 6-Speed

The body is finished in Laguna Seca Blue (488) with high-gloss Shadowline
trim, and equipment includes a rear spoiler and a European-specification
front bumper cover. The hood, front fenders, side mirrors, rear quarter
panels, deck lid, and front and rear bumper covers were refinished at ANS
Autowerks of Linden, New Jersey before the previous listing on BaT in
2019. The previously mounted black-finished kidney grilles, CSL-style
trunk lid, aftermarket front lip spoiler, and custom-painted headlights
were removed and replaced with factory-specification parts. A car cover is
included in the sale, a spot of clearcoat failure on the roof is noted,
and additional exterior flaws are shown in the gallery below.


Competition Package 19'' silver-finished wheels were fitted and wear Toyo
Proxes Sport A/S tires measuring 225/40 up front and 255/35 out back. The
previously mounted suspension, wheel, and brake modifications were
removed, and the car rides on Tein lowering springs augmented by an H&R
front sway bar. Braking is handled by black-finished factory-specification
calipers with ventilated rotors, and spare performance brake parts
accompany the sale. Curb marks are visible on the wheels, and service
during current ownership included replacement of the wheel bearings and
the power steering pump and reservoir.


The interior features Cinnamon Nappa leather that was fitted during prior
ownership covering the seating surfaces, door panel inserts, and center
armrest. Piano black trim adorns the dashboard, center console, and door
panels, and additional modifications include manually-adjustable front
seats, an Alcantara shift boot, an Competition-specification emergency
brake handle, and a Turner Motorsport aluminum gas pedal cover. A power
sunroof, automatic climate control, power windows, a navigation system,
and cruise control are also equipped.


A three-spoke M Sport steering wheel frames factory instrumentation
consisting of a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable
redline, along with gauges for fuel level, oil temperature, and coolant
temperature. The digital odometer shows under 87k miles, approximately 1k
of which were added by the seller.


The 3.2-liter inline-six was factory rated at 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft
of torque when new. A previously-installed supercharger kit has been
removed since the car was last featured on BaT in 2019, and maintenance
performed in 2020 included an oil change and replacement of both upstream
oxygen sensors as well as the throttle position potentiometers, oil filter
housing seal, oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, Diagnostic Module Tank
Leakage (DMTL) pump, and the starter. The rod bearings were reportedly
replaced during prior ownership in 2017.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission
and a factory M Variable Lock differential. The rear subframe was
reinforced in 2019 at Autocouture Motoring of Fair Lawn, New Jersey.
Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery.


The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists
registration history in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey. At least one
open recall is shown.
