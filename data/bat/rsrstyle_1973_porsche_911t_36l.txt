This 1973 Porsche 911T was purchased by the seller in 2018 and
subsequently refurbished and modified in the style of an RSR. The exterior
was refinished in its original Viper Green, the interior was reupholstered
and fitted with 911R-style components, and a 993-sourced 3.6L VarioRam
flat-six was installed along with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle and a
limited-slip differential. Additional modifications include a roll bar,
LED lighting, Bilstein shocks, a custom exhaust, Braid 17'' RSR-style
wheels, 996-sourced brake components, sport seats, a MOMO Prototipo
steering wheel, and a 917-style shift knob. This modified 911T is now
offered with a clean Tennessee title in the seller's name.

During the refurbishment, the body was disassembled and media blasted. The
floor pans were undercoated with bed liner, and modified Carrera-sourced
front fenders were fitted, along with frosted aluminum trim, widened rear
fenders, drilled door handles, and a fiberglass ducktail spoiler and
bumper covers. The body was then finished in its original Viper Green
utilizing Glasurit paint, and silver and black Porsche-script side and
rear decals were applied. The headlights were also modified with LED bulbs
in H4 housings with powder-coated trim, and LED driving lights are mounted
behind the horn grilles.


Braid RSR-style 17'' wheels measure 9'' in width up front and 11'' out
back and wear Sumitomo HTR tires measuring 245/45 up front and 315/35 out
back. The seller states that the suspension features Carrera-sourced strut
housings with Bilstein inserts, 20mm front torsion bars, a 22mm sway bar,
and an RSR-style strut bar up front, while out back Carrera-sourced
aluminum trailing arms are paired with Bilstein Sport shocks, a Sway-A-Way
adjustable spring plate system, and 30mm torsion bars. The braking system
reportedly utilizes a 23mm master cylinder and braided stainless-steel
brake lines along with 996-sourced calipers and cross-drilled rotors all
around.


Vintage-style vented sport seats upholstered in saddle are complemented by
a replacement carpet set with matching floor mats trimmed with darker
piping. Matching 911R-style door panels contrast the Ivory-toned headliner
and reupholstered black dashboard that features deviating green stitching.
The rear seat was removed and a roll bar was fitted, along with a MOMO
Prototipo steering wheel and a 917-style wooden shift knob.


Instrumentation backlit with green LED bulbs includes an 8k-rpm
tachometer, a 150-mph speedometer, and a quartet of auxiliary gauges. The
six-digit odometer shows 137k miles, approximately 1k of which were added
by the seller. Total chassis mileage is unknown.


The 3.6-liter VarioRam flat-six was reportedly sourced from a 1998 993 and
fitted by the seller. The ECU features a Rennsport Systems custom tune by
Steve Weiner.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 915 five-speed manual transaxle
and a limited-slip differential. The transaxle was reportedly rebuilt
during the modification process. The exhaust system features modified
993-style headers, a free-flowing muffler system, and a paired-twin
central outlet.
