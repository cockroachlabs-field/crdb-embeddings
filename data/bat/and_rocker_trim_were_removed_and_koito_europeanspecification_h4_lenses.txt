This 1985 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ60 spent time in Oklahoma, Texas, and
Arkansas prior to the seller's 2019 purchase, and has since received
cosmetic refurbishment and mechanical service. The body was repainted in
the original color of Beige Metallic, the air-conditioning system was
refurbished, and the tan and brown interior was fitted with replacement
carpets and an aftermarket stereo. Power from the 4.2-liter 2F inline-six
is sent to all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and
two-speed transfer case. Additional service performed included fluid
flushes, replacement of the carburetor and radiator, rebuilding the front
knuckles, and installation of replacement 30'' BFGoodrich tires. This FJ60
is now offered with an owner's manual, a clean Carfax report, partial
service receipts, a factory tool pouch and bottle jack, and a clean Texas
title in the seller's name.

The five-door wagon body was partially disassembled and door dings
repaired prior to a recent repaint in its factory shade of Beige Metallic
(4E9). The grille and headlight surrounds were replaced, chrome drip rails
and rocker trim were removed, and Koito European-specification H4 lenses
were fitted. Additional equipment includes Thule load bars, mud flaps,
chrome bumpers, and a trailer hitch receiver. Photos showing the paintwork
in progress and close-ups of the resulting finish can be viewed in the
