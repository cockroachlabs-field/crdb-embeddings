This 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra was first delivered to Murphy Ford of
Morton, Illinois, and reportedly remained with its original owner prior to
its acquisition by the selling dealer in 2017. The car now shows just
under 8k miles and is finished in Black Clearcoat over Opal Grey leather,
and power is supplied by a 5.0-liter V8 paired with a five-speed manual
transmission. The car is modified with 3.73 gears and a MAC Performance
exhaust system with equal-length headers, and amenities include air
conditioning, power-adjustable front sport seats, a CD stereo, and
upgraded suspension and four-wheel disc brakes. This Cobra is now being
offered by the selling dealer in Quebec, Canada with partial service
records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and clean Quebec
registration.

8k-Mile 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra

The SVT Cobra was fitted with a larger rear spoiler along with unique
badging and bumper covers that differentiated it from a standard Mustang
GT. This example is one of 1,854 produced in Black Clearcoat (UA), and
factory equipment includes a sunroof delete along with integrated front
fog lights and dual exhaust outlets.


Cobra-specific 17a** alloy wheels are wrapped in 245/45 Continental
ExtremeContact DWS06 tires. Further SVT modifications include
custom-valved Tokico struts and shock absorbers along with upgraded
springs and sway bars, as well as larger vented brake rotors at each
corner.


The interior features seats trimmed in Opal Grey leather, along with
matching door panels and carpeting lined with Cobra-branded mats.
Amenities include front sport seats with power-adjustable lumbar support,
air conditioning, an AM/FM/CD stereo, and power locks, mirrors, and
windows. An aftermarket shift knob has been added.


The four-spokeA  leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 140-mph
speedometer and a 7k-rpm tachometer, as well as gauges for battery charge,
coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit
mechanical odometer shows under 8k miles, approximately 1k of which were
added by the selling dealer .


The 5.0-liter OHV V8 features a Cobra intake manifold along with hydraulic
roller lifters and GT-40 cylinder heads, and it was factory rated at 235
horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels
through a five-speed manual gearbox, and modifications reportedly include
3.73 gears and MAC Performance equal-length headers with an H-pipe exhaust
and turbo mufflers.
