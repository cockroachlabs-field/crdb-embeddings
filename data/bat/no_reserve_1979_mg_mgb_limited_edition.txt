This 1979 MGB is a Limited Edition roadster that was reportedly sold new
in California and remained in-state until being acquired by the seller in
July 2015 and relocated to Idaho. The odometer shows 14k miles, and the
car is one of 6,668 Limited Edition examples produced between 1979 and
1980, all of which were finished in black with silver side stripes and
featured five-spoke alloy wheels, a front air dam, and a decklid luggage
rack. Power is provided by a 1.8-liter inline-four mated to a four-speed
manual gearbox with overdrive, and work performed during current ownership
is said to have included overhauls of the carburetor and brakes, fluid
changes, and the installation of an electronic ignition system. This MGB
LE is now offered at no reserve with a tonneau cover, factory literature,
and a clean Idaho title in the seller's name.

No Reserve: 1979 MG MGB Limited Edition

All Limited Edition examples were finished in black and came equipped with
black rubber bumpers, a front air dam, a chrome luggage rack, and silver
MGB side stripes. The paintwork can be viewed close-up in the gallery
below.


Factory 14a*^3 five-spoke GKN alloy wheels were specific to Limited
Edition models and wear Hercules Tour 4.0 Plus tires that were installed
during current ownership. The car was reportedly stored between 1990 and
2015, and work performed by the seller in 2015 to return it to the road is
said to have included a brake fluid flush, a rebuild of the brake master
cylinder, and the installation of replacement rear wheel cylinders, brake
hoses, and brake lines.


The interior is trimmed in black basketweave vinyl upholstery with
matching door panels and carpeting. A Blaupunkt AM/FM radio is retained in
the dash, and a plaque on the glove box identifies the car as a Limited
Edition model. A top boot and tonneau cover are included in the sale.


The LE-specific leather-wrapped MG steering wheel fronts a 7k-rpm
tachometer, an 85-mph speedometer, and gauges for fuel level, oil
pressure, voltage, and water temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 14k
miles, approximately 600 of which were added by the seller.


The 1,798cc inline-four produced 62 horsepower and 88 lb-ft of torque when
new and drives the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission
with overdrive. Work performed during current ownership reportedly
included rebuilding the clutch cylinder, a carburetor overhaul, fluid
changes for the transmission and differential, and the installation of an
electronic ignition system and a replacement battery.
