No Reserve: 1987 Toyota Supra

The car is finished in Dark Blue Pearl (8E3) and features integrated front
fog lights, a rear wiper, and pop-up headlights, the latter of which can
be seen in their raised position in the gallery. No accidents are noted on
the accompanying Carfax report, and paint chips on the hood and roof are
shown up close in the image gallery below.


Factory 16a*^3 directional alloy wheels wear 205/55 Toyo Extensa A/S tires
with 2013 date codes. The car is fitted with Bilstein shocks.


The interior is trimmed in Dark Blue cloth (FD82) with matching carpets,
door panels, and dashboard plastics. Amenities include automatic climate
control, cruise control, a cassette stereo, and power windows and locks.


Instrumentation includes a 150-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer,
along with gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and
voltage. The six-digit odometer shows just under 74k miles, less than 100
of which were added by the selling dealer.


The naturally-aspirated 3.0L 7M-GE inline-six was factory rated at 200
horsepower, and power is sent to the rear wheels through an A340E
four-speed automatic transmission. According to the selling dealer, the
accessory belt, tensioner, and alternator were recently replaced, and the
air conditioning has been converted to run on R134a refrigerant.

The August 2020 Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists
registration history in New York beginning in October 1992. The car is
supplied with three keys and an owner's manual, and a walk-around video is
