This 1966 Ford Mustang convertible was purchased by the seller's brother
in the 1980s and acquired by the seller in 2014. Powered by a 289ci V8
paired with a three-speed C4 automatic transmission, the car is finished
in blue over two-tone blue vinyl, and other features include a white soft
top, a vinyl boot cover, 14a*^3 wheels with simulated wire covers, and a
four-barrel Holley carburetor. This Mustang convertible is now offered
with service records dating back to the 1980s and a clean New Hampshire
transferrable registration.

The car was finished in Tahoe Turquoise Metallic (U) from the factory, and
it reportedly was refinished prior to the seller's brother's acquisition
in the 1980s. Paint and bodywork was carried out in July 1992 that
included repairing rust in both rear quarter panels, as well as performing
paintwork around the fuel-filler area and touching up chips on the doors.
An invoice for the work by Classic Restorations Unlimited of Manchester,
New Hampshire is shown in the photo gallery below along with several
current paint blemishes.


14'' wheels wear simulated wire covers and are mounted with 195/75 Hankook
Optimo H724 whitewall tires. The front and rear shocks were replaced along
with the left rear wheel cylinder in July 2018, at which time the brake
fluid was flushed.


The cabin was upholstered from the factory in two-tone Light Aqua and
Medium Aqua Rosette vinyl (27). Interior surfaces exhibit wear including a
hole in the driver seat bottom, which is shown with and without tape in
the photo gallery.


A three-spoke steering wheel is cracked along the rim and frames
instrumentation that consists of a 140-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel
level, oil pressure, amperage, and coolant temperature. The five-digit
odometer shows 7k miles, approximately 6k of which are said to have been
added by the seller. True mileage is unknown.


The C-code 289ci V8 is equipped with a chrome air-cleaner housing and a
Holley four-barrel carburetor that was installed two years ago. The engine
oil was changed in preparation for the sale.


Power is sent to the rear wheels through a C4 three-speed automatic
transmission and a 2.80:1 rear end. The transmission tail-shaft seal was
replaced in September 2017, as was a rear U-joint. Additional photos of
the underside are presented in the gallery.
