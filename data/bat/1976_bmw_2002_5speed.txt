The 1976 BMW 2002 is a square-taillight example that was acquired four
years ago by the seller, who subsequently performed a cosmetic
refurbishment. The car was refinished in Mint Green, the tan interior was
reupholstered, the 14'' alloy wheels were refinished, and seals, trim, and
glass were replaced. Power is provided by a 2.0-liter inline-four paired
with a five-speed manual transmission and limited-slip differential, and
additional equipment includes a sunroof, Bilstein shocks, a wood-rimmed
steering wheel, and an Alpine stereo. This 2002 is now offered with
service records, spare parts, and a clean California title in the seller's
name.

The seller refinished the car in January 2017 in its factory shade of Mint
Green (079) after installing replacement metal in the spare tire well. In
2018 the windshield, rear glass, and front and rear window chrome trim was
replaced, along with the hood and trunk seals. In 2019 the exterior trim
was polished and anodized, and the exterior light wiring was repaired.
Dents on the left-front door bottom and fender bottom are shown in the
gallery below.


E30-sourced 14a*^3 bottlecap alloy wheels were refinished and mounted with
195/60 Toyo Extensa A/S tires in July 2018. The suspension is fitted with
Bilstein shocks, and braking is handled by front discs and green-finished
rear drums.


The cabin features front bucket and rear bench seats that were
reupholstered in tan vinyl in 2018, and the headliner was also replaced.
Additional modifications include a wood-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel,
an Alpine stereo with Bluetooth compatibility, and Coco floor mats. During
refurbishment, the sunroof handle cup was replaced, the rear defroster and
interior lights were repaired, and the trunk interior was refreshed.
Cracks are visible on the dash, the leather wrap on the shift knob is
torn, and the cigarette lighter does not function. An uninstalled dash cap
and older Blaupunkt radio are included in the sale.


The woodgrain fascia contains instruments including a 120-mph speedometer,
a tachometer with a 6,400-rpm redline, and a combination gauge with
temperature and fuel-level readouts. The five-digit mechanical odometer
indicates under 2k miles, with total mileage unknown. The seller states
that the speedometer back-lighting does not work.


The 2.0-liter M10 inline-four sends power to the rear wheels through a
replacement five-speed manual transmission that was installed by Catalpa
Street Garage of Santa Cruz, California in 2000. A limited-slip
differential was fitted in 2006, and the seller reports the clutch master
cylinder was replaced and a K&N air filter was fitted in 2018. Additional
work included replacement of the windshield washer fluid tank, fuse box
cover, and fuel-filler hose.


The aftermarket exhaust system was repaired in November 2019 prior to a
California Smog test. Additional photos of the underside and suspension
are viewable below.
