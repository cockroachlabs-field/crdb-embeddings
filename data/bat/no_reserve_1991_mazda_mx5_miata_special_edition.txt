No Reserve: 1991 Mazda MX-5 Miata Special Edition

British Racing Green paint was unique to the Special Edition Miata, and
this example wears a sticker from the original dealer in North Carolina.
Dents at the right front have been touched up with non-matching paint, and
a scratch is present on the rear bumper cover. Additional blemishes
detailed in the photo gallery below, and aA walk-around video has been
provided by the seller.


A matching boot covers the tan soft top, which is shown raised in the
gallery and shows two tears as well as a rip on the inside near the
zipper. Factory 14'' wheels wear Ironman 185/60 tires. An alignment and
tire rotation were performed in January 2020 along with replacement of the
sway bar bushings.


The interior is upholstered in tan leather with matching floor mats and
carpets. A wood Nardi shift knob and emergency brake handle were included
as part of the Special Edition package, as was air conditioning.
Temperature readings at the vents are shown in the gallery. The seller
notes wear on the outer driver's seat bolster, and the gauge cluster hood
was replaced due to overspray from the previous owner's attempt to paint
the dash.


The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 54k miles. An expandable cupholder
from the Miata Products Registry was purchased by the original owner in
1993 and will be included in the sale.A The airbag module was replaced in
January 2020 to correct an intermittent warning light. An aftermarket Sony
stereo is linked to stockA headrest speakers, distortion from the left of
which is noted at higher volumes. A video overview of the interior is
availableA here.


Output from the 1.6-liter dual overhead-cam four was rated at 116
horsepower with 100 lb-ft of torque from the factory, and power is sent to
the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The valve cover
gasket was replaced and the oil changed in January 2020 at 54k miles. The
seller notes sagging of the under-tray as well as a noise suspected to be
the throwout bearing that occurs when the car is warmed up and in neutral.
A Battery Tender will be included in the sale.


The factory hardtop was a $1,400 option when new. Additional photos of its
body-colored finish, weatherstripping, and latches are presented in the
gallery below. The hardtop stand is not included in the sale.


The window sticker lists Special Edition features for an MSRP of just
under $21k. A dealer markup form, plastic credit card key, manuals, and
Special Edition-specific literature are also included in the sale along
with factory tools and an unopened set of wheel locks.


The May 2020 Carfax report shows North Carolina ownership history until
early 2015, at which point the car was titled in Florida. Interior,
walk-around, and driving videos are provided below, with additional
footage available on the seller's YouTube channel. Photos beyond what's
