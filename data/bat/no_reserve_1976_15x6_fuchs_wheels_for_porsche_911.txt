These 15a** Fuchs wheels measure 6a** in width and were manufactured in
April 1976. They were refinished at some point in the past and feature
polished spokes, lips, and center caps, along with recessed areas painted
black. Stampings and casting marks on the inside of the spokes show dates
of manufacture, part numbers, dimensions, and Fuchs emblems. The wheels
were recently removed from a 1970 911T and are wrapped with Pirelli P6000
tires. This set of four 15a*^3 Fuchs wheels is now offered at no reserve
out of Pinehurst, North Carolina.

No Reserve: 1976 15x6" Fuchs Wheels for Porsche 911

All four forged alloy wheels measure 15a** in diameter and 6a** in width.
Each features a 36mm offset and polished lips and spokes, as well as
black-painted recessed areas. The wheels are mounted with a matching set
of 195/65 Pirelli P6000 tires showing 2015 date codes. Four center caps
are included.


Each wheel is stamped with Porsche part number 911.361.020.10. The Fuchs
fox head logo is present under the part number stamps.


Date stampings indicate production in April 1976, and photos displaying
the back of each wheel are provided in the gallery. The wheels were
recently removed from a 1970 911T and are shown still mounted on the car
in the gallery, as well as in the video attached below.
