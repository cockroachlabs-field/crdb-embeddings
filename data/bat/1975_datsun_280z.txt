This 1975 Datsun 280Z was originally purchased from Fairfield Datsun in
California, and it is said to have remained within the state from new. The
car is finished in silver over black vinyl, and power is provided by a
2.8-liter inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission.
Equipment includes aftermarket 14'' polished alloy wheels, a Pioneer
cassette stereo, and chrome bumpers. The seller purchased the car in 2018
from its prior owner of 42 years, and recent service included an oil
change and replacement of the oil pan gasket, water pump, door seals, and
mustache bar bushings. This 280Z is now offered with factory literature,
service records dating to the 1970s, a factory toolkit, assorted spare
parts, and a clean California title in the seller's name.

The exterior of the car was reportedly refinished in its factory Silver
Metallic (901) during prior ownership. Equipment includes a body-color
left-side mirror, a powered antenna, chrome window trim, and
chrome-finished bumpers. Recent service included replacement of the door
seals, and close up photos of the bodywork, glass, trim, and lenses are
provided in the gallery below.


Polished 14'' slotted alloy wheels are wrapped in 235/60 Goodyear Eagle
VR60 tires. During prior ownership in 2013 the brake system was
overhauled, including replacement of the front brake calipers, front brake
lines, rear wheel cylinders, rear brake hoses, machining the front rotors,
and servicing the rear drums. Recent service included replacement of the
mustache bar bushings.


The interior features seats upholstered in black vinyl, along with
replacement black carpeting and a matching black dashboard and door
panels. Amenities include a rear window defroster and a Pioneer cassette
deck. A crack is visible in the dashboard above the center auxiliary
gauges, and the clock does not work. Photos of the floor pans with the
carpeting removed are provided in the gallery below.


The factory three-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer and an
8k-rpm tachometer. The five-digit odometer is said to have rolled over and
indicates just under 43k miles, approximately 250 of which were added by
the seller.


The 2.8-liter L28E inline-six features Bosch fuel injection, and it
produced 170 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque when new. Remanufactured
fuel injectors and a replacement fuel pump were fitted in September 2014,
and recent service reportedly included an oil change and replacement of
the oil pan gasket and water pump.


Engine block stamping 021200 is shown above and matches the engine number
stamping on the data plate shown in the gallery below.


Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual gearbox.
Additional photos of the underside, brake, suspension, and exhaust
components can be viewed in the gallery. A 280ZX close-ratio five-speed
manual transmission and rebuilt Futofab Subaru WRX STi conversion stub
axles are also included in the sale.


A stamped service booklet and owner's manual are included in the sale,
along with service records dating to the 1970s. The seller has also
provided a service summary timeline that chronicles ownership and
maintenance history, which is shown in the gallery below.
