This 2005 Porsche 911 Turbo S is one of 186 coupes produced for North
America, and it was purchased new in California by the current owner. It
is finished in Atlas Gray Metallic over Graphite Gray full leather, and
power is provided by a twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six paired with a
six-speed manual transaxle and all-wheel drive. Equipment includes 18''
Turbo Twist wheels, Porsche Carbon Composite Brakes, a speed-activated
rear spoiler, automatic climate control, and a double-DIN Pioneer
touchscreen stereo. This 996 Turbo S has under 12k miles and is now
offered with a DME report, custom seat covers, a clean Carfax report, and
a clean California title in the owner's name.

12k-Mile 2005 Porsche 911 Turbo S Coupe 6-Speed

The car is finished in Atlas Gray Metallic (LM7X), and equipment include
rear quarter air inlets, polished exhaust tips, and a speed-activated rear
spoiler. The included Carfax report shows no history of accidents or other
damage, and close-up photos of the finish and lenses are provided in the
gallery.


Factory 18'' Turbo Twist wheels feature colored Porsche-crest center caps
and are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza S-02A tires, which measure 225/40
up front and 295/30 out back. Standard equipment on the Turbo S models
includes Porsche Carbon Composite Brakes (PCCB), which are identifiable by
yellow-finished six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers.


The cabin features seats upholstered in Graphite Gray full leather (CZ)
that extends to the dashboard and door panel inserts, color-matching
carpets protected by 996 Turbo S-logo floor mats, aluminum inlays in the
shift knob and emergency brake lever, and a Porsche Exclusive center
console in the exterior color. The front seats are power-adjustable and
are embossed with Porsche crests in the headrests, and additional
amenities include automatic climate control, cruise control, and a Pioneer
double DIN touchscreen stereo with a Bose sound system. The seller reports
that custom front seat covers with contrasting piping were fitted when
new, and they are included in the sale.


The leather wrapped three-spoke steering wheel frames a suite of
aluminum-look instrumentation, including a central 8k-rpm tachometer and a
200-mph speedometer. Under 12k miles are shown on the digital odometer.


Power is provided by a twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six, and the Turbo S
added the X50 performance package with larger turbochargers and
intercoolers from the contemporary 996 GT2, as well as revised ECU
programing. Factory-rated output was 450 horsepower with a matching torque
figure. An included DME report is provided in the gallery below and shows
zero overrevs in range 2, indicating that the engine has not exceeded the
rev limiter.


Additional photos of the underside are provided in the image gallery and
show the drivetrain components, protective trays, and floors, as well as
scuffs on the underside of the front valance.


The underhood option code sticker decodes the following information:

* LM7X - Atlas Gray Metallic
* CZ - Graphite Gray Full Leather
* XCZ - Short shifter
* XME - Center console finished in exterior color
* XSC - Porsche crest embossed in headrests
* X97 - Shift knob with aluminum inlay
* X98 - Emergency brake handle with aluminum inlay
* 709 - Internal production code


The August 2020 Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage and shows
registration history in California through its most recent entry in
January 2020. The seller states that the current owner is both the first
and second reported owner, which resulted from re-titling the car from his
trust to his name.
