L’Ardente, 200 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington DC (Capitol Crossing, between Union Station and Chinatown)

Chef David Deshaies (also of Unconventional Diner) trained under the late-great Michel Richard at Citronelle, so it’s no surprise that the dishes he puts out will be beautifully-executed and often contain a touch of whimsy. But don’t let the whimsy fool you. These are serious dishes that have the confidence not to take themselves too seriously. Some of them you may know from social media — the 40-layer lasagna may be DC’s most Instagrammed dish ever — but they taste as good as they look. By the way, unlike many top restaurants, L’Ardente is also great lunch spot. My go-to is one of the excellent salads or maybe a pasta, and then casually ask my table-mates if we should order a funghi pizza for the table. I don’t expressly say that my day will be ruined if they say no, but maybe they can sense it. So far no one’s said no.
