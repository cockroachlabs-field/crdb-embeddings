This 1983 Ferrari 512 BBi is one of 1,007 fuel-injected examples produced during a four-year production run and was imported and federalized by Grande Auto Imports in June 1983 prior to being sold new through La Jolla Ferrari later that year. Chassis 47871 subsequently spent time under the ownership of late-night television host David Letterman before being acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. The car is finished in Rosso Corsa and features a black high-mount rear spoiler and engine lid grilles along with pop-up headlights, fog lights, and NACA side ducts. Inside, Daytona-style seats are trimmed in beige leather and accompanied by a Nardi steering wheel, Veglia instrumentation, and a gated dogleg shifter as well as a Pioneer AM/FM cassette stereo paired and dash-mounted graphic equalizer. Power is provided by a 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 mated to a five-speed manual transaxle, and further equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a fully independent suspension, and center-lock 415mm five-spoke alloy wheels. A major service was performed and the shocks were rebuilt under current ownership in April 2024. This 512 BBi is now offered by the selling dealer in Scottsdale, Arizona, with manufacturerâ€™s literature, service records, a tool kit, a jack kit, and a clean Oklahoma title.
