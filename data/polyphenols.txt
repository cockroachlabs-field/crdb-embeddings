Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and other plant foods, like nuts and legumes, are rich in polyphenols — antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds that some research suggests can support healthy aging.

Coffee, for example, is a major source of polyphenols. Drinking as much as three to five cups per day has been linked with reduced risks for Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, Parkinson’s disease, cognitive decline and earlier death, Dr. Hu said. Green tea may have similar benefits, he added, though the research is less robust.

Researchers have also linked other polyphenol-rich foods like berries, dark leafy green vegetables, avocados and extra virgin olive oil to health benefits, including a longer life and improved brain health.
