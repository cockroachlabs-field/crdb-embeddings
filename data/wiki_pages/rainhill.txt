The population at the United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census was 10,853. Historically part of Lancashire, Rainhill was a Township (England)|township in the ecclesiastical parish of Prescot and West Derby (hundred)|hundred of West Derby. Following the Local Government Act 1894, it became part of the Whiston Rural District. The Rainhill Trials of 1829 resulted in the selection of Stephenson's Rocket|Stephenson's "Rocket" as the world's first modern steam locomotive. ==History==  Rainhill has been recorded since Norman times but its name is believed to come from the Old English personal name of Regna or Regan. It is thought that around the time of the Domesday Book that Rainhill was a part of one of the townships within the "Widnes fee". Recordings have shown that in the year of 1246, Roger of Rainhill died and the township was divided into two-halves for each of his daughters. One half was centred on the now standing Rainhill Manor public house, see Rainhill Stoops below, and the other centred on Rainhill Hall, just off Blundell's Lane.  Towards the end of the 18th century, four Catholic sons of a farmer, who came from the area around Stonyhurst, decided to seek their fortunes in Liverpool. The names of the brothers were Joseph, Francis, Peter and Bartholomew Bretherton. In 1800, Bartholomew decided to break into the coaching business. The partnership that he had with one or two of his brothers quickly built up and by 1820, he had the bulk of the coaching trade of Liverpool. He was running coaches to and from Manchester fourteen times a day from the Saracen's Head in Dale Street, Liverpool. Bartholomew chose Rainhill as his first stage and he developed facilities on the land alongside the Ship Inn (originally the New Inn by Henry Parr 1780) and on this site he was believed to be stabling at least 240 horses, coach horses, farriers, coach builders and veterinaries. Bartholomew had begun to purchase land in Rainhill, and in 1824, he bought the Manor of Rainhill from Dr James Gerrard of Liverpool. By 1830, he owned over  around Rainhill. In 1824, across the road from the stables, he built Rainhill House and laid out beautiful gardens around it. Between 1923 and 2014 the house was known as Loyola Hall, serving as a retreat centre run by the Society of Jesus. Since 2017 it has reverted to Rainhill Hall and is a wedding venue.https://www.signatureliving.co.uk/woodland-wedding-venue  During the Victorian era, Rainhill was the location of a notorious mass murderer; Frederick Bailey Deeming. In March 1892, the bodies of a woman and her four children were discovered buried under the concrete floor of Dinham Villa, Lawton Road, Rainhill. File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|The preserved "Rocket" Rainhill was the site of the 1829 Rainhill Trials, in which a number of railway locomotives were entered in a competition to decide a suitable design for use on the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The winner was the Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket, designed by George Stephenson. In 1979 the 150th anniversary of the trials was celebrated by a cavalcade of trains through the ages, including replicas of the winner and runner-up in the trials. ==Geography== The village of Rainhill lies  east of Prescot,  south-southwest of St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens,  east-northeast of Huyton and  east of Liverpool City Centre.   The most southerly area of Rainhill is known as Rainhill Stoops . The name of junction 7 of the M62 motorway  and the A570 is known as "Rainhill Stoops". Warrington Road was a prominent road as a route between the larger settlements of Liverpool, Prescot and Warrington with Rainhill on route. The stoops (a historic marker, waypost or similar guide) existed along the road at key positions. With the establishment in 1753 of the Liverpool to Prescot turnpike, and its subsequent extension to Rainhill and then on to Warrington, a system of toll bars were installed with one such barrier at the stoops. ==Landmarks==  File:Rainhill Bridge, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 3408.jpg|thumb|right|Skew Bridge. Coloured engraving from 1831 File:Stephensonbridge1.jpg|thumb|Skew Bridge as seen today. Rainhill has several churches including: St Ann's, St Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill|St Bartholomew's and St James' – which are Church of England, Roman Catholic and Methodist, respectively. There is also an evangelical church. St Ann's well, a medieval stone lined structure is on the border with Sutton. A feature of the village is the George Stephenson George Stephenson#Stephenson's skew arch bridge|Skew Bridge, a skew arch bridge of sandstone construction that carries the main road over the railway. It takes its name from the unusual diagonal angle at which the railway passes under the bridge. It is the world's first bridge to cross over a railway at an angle. The bridge was later widened to accommodate increases in road traffic. The milestone on the bridge that informs travellers of the distances to Warrington, Prescot and Liverpool was moved to the opposite side at the time of the expansion. Therefore, the distance markers pointed to the wrong destinations. This quirk was corrected in 2005 when the milestone was returned to the correct side of the bridge. ==Economy== Rainhill is now primarily a commuter village, mainly for workers in Liverpool but also St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens and Widnes. Housing on the southerly side of Rainhill is a mixture of semi-detached and detached dwellings, whereas homes to the north, across the Skew Bridge there is a more varied mixture of housing with examples of terraced with semi-detached as well as bungalows. Rainhill as a whole has a mixture of modern, inter-war and Victorian dwellings. Rainhill has several medical centres but the largest and most notable is Scott Clinic which once treated Michael Abram after he was convicted of stabbing The Beatles|Beatles member George Harrison. Rainhill was also home to Rainhill Hospital at one time the largest mental health asylum in the world; which, in December 1911, housed 1,990 patients. This was demolished in 1991. Its former site is now a housing estate as well as accommodating Reeve Court, an extra-care housing project for older people. ==Transport== Rainhill railway station is situated on the City Line (Merseyrail)|Liverpool City Line, between the railway stations of Whiston railway station|Whiston and Lea Green railway station|Lea Green.
