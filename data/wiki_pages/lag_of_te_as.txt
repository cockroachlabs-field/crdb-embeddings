It is well known for its prominent single white star which gives the flag its commonly-used name: "Lone Star Flag". This lone star, in turn, gives rise to the state's nickname: "The Lone Star State". The flag, flown at homes and businesses statewide, is highly popular among Texans and is treated with a great degree of reverence and esteem within Texas. Along with the flag of Hawaii, it is one of two state flags to have previously served as a national flag of an independent country. In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the Texas flag second, behind Flag of New Mexico|New Mexico. ==Flag design== The state flag is officially described by law as: |sign=|source=}} ==History and adoption== File:TexasFlagHoustonShipChannelTourBoat02Apr16.jpg|thumb|Lone Star Flag, flying on the Houston Ship Channel tour boat, on April 2, 2016 Legislation authorizing the flag was introduced in the Congress of the Republic of Texas on December 28, 1838, by Senator William H. Wharton. The flag was adopted on January 25, 1839, as the national flag of the Republic of Texas. "Accompanying the original Act ... is a drawing by Peter Krag of the national flag and seal ... although in the original President Lamar's approval and signature are at the top and upside down" Charles A. Spain Jr.  """ South Tex. Law Rev. 33 (1992): pp. 215-259. When Texas became the 28th United States|U.S. state on December 29, 1845, the national flag became the Flags of the U.S. states|state flag. From 1879 until 1933 there was no official state flag, although the Lone Star Flag remained the de facto state flag; in adopting the Revised Civil Statutes of 1879, the Legislature repealed all statutes not expressly continued in force; since the statutes pertaining to the flag were not among those renewed, Texas was formally flagless until the passage of the 1933 flag law. The actual designer of the flag is unknown.  Some claim that Dr. Charles B. Stewart of Montgomery, Texas#Birthplace of the Lone Star Flag?|Montgomery, Texas, is either the designer of the flag or drew the image used by the Third Congress when enacting the legislation adopting the flag. However, Stewart's drawing "looks suspiciously like a tracing of the Peter Krag art, including the upside down signature of President Lamar". &nbsp; ==Colors and symbolism== The exact shades of red, white, and blue to be used in the flag are specified by Texas statute to be the same as those of the flag of the United States, which are: {| class="wikitable" |- !

The code also states that the single ("lone") star "represents ALL of Texas and stands for our unity as one for God, State, and Country". The idea of the single red stripe and single white stripe actually dates back to the short-lived Republic of Fredonia, a small state near modern Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches which seceded from Mexico in 1826 before being forcibly re-integrated. The new state was formed through an alliance between local English American|Anglo settlers and Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American tribes and the Fredonian flag used a white and red stripe to symbolize the two ethnic/racial groups from which the state was formed. Though this rebellion ultimately failed it served as an inspiration to the later Texas Revolution. The idea of the "lone star" is, in fact, an older symbol predating the flag which was used to symbolize Texans' solidarity in declaring independence from Mexico.  A similar lone star was on the "Burnet Flag", which resembled the flag of the short-lived Republic of West Florida. The "Lone Star" is still seen today as a symbol of Texas' independent spirit, and gave rise to the state's official nickname "The Lone Star State". ==Pledge of allegiance and flag protocol== File:Flag of Texas (proper vertical display).svg|thumb|right|upright|Proper vertical display of the Texas flag The pledge of allegiance to the state flag is as follows: }} The pledge was instituted by the Texas Legislature in 1933. The pledge originally referred to the "Texas flag of 1836" (which was the Burnet Flag, and not the Lone Star Flag then in use).  In 1965, the error was corrected by deleting the words "of 1836" because the current flag was not officially adopted by the Texas government until 1839.  In 2007, the phrase "one state under God" was added. The addition of "under God" has been challenged in court, though an injunction was denied.David Wallace Croft, . As of 2001 (amended 2017), the pledge is recited standing at attention with one's right hand over one's heart. A person in uniform instead renders a military salute.  The Texas Pledge is always recited after reciting Pledge of Allegiance|the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag every morning in the majority of schools across the state. The flag is required by law to be displayed on or near the main administration building of each state institution during each state or national holiday, and on any special occasion of historical significance, permanently above both doors of the Texas State Capitol, alone at the north door, and under the U.S. flag at the south door, with the exception being if the flags are at half mast or if the POW/MIA flag is being flown with the U.S. flag; in which event the Texas flag shall only fly at the North Door.  State law also requires that the state flag be flown at or near any International Port of Entry. When displayed vertically, the blue stripe should be at top and, from the perspective of an observer, the white stripe should be to the left of the red stripe. ==Historical flags of Texas==   <gallery> File:Pavillon royal de France.svg|1685–1689 <br> French flag possibly used by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, during the French colonization of Texas File:Flag of New Spain.svg|1689–1785 <br> State flag and ensign of New Spain, also known as the Cross of Burgundy flag  File:Flag of Spain (1785-1873 and 1875-1931).svg|1785–1821 <br> Spanish Flag of Spain#The origins of the present ensign: Charles III|state flag on land  File:Magee-Gutierrez Coup d'état Flag.svg|1812–1813 <br> The flag of the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition, sometimes called the "first Republic of Texas", which encompassed land from San Antonio to Nacogdoches and Goliad.
