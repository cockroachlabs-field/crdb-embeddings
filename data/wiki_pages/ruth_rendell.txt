Rendell is best known for creating Chief Inspector Wexford.The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Sixth edition. Ed. by Margaret Drabble. Oxford University Press,  2000, p. 847. . A second string of works was a series of unrelated crime novels that explored the psychological background of criminals and their victims. This theme was developed further in a third series of novels, published under the pseudonym "Barbara Vine". ==Life== Rendell was born as Ruth Barbara Grasemann in 1930, in South Woodford, Essex (now Greater London). Her parents were teachers. Her mother, Ebba Kruse, was born in Sweden to Danish parents and brought up in Denmark; her father, Arthur Grasemann, was English. As a result of spending Christmas and other holidays in Scandinavia, Rendell learned Swedish and Danish.  Rendell was educated at the County High School for Girls in Loughton, Essex, the town to which the family moved during her childhood. After high school, she became a feature writer for her local Essex paper, the "Chigwell Times". <!--comment out unsupported claim Even at an early age, making up stories was irresistible to Rendell. As a reporter, she visited a house rumoured to be haunted and invented the ghost of an old woman. The owners threatened to sue the newspaper for devaluing their homes. Later, she reported on the local tennis club's annual dinner without attending, missing the untimely death of the public speaking|after-dinner speaker in mid-speech. She resigned before she could be fired. --> However, she was forced to resign after filing a story about a local sports club dinner she hadn't attended and failing to report that the after-dinner speaker had died midway through the speech. Rendell met her husband Don Rendell when she was working as a newswriter. They married when she was 20, and in 1953 had a son, Simon, now a psychiatric social worker who lives in the U.S. state of Colorado. The couple divorced in 1975 but remarried two years later.  Don Rendell died in 1999 from prostate cancer. She made the county of Suffolk her home for many years, using the settings in several of her novels. She lived in the villages of Polstead and later Groton, Suffolk|Groton, both east of Sudbury, Suffolk|Sudbury. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours and a life peer as "Baroness Rendell of Babergh", of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk, on 24 October 1997. She sat in the House of Lords for the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party. In 1998 Rendell was named on a list of the party's biggest private financial donors. She introduced into the Lords the bill that would later become the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (the intent was to prevent the practice). In August 2014, Rendell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to "The Guardian" expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's 2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue. Rendell was Vegetarianism|vegetarian who was described as living mostly on fruit.. thetimes.co.uk. Retrieved 22 February 2023. She described herself as "slightly agoraphobic" and slept in a specially made four-poster bed because "I like to feel enclosed." ==Awards== Baroness Rendell's awards include the Silver, Gold Dagger|Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers' Association, three Edgar Award|Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award. A number of her works (see the section below) have been adapted for film or television. IMDbThe Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Literature.  Helicon Publishing, 2006. She was also a patron of the charity Kids for Kids which helps children in rural areas of Darfur. There is a blue plaque on one of her homes, 45 Millsmead Way, in Loughton. This was unveiled by her son Simon on 24 February 2016.  Four of her novels appear on the British-based Crime Writers Association Poll (1990) of the best crime fiction novels ever written: two under the Rendell name and two under her pen name of Barbara Vine. ==Death== Rendell had a stroke on 7 January 2015 and died on 2 May 2015.  The Ruth Rendell award was introduced in 2016 by the National Literacy Trust. It is awarded to authors for their work in inspiring children and improving their literacy. ==Developing the thriller genre== Rendell wrote two unpublished novels before the 1964 publication of "From Doon with Death", which was purchased for £75 by John Long; it was the first mystery to feature Inspector Wexford|Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford. Rendell said that the character of Wexford was based on herself. "The Monster in the Box", released in October 2009, was widely suggested to be Wexford's last case. This was incorrect; however it was the final novel featuring Wexford as an employed policeman. In the two following novels, "The Vault (novel)|The Vault" and "No Man's Nightingale," he was retired but was still involved in police investigations as a "consultant". In "Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford" by Daniel Mallory he says (based on a 1990 interview with Rendell by Marilyn Stasio) that Rendell refers to "the hated Agatha" (Christie) and "that awful Marple woman"; and says of St. Mary Mead that she "can hardly bear to say the name of that village" where "one finds a lot of normal, law-abiding people living ordinary, blameless lives, who suddenly decide to murder their aunt. Well, I don’t believe that."  ("Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford" by Daniel Mallory; from 1990 Rendell interview with Marilyn Stasio)  In addition to these police procedurals starring Wexford, Rendell wrote psychological crime novels exploring such themes as romantic obsession, misperceived communication, the impact of chance and coincidence, and the humanity of the criminals involved. Among such books are "A Judgement in Stone", "The Face of Trespass", "Live Flesh", "Talking to Strange Men", "The Killing Doll", "Going Wrong" and "Adam and Eve and Pinch Me (Rendell novel)|Adam and Eve and Pinch Me". For the last novel published in her lifetime, The Girl Next Door (Rendell novel)|"The Girl Next Door", she returned to the Loughton of her childhood, with an implied comparison of the moral climate of wartime England and 2014. <!--comment out unsupported claims Many credit her and close friend P. D. James for upgrading the entire genre of whodunit, shaping it more into a "why"dunit. Rendell's protagonists are often socially isolated, suffer from mental illness, and/or are otherwise disadvantaged; she explores the adverse impacts of their circumstances on these characters as well as on their victims.--> Rendell created a third strand of writing with the publication in 1986 of "A Dark-Adapted Eye" under her pseudonym Barbara Vine (the name was derived from her own middle name and her great grandmother's maiden name). "King Solomon's Carpet", "A Fatal Inversion" and "Asta's Book" (alternative U.S. title, "Anna's Book"), among others, inhabited the same territory as her psychological crime novels while further developing themes of human misunderstandings and the unintended consequences of family secrets and hidden crimes. The author was noted for her elegant prose and sharp insights into the human mind, as well as her cogent plots and characters. Rendell injected the social changes of the last 40 years into her work, bringing awareness to such issues as domestic violence. ==Adaptations of her works== The Inspector Wexford series was successfully televised, starring George Baker (British actor)|George Baker as Inspector Wexford and Christopher Ravenscroft as Detective Mike Burden, under the title "The Ruth Rendell Mysteries", with 48 episodes from 1987 to 2000.  Rendell praised Baker's performance, stating "It was a marvellous achievement as an actor to make him more and better than the author intended." Many of her other works have been adapted for film and television. She said that Claude Chabrol's 1995 version of "A Judgement in Stone", "La Cérémonie" with Sandrine Bonnaire, was one of the few film adaptations of her work that she was happy with. The novel was also filmed in 1986 with Rita Tushingham. Chabrol made "The Bridesmaid (film)|La Demoiselle d'honneur" in 2004, based on "The Bridesmaid". Other adaptations are "Diary of the Dead (1976 film)|Diary of the Dead" (1976), from the book "One Across, Two Down"; the 1997 Pedro Almodóvar film "Carne trémula|Live Flesh"; "The Tree of Hands", directed by Giles Foster for Granada with Lauren Bacall (U.S. title: "Innocent Victim"); and another version of  "The Tree of Hands", "Betty Fisher et autres histoires" (2001, a.k.a. "Alias Betty"), with screenplay and direction by Claude Miller. François Ozon's 2015 film "The New Girlfriend (f ...
