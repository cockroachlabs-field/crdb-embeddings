It had a brief commercial career before it was replaced by larger types. The He 70 had set eight world speed records by the beginning of 1933. ==Design and development== The Heinkel He 70 "Blitz" (Lightning) was designed in the early 1930s as a mailplane for "Deutsche Lufthansa" in response to a request for an aircraft faster than the Lockheed Model 9 Orion (used by Swissair) to service short routes. It had a cantilever low-wing monoplane, with an aerodynamically efficient elliptical wing and retractable undercarriage, and a single, nose-mounted engine. To meet the demanding speed requirements, care was taken to minimize drag, with flush rivets giving a smooth surface, and fully retractable main landing gear. The tail wheel was not retractable. It was powered by a  BMW VI V12 engine|V-12 engine cooled with ethylene glycol rather than water. This allowed a smaller radiator to be used, which also retracted at high speed to further reduce drag. The pilot and radio operator were seated in tandem, followed by a cabin seating four passengers in pairs facing each other.Smith and Kay 1972, p.232 The first prototype flew on 1 December 1932,Smith and Kay 1972, p.234 and proved to have excellent performance, setting eight world records for speed over distance, and reaching a maximum speed of .Donald 1999, p.494. ==Operational history== Luft Hansa operated He 70s between 1934 and 1937 for a fast flight service which connected Berlin with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne, as well as between Cologne and Hamburg. He 70s were flown abroad from Stuttgart to Seville between 1934 and 1936. The route was part of the South America mail service provided by Luft Hansa that continued via Banjul|Bathurst, The Gambia to Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal, Brazil, using Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52/3m and Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal flying boats. Remaining aircraft were transferred to the "Luftwaffe" in 1937.  File:Heinkel He-70K típusú távolfelderítő repülőgép. Fortepan 26468.jpg|thumb|Hungarian Air Force|Royal Hungarian Air Force He 70Ks The "Luftwaffe" operated He 70s from 1935, initially as a light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. As soon as purpose built designs became available, it was relegated to use as a liaison and courier aircraft. Twenty-eight aircraft were sent in the late 1930s to Spain with the German-manned "Condor Legion|Legion Condor", where they were used during the Spanish Civil War as fast Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance aircraft. There they were known as the "Rayo", Spanish for "lightning". = The He 70K (later given the List of RLM aircraft designations#101-200|RLM number: He 170) was a fast reconnaissance airplane export variant used by the Hungarian air force.  Powered by a Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major radial engine, the engines were built under license in Hungary as the IAR K14|WM-K-14, but the air frame and final assembly were in Germany. The new engines raised the top speed of the aircraft from . 18 were used by the Hungarian Air Force|Royal Hungarian Air Force from 1937 to 1942. = A major weakness of the He 70 in military use was the fire risk. Parts of the airframe were made out of an extremely flammable magnesium alloy called "Elektron (alloy)|Elektron", though the majority of the monocoque fuselage was Duralumin. Elektron is very light yet strong, but burns readily when ignited and is difficult to extinguish. Moreover, each wing contained a non-self-sealing  fuel tank, which may have further added to the aircraft's reputation for catching fire.  Other problems included poor defensive armament, short range and poor view from the cabin, all of which led to the Hungarian He 170A fleet being prematurely retired and replaced with obsolescent Heinkel He 46 parasol-wing monoplanes, until Focke-Wulf Fw 189 "Uhu" medium altitude observation aircraft could be introduced. ==Influence==  While the He 70 saw only limited service in training capacities during World War II, it was the Luftwaffe's first "Schnellbomber" and served as the antecedent for some of the bombers involved in the Battle of Britain.  The He 70 is known mainly as the ancestor to the Heinkel He 111, which had similar elliptical wings and streamlined fuselage in a twin-engined configuration. The He 111, which began service with the Luftwaffe in 1936, went on to become the most numerous bomber type of the Luftwaffe – with just over 5,600 examples produced during the war in total – in the early years of World War II. The He 70 was essentially scaled down to produce the Heinkel He 112|He 112 fighter which lost out on competition against the Messerschmitt Bf 109, but was nonetheless built in small numbers.  An He 70 was exported to Japan for study and inspired the Aichi D3A ("Val") carrier-launched light bomber.Mark Peattie, "Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909–1941", p. 94 This aircraft shared the He 70's distinctive, low-mounted elliptical wing.  Beverley Shenstone, R.J. Mitchell's aerodynamic advisor denied that the Spitfire wing was copied from the He 70. Shenstone said:  The Siegfried and Walter Günter|Günther brothers had already used an elliptical wing for the Bäumer Sausewind sports aircraft before they joined Heinkel. Shenstone said that the He 70's influence on the Spitfire design was limited to use as a benchmark for aerodynamic smoothness. ==Variants== ;He 70a :First prototype.
