The Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal government of Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister Paul Martin lost its majority government|majority but was able to continue in office as a minority government after the election. This was the first election contested by the newly amalgamated Conservative Party of Canada, after it was formed by the two centre-right politics|right-of-centre parties, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance. On May 23, 2004, the Governor General of Canada|governor general, Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of Martin, ordered the dissolution of the House of Commons, triggering an snap election|early election despite the Liberals being only three and a half years into their five-year mandate. Earlier, the election result was widely expected to be a fourth consecutive majority government for the Liberals, but early in 2004 Liberal popularity fell sharply due to the emerging details of the sponsorship scandal. Polls even started to indicate the possibility of a Conservative minority government. In the end, the Liberals won a minority government, though they were well short of a majority and lost nearly three dozen seats. On election day, polling times were arranged to allow results from most provinces to be announced more or less simultaneously, with the exception of Atlantic Canada, whose results were known before the close of polling in other provinces due to the British Columbia Supreme Court's decision in "R v Bryan". == Major political parties ==   Until the Liberal Party of Canada sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal, most pundits were predicting that new Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister Paul Martin would lead the Liberal Party of Canada to a fourth majority government, possibly setting a record for number of seats won. However, polls released immediately after the scandal broke showed Liberal support down as much as 10% nationwide, with greater declines in its heartland of Quebec and Ontario. Although there was some recovery in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, Liberal hopes of making unprecedented gains in the west faded. The unpopularity of some provincial Liberal parties may also have had an effect on federal Liberal fortunes. In Ontario, for instance, the Ontario Liberal Party|provincial Liberal government introduced an unpopular budget the week of the expected election call, and their federal counterparts then fell into a statistical dead heat with the Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives in polls there. The Liberals were also harmed by high-profile 2004 Liberal Party of Canada infighting|party infighting that had been plaguing the party since Martin's earlier ejection from Cabinet by now-former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. <!-- This section is linked from Stephen Harper --> In the final months of 2003, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance were running a distant third and fourth, respectively, in public opinion polls. Many pundits predicted that the combination of the popular and fiscally conservative Martin, along with continued vote-splitting on the right, could have led to the almost total annihilation of the Progressive Conservatives and Canadian Alliance. This fear prompted those two parties to form a united Conservative Party of Canada, which was approved by the members of the Canadian Alliance on December 5, 2003, and controversially by the delegates of the Progressive Conservatives on December 6, 2003. The new Conservative Party pulled well ahead of the NDP in the polls just before the election, although its support remained below the combined support that the Progressive Conservatives and the Alliance had as separate parties. On March 20, the Conservatives elected Stephen Harper as their new leader. The Conservatives gained more ground in polls after Harper became leader, and the poll results in the weeks before the election had them within one to two points of the Liberals, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind them. Party supporters hoped that the voters would react negatively to the Liberal attacks on what they called Harper's "hidden agenda", and that anger over the sponsorship scandal and other Liberal failures would translate to success at the polls. Late in the campaign, the Conservatives began to lose some momentum, in part due to remarks made by MPs. Scott Reid (politician)|Scott Reid, the party's language critic, said that the policy of official bilingualism was unrealistic and needed to be reformed.Campbell Morrison, “Harper gov’t would overhaul bilingualism; Requirement for mandatory bilingual services would be eased under Tory gov’t: candidate.” "Moncton Times and Transcript", May 27, 2004, p. A1. Rob Merrifield, health critic, suggested that women ought to have mandatory family counseling before they choose to have an abortion. Randy White (Canadian politician)|Randy White was quoted as saying "to heck with the courts" in reference to "Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage", suggesting the party would overturn same-sex marriage. Cheryl Gallant drew controversy when she compared abortion to the beheading of Iraq War hostage Nick Berg, and called for the repeal of recently amended hate laws that include sexual orientation as one of the protected groups. Additionally, the Liberal Party began airing controversial TV ads.  Harper was also criticized for his position supporting the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.  The term "hidden agenda", used commonly in the 2000 election to refer to Stockwell Day, began surfacing with increasing regularity with regard to Harper's history of supporting privatized health care. Further damaging the Conservative campaign was a press release from Conservative headquarters that suggested that Paul Martin supported child pornography.  The momentum began to swing against his party, although some polls suggested it was neck and neck right up until election day. Although on the eve of the election the party was polling slightly ahead of the Liberals everywhere west of Quebec, it had dropped in support, polling behind or on par with Liberals everywhere except the West (Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), where it held onto its traditional support. All together the new Conservatives fell from the combined Canadian Alliance-Progressive Conservative vote in 2000 of 37%, to only 29% of the vote, yet still gained 21 extra seats, finishing in second-place with 99 seats.  Before the announcement of the union of the right-of-centre parties, some were predicting that the New Democratic Party (Canada) would form the Official Opposition (Canada)|official opposition because the NDP was polling ahead of both right-of-centre parties.  A new leader (Jack Layton) and clear social democracy|social democratic policies helped revitalize the NDP. Polls suggested that the NDP had returned to the 18% to 20% level of support it enjoyed in the 1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election and 1988 Canadian federal election|1988 election. Layton suggested that the NDP would break their previous record of 43 seats won under former leader Ed Broadbent. The NDP focused the campaign on winning ridings in Canada's urban centres, hoping especially to win seats in central Toronto, Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton, Ottawa and Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg. The party's platform was built to cater to these regions and much of Layton's time was spent in these areas. The campaign stumbled early when Layton blamed the deaths of homeless people on Paul Martin, prompting the Liberals to accuse the NDP of negative campaigning. The NDP benefited from the decline in Liberal support, but not to the same extent as the Conservatives. There was an increasing prospect that NDP voters would switch to the Liberals to block a Conservative government. This concern did not manifest itself in the polls, however, and the NDP remained at somewhat below 20 percent mark in the polls for most of the campaign. The NDP achieved 15% of the popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won in 1997, and far short of the 40 predicted. There was criticism that Layton's focus on urban issues and gay rights marginalized the party's traditional emphasis on the poor, the working class, and rural Canadians. Long-time MP Lorne Nystrom and several other incumbents from the Prairie provinces were defeated, with the NDP being shut out of Saskatchewan for the first time since 1965 Canadian federal election|1965. Layton won his own seat in a tight race, while Broadbent was returned to Parliament after many years of absence.  The Bloc Québécois (BQ) had managed their best showing back in 1993, but they lost seats to the Liberals in 1997 and 2000, prompting pundits to suggest a decline in support for Quebec sovereignty. The Bloc continued to slide in the polls in most of 2003 after the election of the federalist Quebec Liberal Party at the National Assembly of Quebec under Jean Charest, and during the long run-up to Paul Martin becoming leader of the federal Liberals. However, things progressively changed during 2003, partly because of the decline in popularity of the Liberal Party of Quebec government of Jean Charest, and partly because support for Quebec sovereignty movement|independence in Quebec rose again (49% in March). The tide took its sharp turn when, in February 2004, the sponsorship scandal (uncovered in considerable part by the Bloc) hit the Liberal federal government. These events led to a resurgence of the BQ, putting it ahead of the pack once again: according to an Ipsos-Reid poll carried out for "The Globe and Mail" and CTV Television Network|CTV between the June 4 and 8, 50% of Quebecers intended to vote for the BQ against 24% for the Liberals. File:Jim Harris of the Green Party - 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|120px|Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris, Greens Leader Speculation was ongoing about the possibility of the Bloc forming alliances with other opposition parties or with an eventual minority government to promote its goals of social democracy and respect of the autonomy of provinces. Leader Gilles Duceppe stated that the Bloc, as before, would co-operate with other opposition parties or with the government when interests were found to be in common, but that the Bloc would not participate in a coalition government.  The Green Party of Canada|Greens ran candidates in all 308 ridings for the first time in its history. The party won twice as many votes in this election than it had over the previous 21 years of its history combined, although it failed to win a seat. It also spent more money than in the previous 21 years, and although mu ...
