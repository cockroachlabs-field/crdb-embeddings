These usually involved the knight-to-be taking a bath (possibly symbolic of spiritual purification)Risk, "History of the Order of the Bath", p. 6. during which he was instructed in the duties of knighthood by more senior knights. He was then put to bed to dry. Clothed in a special robe, he was led with music to the chapel where he spent the night in a vigil. At dawn he made Confession (religion)|confession and attended Mass (liturgy)|Mass, then retired to his bed to sleep until it was fully daylight. He was then brought before the King, who after instructing two senior knights to buckle the spurs to the knight-elect's heels, fastened a belt around his waist, then struck him on the neck (with either a hand or a sword), thus making him a knight."The Manner of making Knights after the custom of England in time of peace and at the Coronation, that is Knights of the Bath", quoted in Perkins, pp. 5–14. It was this accolade which was the essential act in creating a knight, and a simpler ceremony developed, conferring knighthood merely by striking or touching the knight-to-be on the shoulder with a sword,According to Anstis ("Observations", p. 73) such knights were sometimes known as "Knights of the Sword" or "Knights of the Carpet" or "dubbing" him, as is still done today. In the early medieval period the difference seems to have been that the full ceremonies were used for men from more prominent families. From the coronation of Henry IV of England|Henry IV in 1399 the full ceremonies were restricted to major royal occasions such as coronation of the British monarch|coronations, investitures of the Prince of Wales or royal dukes, and royal weddings,Anstis, p. 66. and the knights so created became known as "Knights of the Bath". Knight Bachelor|Knights Bachelor continued to be created with the simpler form of ceremony. The last occasion on which Knights of the Bath were created was the coronation of Charles II of England|Charles II in 1661. From at least 1625,Risk, p. 114. and possibly from the reign of James VI and I|James I, Knights of the Bath were using the motto "Tria juncta in uno" (Latin for "Three joined in one"), and wearing as a badge three crowns within a plain gold oval.Nicolas, "History of the orders of knighthood of the British empire", p. 38–39. These were both subsequently adopted by the Order of the Bath; a similar design of badge is still worn by members of the Civil Division. Their symbolism however is not entirely clear. The 'three joined in one' may be a reference to the kingdoms of Kingdom of England|England, Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland and either Kingdom of France|France or Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland, which were held (or English claims to the French throne|claimed in the case of France) by English and, later, British monarchs. This would correspond to the three crowns in the badge.The later usage by the Order of the Bath does not make things any clearer. The presence of the rose, thistle and shamrock (symbols of England, Scotland, and Ireland, respectively) in the Collar supports the above claim. The shamrocks however were not added until the 19th century, probably as a result of a suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks, who in his proposal observed that the presence of the shamrock would "greatly augment the meaning of the motto" (Risk, p 115). A further explanation for the crowns is provided in the 1725 statutes of the Order. The coat of arms which was to appear on the Order's seal ("Azure three imperial crowns Or", that is, three gold imperial crowns on a blue background) was described as being anciently attributed to King Arthur. Another explanation of the motto is that it refers to the Holy Trinity. Nicolas quotes a source (although he is sceptical of it) who claims that prior to James I the motto was "Tria numina juncta in uno" (three powers/gods joined in one), but from the reign of James I the word "numina" was dropped and the motto understood to mean "Tria  juncta in uno" (three kingdoms joined in one).Nicolas, p 38, quoting Bishop Kennet "Register and Chronicle Ecclesiastical and Civil from the Restoration of King Charles II faithfully taken from the manuscripts of the Lord Bishop of Peterborough", (1728) p. 410.  File:Robertwalpole.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister, who used the Order of the Bath as a source of political patronage The prime mover in the establishment of the Order of the Bath was John Anstis, Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms, England's highest heraldry|heraldic officer. Anthony Wagner|Sir Anthony Wagner, a recent holder of the office of Garter, wrote of Anstis's motivations: <blockquote>It was Martin Leake'sGarter King of Arms from 1754 to 1773, and an officer of arms for some 25 years before that opinion that the trouble and opposition Anstis met with in establishing himself as Garter so embittered him against the heralds that when at last in 1718 he succeeded, he made it his prime object to aggrandise himself and his office at their expense. It is clear at least that he set out to make himself indispensable to the Earl Marshal, which was not hard, their political principles being congruous and their friendship already established, but also to Sir Robert Walpole and the British Whig Party|Whig ministry, which can by no means have been easy, considering his known attachment to the Pretender and the circumstances under which he came into office. ... The main object of Anstis's next move, the revival or institution of the Order of the Bath was probably that which it in fact secured, of ingratiating him with the all-powerful Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole.Wagner, pp. 348, 357.</blockquote> The use of honours in the early eighteenth century differed considerably from the modern British honours system|honours system in which hundreds, if not thousands, of people each year receive honours on the basis of deserving accomplishments. The only honours available at that time were hereditary (not life) peerages and baronetcies, knighthoods and the Order of the Garter (or the Order of the Thistle for Scots), none of which were awarded in large numbers (the Garter and the Thistle are limited to 24 and 16 living members respectively.) The political environment was also significantly different from today: <blockquote>The Sovereign still exercised a power to be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.Risk, p. 2.</blockquote> File:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|thumb|Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral George Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Lord Rodney (appointed a Knight Companion in 1780) wearing the riband and star of the Order The attraction of the new Order for Walpole was that it would provide a source of such favours to strengthen his political position. He made sure that most of the 36 new honorees were Peerages in the United Kingdom|peers and MPs who would provide him with useful connections.Andrew Hanham, "The Politics of Chivalry: Sir Robert Walpole, the Duke of Montagu and the Order of the Bath." "Parliamentary History" 35.3 (2016): 262–297.In the words of his son, Horace Walpole, "The Revival of the Order of the Bath was a measure of Sir Robert Walpole, and was an artful bank of favours in lieu of places. He meant to stave off the demand for Garters, and intended that the Red  should be a step to the Blue ; and accordingly took one of the former for himself." Horace Walpole, "Reminiscences" (1788) George I having agreed to Walpole's proposal, Anstis was commissioned to draft statutes for the Order of the Bath. As noted above, he adopted the motto and badge used by the Knights of the Bath, as well as the colour of the riband and Mantle (clothing)|mantle, and the ceremony for creating a knight. The rest of the statutes were mostly based on those of the Order of the Garter, of which he was an officer (as Garter King of Arms).Nicolas, p. 237–238, footnote. The Order was founded by letters patent under the  ...
