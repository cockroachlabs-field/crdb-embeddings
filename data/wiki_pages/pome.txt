  Pomme}} File:Pome apples text.jpg|thumb|right|An apple is a pome fruit. The parts of the fruit are labelled. In botany, a "pome" is a type of fruit produced by flowering plants in the subtribe Malinae of the family Rosaceae. Pome fruits consist of a central "core" containing multiple small seeds, which is enveloped by a tough membrane and surrounded by an edible layer of flesh. Pome fruit trees are deciduous, and undergo a dormant winter period that requires cold temperatures to break dormancy in spring. Well-known pomes include the apple, pear, and quince. ==Etymology== The word "pome" entered English in the late 14th century, and referred to an apple or an apple-shaped object. It derived from the Old French word for "apple":  (12th century; modern French is ), which in turn derived from the Late Latin or Vulgar Latin word  "apple", originally the plural of Latin  "fruit", later "apple". == Morphology == A pome is an accessory fruit composed of one or more Gynoecium|carpels surrounded by accessory tissue. The accessory tissue is interpreted by some specialists as an extension of the receptacle (botany)|receptacle and is then referred to as "fruit cortex",Esau, K. 1977. "Anatomy of seed plants". John Wiley and Sons, New York. and by others as a fused hypanthium (floral cup). It is the most edible part of this fruit. The carpels of a pome are fused within the "core". Although the epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp of some other fruit types look very much like the skin, flesh, and core respectively of a pome, they are parts of the carpel (see above diagram). The epicarp and mesocarp of a pome may be fleshy and difficult to distinguish from one another and from the hypanthial tissue. The endocarp forms a leathery or stony case around the seed, and corresponds to what is commonly called the core.  Pome-type fruit with stony rather than leathery endocarp may be called a "Pyrena|polypyrenous drupe".  The shriveled remains of the sepals, Gynoecium|style and stamens can sometimes be seen at the end of a pome opposite the stem, and the ovary (plants)|ovary is therefore often described as ovary (plants)#Inferior ovary|inferior in these flowers. ==Examples== Image:Mespilus germanica 01.jpg|thumb|right|Pomes of common medlar, "Mespilus germanica" The best-known example of a pome is the apple. Other examples of plants that produce fruit classified as a pome are "Cotoneaster", "Crataegus" (hawthorn and mayhaw), medlar, pear, "Pyracantha", quince, rowan, loquat, toyon, and whitebeam. Some pomes may have a mealy texture (e.g., some apples); others (e.g., "Amelanchier", "Aronia") are berry-like with juicy flesh and a core that is not very noticeable. ==See also== * Cider * Nut (fruit) ==References==  == External links == *   Category:Fruit morphology
