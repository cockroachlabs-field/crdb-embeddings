He first became a member of the Bundestag in the 1980 West German federal election|1980 West German elections, via the party list, for the constituency of Celle-Uelzen.

Smith (14 January 2004),  "New York Times". While being a strong supporter of conscription, "Deutsche Welle", 23 July 2002. Struck announced in 2003 that Germany would reduce its military by more than 10 percent by 2010, leaving 250,000 troops. Also, he ordered a reduction in Germany's inventory of heavy Leopard 2 tanks from almost 2,000 to 350.Konstantin von Hammerstein and Alexander Szandar (6 September 2006),  "Spiegel Online".

In 2004, he said “there will be a clear no from the German side” to any request to place the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom under a unified command, expressing fears a unified command could be a step towards merging the two forces and that political opposition and military dangers could increase if their soldiers were identified with the US-led coalition.Daniel Dombey, Rainer Koch and Victoria Burnett (14 October 2004),  "Financial Times". After Germany joined with France in April 2003 to announce the creation of a European Union defense group with a military planning unit separate from NATO, Struck later held that no separate headquarters was necessary and that a planning staff for eventual operations under solely European auspices should be attached to NATO.John Vinocur (28 October 2003),  "International Herald Tribune". In 2003, Struck dismissed General Reinhard Günzel, the commander of a German special forces army unit, after he praised Martin Hohmann, a conservative member of Parliament, for a speech that had been widely criticized as anti-Semitic; Struck called Günzel a "lone, confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement."Richard Bernstein (5 November 2003),  "New York Times". After accusations began appearing in the German press that conscripts in the German Army had been physically abused by trainers at some of the country's army bases, Struck announced in December 2004 that 30 or 40 trainers were being investigated.Richard Bernstein (2 December 2004),  "New York Times".

"Focus (German magazine)|Focus", 3 January 2013. ==Controversies== When an elderly man was severely beaten up in Munich by two immigrant youths, Struck claimed that his political opponent, Roland Koch, was probably happy for the beating because now Koch could start a supposedly polemic discussion about problems with young violent immigrants. When Koch demanded an apology, Struck replied "Bite me!". In a Parliament debate some days later, Jürgen Gehb, CDU Speaker for law politics, said that "we will try to continue working with you, but with minimal contact to your backside". At a 2002 meeting of NATO defense ministers in Warsaw, United States Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld refused to meet Struck after Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had won narrow re-election in part by opposing the American-led Iraq War.Steven Erlanger (24 September 2002),  "New York Times". ==Quotes== Peter Struck is famous for two quotes: *"The security of the Federal Republic of Germany is being defended in the Hindu Kush too".In German: "Die Sicherheit der Bundesrepublik Deutschland wird auch am Hindukusch verteidigt".  :"as Minister of Defence, reconciling the traditional view of the Bundeswehr as defence-only army with the problems of asymmetric war." *"Legislation always obeys the First Struckian Law: No bill comes out of Parliament in the form it came into Parliament." :"as SPD whip, rather humorously describing the legislative process." ==See also== * Politics of Germany ==References==  ==External links==  *                    }}   Category:1943 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Politicians from Göttingen Category:Defence ministers of Germany Category:Members of the Bundestag for Lower Saxony Category:Jurists from Lower Saxony Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:University of Hamburg alumni Category:Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Members of the Bundestag 2005–2009 Category:Members of the Bundestag 2002–2005 Category:Members of the Bundestag 1994–1998 Category:Members of the Bundestag for the Social Democratic Party of Germany
