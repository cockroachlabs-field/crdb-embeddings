Situated to the north of the Manchester city centre|city centre on Hunts Bank, close to Manchester Cathedral, it adjoins Manchester Arena which was constructed on part of the former station site in the 1990s. Opened in 1844 and part of the Manchester station group, Victoria is Manchester's third busiest railway station after Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly and Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Oxford Road and the second busiest station managed by Northern (train operating company)|Northern after Oxford Road. The station hosts local and regional services to destinations in Northern England, such as , , Bradford Interchange|Bradford, , , , Halifax railway station (West Yorkshire)|Halifax, Wigan Wallgate railway station|Wigan, , Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool (Sundays only) and Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool using the original Manchester and Liverpool Railway|Liverpool to Manchester line. Most trains calling at Victoria are operated by Northern. TransPennine Express services call at the station from Liverpool to Newcastle/Scarborough and services towards Manchester Airport (via the Ordsall Chord) from Middlesbrough/Redcar/Newcastle. Manchester Victoria is a #Victoria tram stop|major interchange for the Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink light rail system. Two former railway lines into the station have been converted to tram operations: the Bury Line|line to Bury was converted in the early 1990s, in the first phase of Metrolink construction, and the line Oldham and Rochdale Line|through Oldham to Rochdale was converted during 2009–2014. In the other direction, trams switch to on-street running when they emerge from Victoria Station and continue southwards through the city centre to Piccadilly or Deansgate-Castlefield. In 2009, Victoria was voted the worst United Kingdom railway station categories|category B interchange station in the United Kingdom. The station underwent a two-year £44million modernisation programme which was completed in August 2015. Renovation entailed electrification of lines through the station, renewed Metrolink stop with an additional platform, restoration of listed features, upgraded retail units, and a new roof. The Ordsall Chord directly linking Victoria to Oxford Road and Piccadilly was completed in December 2017. == History == File:Manchester RJD 47.JPG|thumb|left|Railway Clearing House map of central Manchester railways in 1910 File:Manchester Victoria's original building 1989 - geograph.org.uk - 820318.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the original 1844 station building, photographed in 1989, originally it had a single storey, the second storey was added in the 1860s.  The Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) was founded in 1836 and the company began building its line between Manchester and Leeds in 1837. Originally its line terminated at Manchester Oldham Road railway station|Manchester Oldham Road, which opened on 3 July 1839. The company realised it would be advantageous to join its line to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR), creating a through route from Liverpool to Yorkshire with a joint station serving the centre of Manchester. In 1839, Samuel Brooks (railway pioneer)|Samuel Brooks, vice-chairman of the M&LR, bought land at Hunt's Bank close to the cathedral and presented it to the company for the new station. The site was on the north bank of the River Irk, between the workhouse to the north which had opened in 1793 and Walker's Croft Cemetery to the south. After several years of negotiations between the companies, work started in 1842. The M&LR built an extension from Miles Platting to the station which opened on 1 January 1844. On this date, the Oldham Road terminus was closed to passenger services and became a goods station. The new station had a  long single platform which handled M&LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The L&MR extended its line from Ordsall, Greater Manchester|Ordsall to Victoria and its trains operated from the western end from 4 May 1844, on which date its Manchester Liverpool Road railway station|Liverpool Road station terminus became a goods station. The station was named Victoria in 1843. Its long, single-storey building, designed by George Stephenson and completed by John Brogden (industrialist)|John Brogden, was approached by a wooden footbridge over the River Irk before the river was culverted. Most of the original 1844 station buildings are standing including part of the original façade on Hunt's Bank. The L&MR became part of the Grand Junction Railway in 1845, which in turn amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846; the M&LR amalgamated with other railways to create the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) the following year. The headquarters of the L&YR were based alongside Victoria.

Victoria Station dominated the Long Millgate area and was one of the biggest passenger stations in Britain. Victoria underwent several phases of expansion as traffic grew. In 1865, four bay platforms were built on the eastern side on land reclaimed from the cemetery, and another was built on the western side, a second through platform was built at the northern side, and the station's facilities were expanded by the construction of a new east wing of the station building. Two decades later, the L&YR purchased and demolished the workhouse north of the station, and its site was used to build another bay and five through platforms which came into use in 1884. That same year, the LNWR opened its own station,  immediately to the west on the opposite side of the River Irwell, and vacated Victoria.

Victoria reached its maximum extent of 17 platforms in 1904 when the station was enlarged with extra bay platforms to the south. The present station façade, designed by William Dawes, was built in 1909. The cast-iron train sheds behind the façade were  long. Because the station handled large amounts of parcel and newspaper traffic, an overhead parcels carrier system was constructed in 1895. It consisted of an overhead track which ran in a circuit around the station, upon which electrically powered trolleys ran suspended from the track, operated by airborne attendants. A large basket could be raised and lowered from the trolleys to distribute parcels and newspapers across the station. The system operated until 1940. The L&YR merged with the LNWR on 1 January 1922. A year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). From 16 April 1929, Victoria and Exchange station were linked by the westward extension of platform 11 over the Irwell bridge, known as platform "11 Middle", which joined to Exchange's platform 3 to create Europe's longest platform at . Crossovers enabled it to accommodate three trains arriving and departing independently.Joyce, J. (1982), Roads and Rails of Manchester 1900-1950, Ian Allan Ltd, p-23 Marshall, John (1970), The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, volume 2, Newton Abbot: David & Charles, p=67  Exchange Station closed in 1969 and its services were transferred to Victoria. The Exchange Station site opposite the cathedral was for many years used as a car park, until redevelopment of the site began in 2015. The station suffered bomb damage during the Manchester Blitz in World War II. On 23 December 1940, several bombs hit the station destroying the parcels office, and a large part of the roof over platforms 12 to 16. The parcels office was rebuilt, but the damaged parts of the roof were taken down and not replaced. The station came into the ownership of British Railways in 1948.  Proposals to build an underground station, "Victoria Low Level" as part of the Picc-Vic tunnel project emerged in the early-1970s. publicity brochure The scheme proposed creating a direct rail link between Victoria and  via a tunnel and creating several underground stations in Manchester city centre. Platforms 1–4 at Victoria were taken out of use in 1973 in anticipation of the tunnel coming to the surface in that part of the station. The tunnel project was cancelled in the late 1970s because of high costs, and in the 1980s transport planners turned to light rail as a lower-cost option. As a result, the stations were linked by the Manchester Metrolink system which opened in 1992. A street-level tramway was built across the city centre linking the stations and two converted rail lines to Altrincham Line|Altrincham and Bury Line|Bury. The #Victoria tram stop|tram stop at Victoria replaced the former Bury Line platforms and the tram line was extended into the streets through a new entrance in the side of the station.
