FRC promotes what it considers to be family values. It opposes and lobbies against: access to pornography, Stem cell controversy|embryonic stem-cell research, abortion, divorce, and LGBT rights (such as anti-discrimination laws, same-sex marriage, civil union|same-sex civil unions, and LGBT adoption). The FRC has been criticized by media sources and professional organizations such as the American Sociological Association for using "anti-gay pseudoscience" to falsely conflate homosexuality and pedophilia, and falsely to claim that the children of same-sex parents suffer from more mental health problems. FRC was formed in the United States in 1981 by James Dobson and incorporated in 1983. In the late 1980s, FRC officially became a division of Dobson's main organization, Focus on the Family; however, after an administrative separation, FRC became an independent entity in 1992. Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins is its current president. FRC is affiliated with a lobbying political action committee|PAC known as FRC Action, of which Josh Duggar was the executive director from 2013 until 2015., "The New York Times", December 9, 2021 The FRC is active outside of America; in 2010, FRC paid $25,000 to congressional lobbyists for what they described as "Res.1064 Ugandan Resolution Pro-homosexual promotion" in a lobbying disclosure report. Uganda would go on to pass the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, a bill which would have imposed either the death penalty or life imprisonment for sexual relations between persons of the same sex. On 1 August 2014, however, the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the act invalid on procedural grounds. In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center classified FRC as an List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-LGBT hate groups|anti-LGBT hate group due to what it says are the group's "false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science" in an effort to block LGBT civil rights. In 2012, the FRC's headquarters were attacked by a gunman, resulting in an injury to a security guard, in connection with this designation. ==History== File:Perkins-dobson-01.jpg|thumb|left|Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins and James Dobson at the Values Voters conference in Washington, D.C., 2007 The Council was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1983.Timothy J.
