The subprefecture covers  and in 2011 had a population of 2,334,241. The subprefecture takes its name from the Ishikari River, the third longest in Japan, which flows through western Hokkaido and empties into the Sea of Japan in the city of Ishikari, Hokkaido|Ishikari. There are 6 cities, three towns, and one village under its jurisdiction. Sapporo is both the capital of Hokkaido Prefecture and Ishikari Subprefecture. Shikotsu-Toya National Park is located in the southern part of the subprefecture, and Shokanbetsu-Teuri-Yagishiri Quasi-National Park in the north. ==Etymology== The word Ishikari comes from the Ainu language, and several theories exist as to the meaning of the name. *The most common translation of "Ishikari", proposed by the missionary and researcher of the Ainu language John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor (1854 &ndash; 1944) in 1935, is "a greatly wandering river", a reference to the meandering path of the Ishikari River. According to Batchelor "Ishikari" is a corruption of "i-sikar-pet" or "ishikaripet". The 'i' sound of i-sikar-pet is a prefix meaning "greatly" or "exceedingly"; "shikari" meaning "zigzag" or "serpentine", and "pet" is the Ainu word for river. *Tōgo Yoshida (1864 &ndash; 1918), proposed in the "Dai Nihon Chimei Jisho", published between 1907 and 1910, that "Ishikaripet" had its origin in the Ainu language word "Ishikarapet", meaning "a beautifully formed river"; "ishu" meaning "beautiful", "kara" meaning "constructed" and "pet" meaning river. "Ishikari" is written in the Japanese language using "ateji", or kanji characters used to phonetically represent native or borrowed words. The first, , means to "stone", and the second, , means "to hunt". The meaning of the written form of Ishikari has no relationship to the meaning of word in the Ainu language. == Geography ==  {| class="wikitable sortable" ! colspan="2" |Name ! rowspan="2" |Area (km<sup>2</sup>) ! rowspan="2" |Population ! rowspan="2" |District ! rowspan="2" |Type ! rowspan="2" |Map |- !Romanization of Japanese|Rōmaji !Kanji |- |File:Flag of Chitose, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Chitose, Hokkaido|Chitose |千歳市 |594.5 |96,475 | rowspan="6" |"no district" | rowspan="6" |City |File:Chitose in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Ebetsu, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Ebetsu |江別市 |187.57 |119,086 |File:Ebetsu in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Eniwa, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Eniwa, Hokkaido|Eniwa |恵庭市 |294.87 |68,883 |File:Eniwa in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Ishikari, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Ishikari, Hokkaido|Ishikari |石狩市 |721.86 |58,755 |File:Ishikari in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Kitahiroshima, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Kitahiroshima, Hokkaido|Kitahiroshima |北広島市 |118.54 |58,918 |File:Kitahiroshima in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Sapporo, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Sapporo (prefectural and subprefectural capital) |札幌市 |1,121.26 |1,973,432 |File:Sapporo in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Shinshinotsu, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Shinshinotsu, Hokkaido|Shinshinotsu |新篠津村 |78.24 |3,235 | rowspan="2" |Ishikari District, Hokkaido|Ishikari District |Village |File:Shinshinotsu in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |- |File:Flag of Tobetsu, Hokkaido.svg|frameless|25x25px Tōbetsu, Hokkaido|Tōbetsu |当別町 |422.71 |16,694 |Town |File:Tobetsu in Hokkaido Prefecture Ja.svg|frameless|55x55px |}   == History == *1897: Sapporo Subprefecture established. *1922: Renamed Ishikari Subprefecture. *1996: Hiroshima Town becomes Kitahiroshima, Hokkaido|Kitahiroshima City, dissolving Sapporo District. ==Transportation== Ishikari Prefecture has two airports, both serving the greater Sapporo area. * Okadama Airport (Domestic) * New Chitose Airport (International) (Located in the city of Chitose, Hokkaido|Chitose) ==References==  ==External links== *     Category:Subprefectures in Hokkaido
