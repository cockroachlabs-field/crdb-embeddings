   "Gija", also spelt "Gidja" and "Kija", alternatively known as the "Lungga", }} refers to Aboriginal Australians from the East Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley area of Western Australia, about 200&nbsp;km south of Kununurra, Western Australia|Kununurra. In the late 19th century Cattle station|pastoralists were fiercely resisted by Gija people, many of whom now live around localities such as Halls Creek, Western Australia|Halls Creek and Warmun Community, Western Australia|Warmun (also known as Turkey Creek). ==Language== Gija language|Gija does not belong to the Pamaâ€“Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan language family which covers most Australian aboriginal tongues, but is a member of the small Jarrakan languages|Jarrakan language group. It is still spoken by from 100 to 200 people. ==Country== The Gija's traditional territory consisted of an estimated . On Pentecost River|Salmond, Chamberlain River|Chamberlain, and Wilson River (Western Australia)|Wilson rivers. The western boundary ran up to the foothills of the Bluff Face Range. They also lived and hunted around Margaret River (Kimberley, Western Australia)|the upper Margaret River, above the Ramsay Range gorge. Their easternmost lands ran as far as Halls Creek and Alice Downs. Sites associated with the Gija are Macphee Creek, as far north as Sugarloaf Hill, the Durack River|Durack Range, Lissadell and Warmun Community, Western Australia|Turkey Creek Station, Fig Tree Pool and the headwaters of Stony River. ==History of contact== The last known massacre of the Gija people took place at Bedford Downs Station in 1924, when, according to Gija tradition, Paddy Quilty and others at the Bedford station took tribesmen off the station and fed them food laced with strychnine. The corpses of those they killed were then heaped up and burnt on a funeral pyre to eliminate traces of the deed. ==Modern period== In 1979, mining explorations teams discovered pink diamond|pink and red diamond|reddish diamonds, quite rare at the time, at Smoke Creek and at Barramundi Gap, a key site in Gija female Dreamtime|dreaming. Subsequently the Argyle diamond mine was established. Employment of local people remained low, 10% in 2003, when strategies changed. Now a quarter of the workforce is recruited from local indigenous people.

Qantas adapted Paddy Bedford's artwork for use on a Boeing 737. ==Notable people== * Paddy Bedford (1922-2007), Gija artist * Josie Farrer, Australian parliamentarian. Member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia since 2013, representing the seat of Kimberley. *Stacy Mader, the first Aboriginal Australian to obtain a PhD in astronomy. * Lena Nyadbi, Gija artist whose works on barramundi scale designs have been exhibited in Paris, notable on the roof of the Musee du Quai Branly, and only viewable from the Eiffel Tower. The work was commissioned by the Museum; Nyadbi's design represents the Dreamtime|dreaming story of the barramundi, eluding capture to shed its scales across the landscape. The scales are metaphors for the pink Argyle diamonds, now mined by Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto on Gija land. With the positioning on the rooftop, Nyadbi's intent was to have the barramundi appear poised to flip back into the Seine. ==Notes==    ==Sources==  * }} * * * * * * * }} * * * * }} *  == External links == * , at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies   Category:Aboriginal peoples of Western Australia Category:Kimberley (Western Australia)
