In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil received a significant number of immigrants, primarily of Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese,Italian Brazilian|Italian and Spanish Brazilian|Spanish origin, which along with smaller numbers of German Brazilian|Germans, Austrian Brazilians|Austrians, Arab Brazilian|Arabs, Japanese Brazilian|Japanese, Polish Brazilian|Poles and Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukrainians gave a relevant contribution to the formation of regional cultures immigration to Brazil|in Brazil, and thus contributed to its current existence as a Cultural pluralism|plural and racially diverse society. As consequence of three centuries of colonization by the Portuguese empire, the core of Brazilian culture is derived from the culture of Portugal. The numerous Portuguese inheritances include the Portuguese language|language, cuisine items such as rice and beans and "feijoada", the predominant Catholic Church|religion and the Manueline|colonial architectural styles. These aspects, however, were influenced by African and Indigenous American traditions, as well as those from other Western European countries. Some aspects of Brazilian culture are contributions of Italian Brazilian|Italian, Spanish Brazilians|Spaniard, German Brazilian|German, Japanese Brazilians|Japanese and other European immigration to Brazil|European immigrants. <!-- tertiary source --> Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian people and Afro-Brazilians|Africans played a large role in the formation of Brazilian language, cuisine, music, dance and religion. This diverse cultural background has helped show off many celebrations and festivals that have become known around the world, such as the Brazilian Carnival and the Bumba Meu Boi. The colourful culture creates an environment that makes Brazil a popular destination for many tourists each year, around over 1 million. ==History==  File:Brazilians 001.JPG|thumb|right|The Brazilian people have several ethnic groups. First row: Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese, German Brazilian|German, Italian Brazilian|Italian, Arab Brazilian|Arab, and Japanese Brazilian|Japanese respectively. Second row: Afro-Brazilian|African,  (,  and , respectively) and Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Indigenous (Amerindian) Brazilians. Brazil was a colony of Portugal for over three centuries. About a million Portuguese settlers arrived during this period  and brought their culture to the colony. The Indigenous inhabitants of Brazil had much contact with the colonists. Many became extinct, others mixed with the Portuguese. For that reason, Brasil also holds Amerindian influences in its culture, mainly in its food and language. Brazilian Portuguese has hundreds of words of Indigenous American origin, mainly from the Old Tupi language. Ethnic groups of Africa|Black Africans, who were brought as slaves to Brazil, also participated actively in the formation of Brazilian culture. Although the Portuguese colonists forced their slaves to convert to Catholicism and speak Portuguese their cultural influences were absorbed by the inhabitants of Brazil of all Human race|races and origins. Some regions of Brazil, especially Bahia, have particularly notable African inheritances in music, cuisine, dance and language. Immigration to Brazil|Immigrants from Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Austria-Hungary and the Middle East played an important role in the areas they settled (mostly Southern Brazil|Southern and Southeastern Brazil). They organized communities that became important cities such as Joinville, Caxias do Sul, Blumenau, Curitiba and brought important contributions to the culture of Brazil. Modernism in Brazil started with the Modern Art Week held in São Paulo in 1922 and was characterized by experimentation and interest in Brazilian society and culture, as well as rebellion against influence from Brazil–European Union relations#History|Europe and the Brazil–United States relations|United States and the orthodoxy of the Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters.

It is spoken by about 99% of the population, making it one of the strongest elements of national identity.  There are only some Amerindian groups and small pockets of immigrants who do not speak Portuguese. Similarly to American English and Canadian French, Brazilian Portuguese is more phonetically conservative or archaic than the language of the colonizing metropolis, maintaining several features that European Portuguese had before the 19th century.Noll, Volker, ""Das Brasilianische Portugiesisch"", 1999. Also similarly to the American English, the Brazilian regional variation as well as the Portuguese language|European one include a small number of words of Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous American and Languages of Africa|African origin, mainly restricted to place names and fauna and flora. Minority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants. There are significant communities of German language|German (mostly the Hunsrückisch, a German language|High German language dialect) and Italian language|Italian (mostly the Talian dialect, of Venetian language|Venetian origin) speakers in the south of the country, both of which are influenced by the Portuguese language. Not to mention the Slavic communities, Ukrainians and Poles which are also part of these minority languages. The Brazilian Sign Language (not signed Portuguese – it likely is descended from the French Sign Language), known by the acronym , is officially recognized by law, albeit using it alone would convey a very limited degree of accessibility, throughout the country. ==Religion== {{Multiple image | align =  | direction =  | total_width = 400 | image1 = O Cristo Redentor.JPG | alt1 =  | caption1 = "Christ the Redeemer (st ...
