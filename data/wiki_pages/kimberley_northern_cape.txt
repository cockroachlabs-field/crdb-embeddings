It is located approximately 110&nbsp;km east of the confluence of the Vaal River|Vaal and Orange Rivers. The city has considerable historical significance due to its diamond mining past and the Siege of Kimberley|siege during the Second Boer War|Second Anglo-Boer war. British businessmen Cecil Rhodes and Barney Barnato made their fortunes in Kimberley, and Rhodes established the De Beers diamond company in the early days of the mining town. It was one of the host cities for the 2010 Fifa World Cup. On 2 September 1882, Kimberley was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and the second in the world after Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States of America|United States to integrate electric street lights into its infrastructure. The first stock exchange in Africa was built in Kimberley, as early as 1881. == History ==  In 1866, Erasmus Jacobs found a small brilliant pebble on the banks of the Orange River, on the farm "De Kalk" leased from local Griqua people|Griquas, near Hopetown, which was his father's farm. He showed the pebble to his father, who then sold it. The pebble was purchased from Jacobs' father by Schalk van Niekerk, who later sold it on again. It proved to be a  diamond, and became known as the Eureka Diamond|Eureka. Three years later, in 1869, an  diamond, which became known as the Star of South Africa (diamond)|Star of South Africa, was found nearby (). This diamond was sold by van Niekerk for £11,200, and later resold in the London market for £25,000. File:Red Cap Party.jpg|thumb|right|Fleetwood Rawstorne's "Red Cap Party" of prospectors on Colesberg Kopje Henry Richard Giddy recounted how Esau Damoense (or Damon), the cook for prospector Fleetwood Rawstorne's "Red Cap Party", found diamonds in 1871 on Colesberg Kopje after he was sent there to dig as punishment. Rawstorne took the news to the nearby diggings of the De Beer brothers – his arrival there sparking off the famous "New Rush" which, as historian Brian Roberts (Historian)|Brian Roberts puts it, was practically a stampede. Within a month, 900 claims were cut into the hillock, which were worked frenetically by two to three thousand men. As the land was lowered, so the hillock became a mine – in time, the world-renowned Big Hole|Kimberley Mine. The Cape Colony, South African Republic|Transvaal, Orange Free State and the Griqua people|Griqua leader Nicolaas Waterboer all laid claim to the diamond fields. The Free State Boers in particular wanted the area, as it lay inside the natural borders created by Orange River|Orange and Vaal Rivers. Following the mediation that was overseen by the Governor of Natal Colony|Natal, the Keate Award went in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under British protection. Consequently, the territory known as Griqualand West was proclaimed on 27 October 1871.  Colonial Commissioners arrived in New Rush on 17 November 1871 to exercise authority over the territory on behalf of the Cape Governor. Digger objections and minor riots led to Governor Henry Barkly|Barkly's visit to New Rush in September the following year, when he revealed a plan instead to have Griqualand West proclaimed a Crown Colony. Richard Southey (colonial administrator)|Richard Southey would arrive as Lieutenant-Governor of the intended Crown Colony in January 1873. Months passed however without any sign of the proclamation or of the promised new constitution and provision for representative government. The delay was in London where Secretary of State for the Colonies, John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, insisted that before electoral divisions could be defined, the places had to receive "decent and intelligible names. His Lordship declined to be in any way connected with such a vulgarism as New Rush and as for the Dutch name, "Vooruitzigt" … he could neither spell nor pronounce it." The matter was passed to Southey who gave it to his Colonial Secretary J.B. Currey. Roberts writes that "when it came to renaming New Rush,  proved himself a worthy diplomat. He made quite sure that Lord Kimberley would be able both to spell and pronounce the name of the main electoral division by, as he says, calling it 'after His Lordship'." New Rush became Kimberley, by Proclamation dated 5 July 1873. Digger sentiment was expressed in an editorial in the "Diamond Field" newspaper when it stated "we went to sleep in New Rush and waked up in Kimberley, and so our dream was gone." Following agreement by the British government on compensation to the Orange Free State for its competing land claims, Griqualand West was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1877. The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno initially had serious doubts about annexing the heavily indebted region, but, after striking a deal with the Home Government and receiving assurances that the local population would be consulted in the process, he passed the Griqualand West Annexation Act on 27 July 1877. File:Open pit mine.jpg|thumb|left|The Big Hole.   As miners arrived in their thousands the hill disappeared and subsequently became known as the Big Hole (or "Kimberley se Gat" in Afrikaans) or, more formally, Big Hole|Kimberley Mine. From mid-July 1871 to 1914, 50,000 miners dug the hole with picks and shovels, yielding 2,722&nbsp;kg of diamonds. The Big Hole has a surface of  and is 463 metres wide. It was excavated to a depth of 240&nbsp;m, but then partially infilled with debris reducing its depth to about 215&nbsp;m; since then it has accumulated water to a depth of 40 m leaving 175 m visible. Beneath the surface, the Kimberley Mine underneath the Big Hole was mined to a depth of 1097&nbsp;metres. A popular local myth claims that it is the largest hand-dug hole on the world, however Jagersfontein Mine appears to hold that record. The Big Hole is the principal feature of a May 2004 submission which placed "Kimberley Mines and associated early industries" on UNESCO's World Heritage Tentative Lists., News24 (website)|News24  By 1873 Kimberley was the second largest town in South Africa, having an approximate population of 40,000.   File:BigHole Cocopan.JPG|thumb|right|A sign next to the Big Hole, reading "If all the diamonds recovered from the Kimberley Mine could be gathered together they would fill three Minecart|cocopans such as these" The various smaller mining companies were amalgamated by Cecil Rhodes and Charles Rudd into De Beers, and The Kimberley under Barney Barnato. In 1888, the two companies merged to form De Beers|De Beers Consolidated Mines, which once had a monopoly over the world's diamond market. Very quickly, Kimberley became the largest city in the area, partly due to a massive African migration to the area from all over the continent. The immigrants were accepted with open arms, because the De Beers company was in search of cheap labour to help run the mines. Another group drawn to the city for money was prostitutes, from a wide variety of ethnicities who could be found in bars and saloons. It was praised as a city of limitless opportunity. Five big holes were dug into the earth following the kimberlite pipes, which are named after the town. Kimberlite is a diamond-bearing blue ground that sits below a yellow colored soil. The largest, The Kimberley mine or "Big Hole" covering , reached a depth of  and yielded three tons of diamonds. The mine was closed in 1914, while three of the holesDu Toit's Pan|Dutoitspan, Wesselton and Bultfonteinclosed down in 2005.
