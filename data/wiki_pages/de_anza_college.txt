Each year, De Anza invites several celebrities and dignitaries for public speaking engagements. Construction began in 1968 and the building was dedicated in 1971 as the Calvin C. Flint Center for the Performing Arts, named after the District Superintendent and first Chancellor, The Flint Center also has classrooms and was home to the Film and TV department in its early years. Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh in a 1984 press conference (which was recreated in 2015 for the movie "Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs") and the IMac G3|iMac in 1998.Isaacson, Walter (²2011): "Steve Jobs. Die autorisierte Biografie des Apple-Gründers". München: Bertelsmann, 416. The Foothill DeAnza Board has voted to close the Flint Center and tear it down. The last event in the facility was June 22, 2019.  The mission of the "Euphrat Museum of Art" is to stimulate creativity and an interest in art among audiences of all ages. Hank Baum writes in the "California Art Review":<blockquote>"Established with a bequest by E. F. Euphrat in memory of his wife Helen, the gallery opened its doors in 1977. . .  is also the site for lectures, poetry readings, performances, discussions, and special community events. "In addition, Director Jan Rindfleisch presents exhibits that address philosophical and social issues, challenge taboos, and allow artists to be resurrected who have been obscured by the prejudice of their day. "The wide range of the gallery's interest is reflected in the titles of some past exhibitions 'Commercial Artists: Their Art,' '1981 International Year of Disabled Persons,' Men and Children,' 'The Workplace/The Refuge,' 'Realism in Painting and Color,' ' Survey of Bay Area Sculpture,' "It's Electric, ' ' Art that Rolls and Flies,' and the 'Lyle Tuttle Tattoo Art Collection'."</blockquote>Rita Felciano noted in her review of the 1987 "The Power of Cloth,""The Euphrat... puts together exhibits from the outside—events that usually have some bite to them." In the 1990 "Art around the Bay: a guide to art galleries and museums in the San Francisco Bay Area" Paul Monaco and Murwani Davis write:     The college is the home of the California History Center, housed in a mansion called "Le Petit Trianon".  The Visual and Performing Arts Center opened on March 6, 2009 and was built with an art exhibit and also a 400-seat performance and lecture hall that can be rented by De Anza College organizations and outside community groups.  The Kirsch Center opened in 2005 and was the first community college building in the US to receive a LEED platinum rating. A 17-year effort, the Kirsch Center was conceived and is operated by De Anza faculty, staff and students. Over 100 environmental classes are taught in the Kirsch Center. In addition to classrooms and labs, students can work in self-paced programs at special open study stations throughout the building. A few examples of what the building features are: * Solar panel roof * Advanced natural ventilation * Raised floor for gentle air distribution and flexibility * Natural day lighting * Orientation and layout for energy efficiency and passive solar benefits * Water conservation and water runoff control * Radiant heating and cooling * Native species landscaping The building is a favorite location for policy makers, school officials, student groups, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to visit and utilize for conferences and for tours. The building was a 10 million dollar project that was funded by various groups including the student senate, Morgan Family Foundation, and Steve and Michele Kirsch Foundation.
