   The "cleaning department" takes care of Wikipedia:Maintenance|maintaining pages that require regular updates, archiving and so forth. By sharing the responsibility for these activities, we reduce the amount of work necessary for the individuals. Simply put, volunteers list themselves here for a particular day in the month and pledge to help with the cleaning of a page on that day. Cleaning pages is necessary to keep them well structured and at a reasonable size -- some people have problems editing large pages (which in part can be addressed using Wikipedia:Section|section editing), and higher loading time affects users with slow connections (and bogs down the servers). If you want to join the cleaning department for a particular page, sign your name after a day in the month on which you will check that particular page to help with its maintenance if necessary. == Developers == There are some tasks that not even Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrats can do, but rather, a Wikipedia:Developer|developer is needed.  = * == Bureaucrats == Similarly, there are some things that Wikipedia:Admin|admins cannot do, but need a Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat.     = * == Trash removal == Since ordinary users cannot delete pages, there are a number of places where things are listed for admins to delete them.
