   The ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"", also known as ""Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"" or ""Glory, Glory Hallelujah"" outside of the United States, is a popular American patriotic song written by the abolitionist writer Julia Ward Howe. Howe adapted her song from the popular soldiers’ song "John Brown's Body" in November 1861, and first published them in "The Atlantic Monthly" in February 1862. In contrast to the irreverent lyrics of the soldiers’ song, her version is highly self-righteous, linking the Union cause with God’s vengeance at the Day of Judgment (through allusions to biblical passages such as  and ). Julia Ward Howe was married to Samuel Gridley Howe, a famed scholar in education of the blind.  Both Samuel and Julia were also active leaders in anti-slavery politics and strong supporters of the Union. Samuel Howe was a member of the Secret Six, the group who funded John Brown's work.Reynolds, David S.

Vintage Books, pp. 209–215. ==History==  The tune and some of the lyrics of "John Brown’s Body" came from a much older folk hymn called "Say, Brothers will you Meet Us", also known as "Glory Hallelujah", which has been developed in the camp meeting#Music and hymn singing|oral hymn tradition of revivalist camp meetings of the late 1700s, though it was first published in the early 1800s. In the first known version, "Canaan's Happy Shore," the text includes the verse "Oh! Brothers will you meet me (3×)/On Canaan's happy shore?" and chorus "There we'll shout and give Him glory (3×)/For glory is His own." This developed into the familiar "Glory, glory, hallelujah" chorus by the 1850s. The tune and variants of these words spread across both the southern and northern music of the United States|United States.  At a flag-raising ceremony at Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren, near Boston, Massachusetts, on Sunday, May 12, 1861, the song "John Brown's Body", using the well known "Oh! Brothers" tune and the "Glory, Hallelujah" chorus, was publicly played "perhaps for the first time". The American Civil War had begun the previous month. In 1890, George Kimball wrote his account of how the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the Massachusetts militia, known as the "Tiger" Battalion, collectively worked out the lyrics to "John Brown's Body." Kimball wrote: }} According to Kimball, these sayings became proverb|by-words among the soldiers and, in a communal effort — similar in many ways to the spontaneous composition of camp meeting songs described above — were gradually put to the tune of "Say, Brothers":  And,—  These lines seemed to give general satisfaction, the idea that Brown's soul was "marching on" receiving recognition at once as having a germ of inspiration in it. They were sung over and over again with a great deal of gusto, the "Glory, hallelujah" chorus being always added.}} Some leaders of the battalion, feeling the words were coarse and irreverent, tried to urge the adoption of more fitting lyrics, but to no avail. The lyrics were soon prepared for publication by members of the battalion, together with publisher C. S. Hall. They selected and polished verses they felt appropriate, and may even have enlisted the services of a local poet to help polish and create verses. The official histories of the old First Artillery and of the 55th Artillery (1918) also record the Tiger Battalion's role in creating the John Brown Song, confirming the general thrust of Kimball's version with a few additional details.

Staying at the Willard Hotel in Washington on the night of November 18, 1861, Howe wrote the verses to the "Battle Hymn of the Republic.". See also footnote in "To-Day", 1885 (v.3, Feb),   Of the writing of the lyrics, Howe remembered:  Howe's "Battle Hymn of the Republic" was first published on the front page of "The Atlantic Monthly" of February 1862. The sixth verse written by Howe, which is less commonly sung, was not published at that time.

Both "John Brown" and "Battle Hymn of the Republic" were published in Father Kemp's "Old Folks Concert Tunes" in 1874 and reprinted in 1889. Both songs had the same Chorus with an additional "Glory" in the second line: "Glory! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!"Hall, Roger L. "New England Songster."

"John Brown's Body" has more syllables in its verse and uses a more rhythmically active variation of the "Canaan" melody to accommodate the additional words in the verse. In Howe's lyrics, the words of the verse are packed into a yet longer line, with even more syllables than "John Brown's Body." The verse still uses the same underlying melody as the refrain, but the addition of many dotted rhythms to the underlying melody allows for the more complex verse to fit the same melody as the comparatively short refrain. :"One version of the melody, in C major, begins as below.
