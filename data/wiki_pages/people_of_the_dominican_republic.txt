Dominican is historically the name for the inhabitants of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, the site of the first Spain|Spanish settlement in the Western Hemisphere. The origins of the Dominican Republic, its people and culture consist predominantly in a European culture|European basis, with Taino|Native Taíno and African culture|African influences., Claudio «» Revista Complutense de Historia de América, Universidad Complutense de Madrid. p. 133 (1981) The majority of Dominicans reside in the Dominican Republic, while there is also a large Dominican diaspora, mainly in the United States and Spain. The total population of the Dominican Republic in 2016 was estimated by the National Bureau of Statistics of the Dominican Republic at 10.2 million, with 9.3 million of those being natives of the country, and the rest being of foreign origin. The country has a right of blood citizenship law. ==Name== Historically the Dominican Republic was known as Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo, the name of its Santo Domingo|present capital and its patron saint, Saint Dominic. Hence the residents were called "Dominicanos" (Dominicans). The revolutionaries named their newly independent country "La República Dominicana". It was often referred to as the "Republic of San Domingo" in English language 19th century publications. The first recorded use of the word "Dominican" is found in a letter written by Philip IV of Spain|King Phillip IV of Spain in 1625 to the inhabitants of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo. In this letter, which was written before the arrival of France|French settlers on the Western side of the island, the King congratulates the "Dominicans" for their heroic efforts in defending the territory from an attack by a Netherlands|Dutch fleet. This letter can be found today in the "Archivo General de Indias" in Seville|Seville, Spain. Another name that's been commonly used is "Quisqueyans". In the National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|national anthem of the Dominican Republic the author uses the term "Quisqueyans" instead of "Dominicans". The word "Quisqueya" is derived from a native tongue of the Taino Indigenous People which means, "Great thing", "Big thing", or "Mother of all Lands." It is often used in songs as another name for the country. ==History==   Prior to European colonization, the inhabitants of the island were the Arawakan languages|Arawakan-speaking Taíno, a seafaring people who moved into Hispaniola from the north-east region of South America, displacing earlier inhabitants, c. AD 650. The native Tainos divided the island into several chiefdoms and engaged in farming, fishing, as well as hunting, and gathering. The Spaniards arrived in 1492. Columbus and his crew were the first recorded European ethnic groups|Europeans to encounter the Taíno people. Columbus described the native Taínos as a physically tall and well-proportioned people, with a noble character. After initially amicable relationships, the Taínos fought against the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagaríx, Guamá, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after the 1492 arrival, the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to smallpox, measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans. Census records from 1514 reveal that at least 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women,{{cite journal|last=Ferbel Azcarate|first=Pedro J.|url=http ...
