Gennai was a Pharmacology|pharmacologist, student of "Rangaku", physician, author, painter and inventor well known for his "Elekiter|Erekiteru" (electrostatic generator), "Kandankei" (thermometer), and "Kakanpu" (asbestos cloth). Gennai also composed several works on (Homosexuality in Japan|homosexual) life and desire in Japan, such as the "Nenashigusa" (1763), the "Kiku no en" (1764), the "San no asa" (1768), and the "Nenashigusa kohen" (1768). He also wrote a few satirical essays, including  ""On Farting"" Rootless Grass, and A Lousy Journey of Love. His birth name was Shiraishi Kunitomo, but he later used numerous pen names, including  ,  (his principal literary pen name),  and . He is best known by the name of Hiraga Gennai. == Biography ==   Hiraga Gennai was born in 1729 in the village of Shidoura, Sanuki Province (part of the modern city of Sanuki, Kagawa. He was the third son of Shiraishi Mozaemon (Yoshifusa) a "ashigaru" low-level provincial samurai in the service of the Takamatsu Domain. The Shiraishi clan traced their roots to Saku District, Shinano|Saku District in Shinano Province where they were local warlords with the surname of "Hiraga". However, after they were defeated by the Takeda clan, they fled to Mutsu Province and entered the service of the Date clan, taking the new surname of "Shiraishi" from a location in Mutsu. They accompanied a cadet branch of the Date clan to Uwajima Domain in Shikoku, but eventually moved to Takamatsu where they supplemented their meagre income as a low-ranking samurai with farming. Gennai studied Confucianism and haiku poetry, and crafted "hanging scroll|kakejiku" as a child in Takamatsu.  In 1741, Gennai began his studies as an herbalist and became an apprentice to a physician at the age of 12. Later at the age of 18 Gennai was offered an official position in the herb garden of the local . In 1748, his father died, and he became head of the family.  File:Elekiter replica.jpg|thumb|The "Elekiter" (replica) exhibited in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan.|left = Gennai visited Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki around 1752, where he studied oil painting, western medicine. The western medicine Gennai studied included European pharmaceutical and surgical techniques and other "rangaku" topics. Soon after his return from Nagasaki, he turned the role of head of household over to his sister and abandoned his family. Nagasaki was at the time one of the only ports that foreign ships were allowed to enter and therefore the Dutch East Indies Company (Dutch East Indies Company |VOC) along with a host of Chinese traders resided in the port town, and there were able to do business under highly regulated supervision. The interaction that Gennai had with the Chinese merchants and members of the Dutch East Indies Company |VOC introduced him to ceramics. The following year Gennai relocated to Osaka and Kyoto, where he studied medicinal herbs under Toda Kyokuzan before moving to Edo in 1757. = In Edo, he studied with Tamura Ransui, and with his oversight and support Gennai began to cultivate natural specimens of ginseng. This made the transition from imports of the medicinal herb to domestic production possible. While in Edo Gennai wrote a number of books, some on scientific or nature topics, some satirical novels, in the "kokkeibon" and "dangibon" genres. Gennai was an Homosexuality in Japan|onna-girai and composed several works on the subject, including guidebooks on the male prostitutes of his days and works of fiction exalting sex between men over heterosexuality.In his scientific experiments, Gennai prospected for various minerals, wove asbestos, calculated temperatures, and worked with static electricity. He returned to Nagasaki to study mining and the techniques of refining ores. == In 1761, he discovered iron deposits in Izu Province and worked as a broker to establish a mining venture. He also held exhibitions of his various inventions in Edo, and came to be known to Tanuma Okitsugu, a senior official in the Tokugawa shogunate, as well as the doctors Sugita Genpaku and Nakagawa Jun'an.  In 1766, he assisted Kawagoe Domain to develop an asbestos mine in what is now part of Chichibu, Saitama. While these, he also studied techniques to improve the efficiency of charcoal furnaces and the construction of river boats. In 1772 Gennai was on a trip to Nagasaki and uncovered a store of clay this led to him petitioning the government to allow him to manufacture pottery on a large scale, for both exports and  domestic use.  "If the Japanese ware is good, then naturally we will not spend our gold and silver on the foreign commodity. Rather to the contrary: since both the Chinese and Hollanders will come to seek out these wares and carry them home, this will be of everlasting national benefit. Since it is originally clay, no matter how much pottery we send out, there need be no anxiety about a depletion of resources". Also in 1773, he was invited by Satake Yoshiatsu to Kubota Domain to teach mining engineering, and while in Dewa Province, also gave lessons in western oil painting.

Edo period, 18th century == Gennai made or instructed a number of Japanese pottery pieces which are named "Gennai ware" after him. The style is unique with brilliant colours, mostly three, following the Kōchi ware style from Gennai's native island of Shikoku.  Gennai was back in Edo by the summer of 1779, where he undertook repairs to a "Daimyō" mansion. His final days are surrounded in mystery. The most prevalent account is that he was arrested in late 1779 for killing two carpenters on the project in a drunken rage after they had accused him of stealing the plans for the mansion. He subsequently died in prison on January 24 of then following year of tetanus. Sugita Genpaku wanted to hold a funeral service, but this was denied for unknown reasons by the Shogunate, so Sugita held a memorial service with no body and with no tombstone. This has given rise to many theories over the years that Gennai had not actually died in prison, but had been spirited away, possibly by the intervention of Tanuma Okitsugu, and lived out the rest of his life somewhere in obscurity. ==Grave of Hiraga Gennai== File:Hirara_Gennai_grave_in_Shido.JPG|left|thumb|Hiraga Gennai grave in Shido Despite the original prohibition on his funeral, Hiraga Gennai had a grave at the temple of Sosen-ji in Asakusabashi (currently Hashiba, Taitō-ku, Tokyo) . In 1928, following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the temple was relocated to Itabashi, but its cemetery remained behind. Behind his grave is the grave of Fukusuke, his long-time manservant, and next to the tombstone is a stone monument with an epitaph by Sugita Genpaku, his life-long friend. The tomb was reconstructed by  Count Yorinaga Matsudaira in 1931. It received protection as a Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site in 1943. The site is a 12-minute walk from Minami-Senju Station on the Hibiya Line; however, the grave is not open to the public. In addition, Hiraga has a second grave at the Hiraga family "bodaiji" in Sanuki, Kagawa. ==Works==  Gennai published many works over the course of his literary career. The most well known being "On Farting", a satirical work which aimed at exploring the themes between high and low "Ryōgoku". Within this work Gennai himself is depicted as having a "spirited" debate with a samurai, over a peasant that had become a popular entertainer called a Flatulist|fart-ist. The fart-ist would entertain crowds with their manipulation of "flatulence". Gennai compares the fart-ist in the same category as weightlifters and fire eaters of the "Ryōgoku" district. Within the piece Gennai and his friends debate if a drug is being used by the artist that allows the performance to be possible. Gennai makes the argument that the feat is impressive and commendably unique. Another character, a Confucian Samurai Ishibe Kinkichiro argues that the rudeness of the act and the stupidity of viewers goes against the rules of "Confucian" manners by encouraging something like this to be performed in public. Gennai in the dialogue with Kinkichiro compares conflicting values against one another. For the Confucian samurai the performance in a serious offence against conception of propriety and social order. Where as Ge ...
