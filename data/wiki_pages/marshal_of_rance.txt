The title has been awarded since 1185, though briefly abolished (1793–1804) and for a period dormant (1870–1916). It was one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France during the  and Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration, and one of the Grand Dignitaries of the French Empire|Grand Dignitaries of the Empire during the First French Empire (when the title was Marshal of the Empire, not Marshal of France). A Marshal of France displays seven stars on each shoulder strap. A marshal also receives a Baton (military)|baton – a blue cylinder with stars, formerly fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis during the monarchy and French Imperial Eagle|eagles during the First French Empire. The baton bears the Latin inscription of "", which means "terror in war, ornament in peace". Between the end of the 16th century and the middle of the 19th century, six Marshals of France were given the even more exalted rank of Marshal General of France: , , , , , and . The distinction of Admiral of France is the equivalent in the French Navy.

The title was abolished by the National Convention in 1793. It was restored as Marshal of the Empire during the First French Empire by Napoleon. Under the Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration, the title reverted to Marshal of France, and Napoleon III kept that designation. After the fall of Napoleon III and the Second French Empire, the Third Republic did not use the title until the World War I|First World War, when it was recreated as a military distinction and not a rank. Contrarily to ranks, which are awarded by the army, the distinction of Marshal of France is awarded by a special law voted by the French Parliament. For this reason, it is impossible to demote a Marshal. The most famous case is Philippe Pétain, who was awarded the distinction of Marshal of France for his generalship in World War I, and who was stripped of other positions and titles after his trial for high treason due to his involvement with collaborationist Vichy France: due to the principle of separation of powers, the court that judged him did not have the power to cancel the law that had made him a Marshal in the first place. The last living Marshal of France was Alphonse Juin, promoted in 1952, who died in 1967. The latest Marshal of France was Marie-Pierre Kœnig, who was made a Marshal posthumously in 1984. Today, the title of Marshal of France can only be granted to a general officer who fought victoriously in war-time. ==Direct Capetians==  * Albéric Clément, Lord of Le Mez (died 1191), Marshal of
