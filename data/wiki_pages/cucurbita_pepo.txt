  ""Cucurbita pepo"" is a cultivated plant of the genus "Cucurbita". It yields varieties of winter squash and pumpkin, but the most widespread varieties belong to the subspecies "Cucurbita pepo" subsp. "pepo", called summer squash. It has been domesticated in the Americas for thousands of years. Some authors maintain that "C. pepo" is derived from "Cucurbita texana|C. texana", while others suggest that "C. texana" is merely Feral organism|feral "C. pepo". They have a wide variety of uses, especially as a food source and for medical conditions. "C. pepo" seems more closely related to "Cucurbita fraterna|C. fraterna", though disagreements exist about the exact nature of that connection, too. It is a host species for the Diaphania hyalinata|melonworm moth, the squash vine borer, and the pickleworm. They are also the preferred pollen for squash bees. == History == "C. pepo" is one of the oldest, if not the oldest domesticated species. The oldest known locations are in southern Mexico in Oaxaca 8,000–10,000 years ago and Ocampo, Tamaulipas, Mexico about 7,000 years ago.  Before the arrival of Europeans "C. pepo", along with "C. moschata", had been carried over all parts of North America where they could be grown.Victor E. Boswell and Else Bostelmann. "Our Vegetable Travelers." "The National Geographic Magazine." "96".2: August 1949.  The ancient territory of "C. pepo" extended north into Texas and up the Mississippi River|Greater Mississippi River Valley into Illinois and east to Florida, and possibly even to Maine. It is one of several plants cultivated in prehistoric North America as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. It is known to have appeared in Missouri at least 4,000 years ago. Some varieties grow in arid regions and some in moist regions. Many of these peoples, particularly in the west, still grow a diversity of hardy squashes and pumpkins not to be found in commercial markets.  Still, neither "C. pepo" nor "C. moschata" had been carried into South America as had beans, which originated in the same general region. Debates about the origin of "C. pepo" have been going on since at least 1857. Recent biosystematic investigations indicate two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with "Cucurbita pepo subsp. fraterna" and "Cucurbita pepo subsp. texana", respectively, as the predominant ancestral species from a phylogenetic perspective. == Taxonomy == The Morphology (biology)|morphological differences within the species "C. pepo" are so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species. These vast differences are rooted in its widespread geographic distribution.  Several taxa have been proposed, but as of 2012 none has been universally accepted. In 2002, the taxa conventions proposed by Decker-Walters were: *"C. pepo" subsp. "pepo" - cultivated pumpkins, marrows, the orange gourds ("Orange Ball" and "Orange Warted") *"C. pepo" subsp. "ovifera" var. "ovifera" – cultivated crooknecks, scallops, acorns, most ornamental gourds *"C. pepo" subsp. "ovifera" var. "ozarkana" – wild populations in the Greater Mississippi Valley and Ozark Plateau *"C. pepo" subsp. "ovifera" var. "texana" – wild populations in Texas *"C. pepo" subsp. "fraterna" – wild populations in northeastern Mexico A 2003 study recognized three subspecies: *"Cucurbita pepo" subsp. "fraterna" *"Cucurbita pepo" subsp. "pepo" *"Cucurbita pepo" subsp. "texana" In 1986, botanist Paris proposed a taxonomy of "C. pepo" consisting of eight edible groups based on their basic shape. All but a few "C. pepo" cultivars can be included in these groups. These eight edible cultivated varieties of "C. pepo" vary widely in shape and color, and one inedible cultivated variety: {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! Cultivar group !! Botanical name !!
