File:Pamlicorivermap.png|right|thumb "Pamlico Sound" ( ) is a lagoon in North Carolina which is the largest lagoon along the North American East Coast of the United States|East Coast, extending  long and 15 to 20&nbsp;miles (24 to 32 km) wide. It is part of a large, interconnected network of lagoon estuaries that includes Albemarle Sound, Currituck Sound, Croatan Sound, Roanoke Sound, Pamlico Sound, Bogue Sound, Back Sound, and Core Sound.   Together, these sounds, known as the Albemarle-Pamlico sound system, comprise the second largest estuary in the United States, covering over 3,000 sq. mi. (7,800 km<sup>2</sup>) of open water. (Chesapeake Bay is the largest.) The Pamlico Sound is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Outer Banks, a row of low, sandy bar (landform)|barrier islands that include Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Cape Lookout National Seashore, and Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge. The Albemarle-Pamlico Sound is one of nineteen great waters recognized by the America's Great Waters Coalition. == Hydrology == Pamlico Sound is connected to the north with Albemarle Sound through Channel (geography)|passages provided by the Roanoke Sound and Croatan Sound.  Core Sound is located at the Pamlico's narrow southern end. It is fed by the Neuse River|Neuse and Pamlico River|Pamlico rivers (the latter of which is the estuary of the Tar River) from the west, and from the east by Oregon Inlet, Hatteras Inlet, and Ocracoke Inlet, which also provide passage to the Atlantic Ocean. The salinity of the sound averages 20 Parts-per notation|ppt, compared to an average coastal salinity of 35 ppt in the Atlantic and 3 ppt in the Currituck Sound, which is located north of the Albemarle Sound. The sound and its ocean inlets are noted for wide expanses of shallow water and occasional shoaling, making the area hazardous for larger vessels.  While the deepest hole of the estuary (26'; 8m) can be found in the Pamlico Sound, Outer Banks Catch|url = http://www.outerbankscatch.com/news/blog/2015/02/04/albemarle-pamlico-estuary|website = www.outerbankscatch.com|access-date = 2015-09-29|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930131522/http://www.outerbankscatch.com/news/blog/2015/02/04/albemarle-pamlico-estuary|archive-date = 2015-09-30}} depths generally range from 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8m).  In addition, the shallow waters are susceptible to wind and barometric pressure-driven tidal fluctuations.  This effect is amplified on the tributary rivers, where water levels can change by as much as two feet in three hours when winds are aligned with the rivers' axes and are blowing strongly. == History and current use == In March 1524, Italian Explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano mistook the sound for the Pacific Ocean because of its wide expanse and separation from the Atlantic Ocean by the Outer Banks barrier islands. The sound was named for the Pamlico Native American tribe that lived along the sound's mainland banks and who were referred to as the Pamouik by the Walter Raleigh|Raleigh expeditions (circa 1584).

In 1987, Congress declared the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound an "estuary of national significance."  For vacationers to the Outer Banks, the Pamlico Sound is a "watersports playground" providing opportunities for fishing and crabbing, boating, kayaking, sailing, windsurfing, kiteboarding, parasailing, paddleboarding, and more. In 2012, the economic impact of tourism to the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound area exceeded $1.3 billion. The sound also supports local commercial fishing, crabbing, shrimping, clamming, and oystering. 90% of North Carolina's commercial fishing catches are attributed to the Pamlico Sound, generating almost $100 million per year. == Wildlife == Along the coastal areas are numerous waterfowl nesting sites, including Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge on the Outer Banks, and Swanquarter National Wildlife Refuge on the mainland.
