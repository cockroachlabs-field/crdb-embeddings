File:Roman tile antefix.jpg|thumb|Moulded antefix roof tile showing the badge and standard of Legion XX, from Holt, Clwyd, Wales "Legio XX Valeria Victrix", in English "Twentieth Victorious Valeria Legion" was a Roman legion|legion of the Imperial Roman army. The origin of the Legion's name is unclear and there are various theories, but the legion may have gained its title "Valeria Victrix" from a victory it achieved during the Great Illyrian revolt under the command of the general Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus. The legion had a boar as its emblem. ==History== The legion was probably founded shortly after 31 BC by the emperor Augustus. XX "Valeria victrix" was probably part of the large Roman force that fought in the Cantabrian Wars in Hispania from 25 to 19 BC. The legion then moved to Burnum in Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum at the beginning of the Great Illyrian revolt|Pannonian uprising ("Bellum Batonianum") in AD 6.Velleius Paterculus, "Compendium of Roman History", 2.112.1–2. It is recorded operating against the Marcomanni in AD 6 in the army of Tiberius. In Illyria they were led by the governor of Illyricum, Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus, who may have given his clan ("gens") name "Valeria (gens)|Valeria" to the legion. Although understrength, they managed to defeat the rebels led by Bato I|Bato of the Daesitiates.Velleius Paterculus, 2.112.1-2, Cassius Dio, 55.30.1-5. In one battle the legion cut through the enemy lines, was surrounded, and cut its way out again. After the disaster of Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus in AD 9, XX "Valeria Victrix" moved to Germania Inferior and was based at Oppidum Ubiorum, then moved to Novaesium at the site of modern Neuss during Tiberius' reign. The legion was one of the four, with which Claudius Roman invasion of Britain|invaded Britain in 43 AD. It was also one of the legions that defeated Caratacus at the Battle of Caer Caradoc, after which, from the AD 50s, it was encamped at Camulodunum, with a few units at Kingsholm in Glevum|Gloucester. Around AD 55 under The command of Manlius Valens it moved to Burrium|Usk, in an unsuccessful attempt to pacify the Silures, a tribe very resistant to the imposition of Roman rule in Wales. But the legion suffered defeat, resulting in Valens’ replacement as legate In AD 60 or 61 the Twentieth helped put down the revolt of queen Boudica, after outflanking the Ordovices it took part in the Roman conquest of Anglesey|second Roman invasion of Anglesey which destroyed the Celts|Celtic Druids and their Ancient Celtic religion|religious practices. In AD 66, the legion was transferred to the much more passive Viroconium (Wroxeter).W. H. Manning (2000). "The fortresses of Legio XX". In RJ Brewer (ed.) "Roman Fortresses and Their Legions".

The Legio was stationed in Roman Britain until the beginning of the fifth century In the year of the four emperors, the legion sided with Vitellius. Some units went with him to Rome.  In AD 78–84, the legion was part of Gnaeus Julius Agricola's campaigns in northern Britannia and Caledonia, and built the base at Inchtuthill. In AD 88 the legion returned south and occupied Castra Deva (Deva Victrix), where it remained based for at least two centuries. The Twentieth was among the legions involved with the construction of Hadrian's Wall, and the discovery of stone altars commemorating their work in Caledonia suggests that they had some role in building the Antonine Wall. The legion probably went on campaign in 196 under Decimus Clodius Albinus into Gaul, and would have suffered heavy losses in Gaul before returning to Britain.Mason (2001), pp.&nbsp;155–156. During the Carausian Revolt, which established the Britannic Empire under Carausius and Allectus in the 280s and 290s, the XX "Valeria Victrix" was still active. No further information is known after this period and scholars believe Legio XX was still stationed in Britain when Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine&nbsp;III pulled the bulk of the military forces from there in the year 407 for his doomed campaign on the continent. This legion has been much studied; at least 250 members of the legion have been identified in surviving inscriptions. == Attested members == {| class="wikitable sortable" |- style="vertical-align: top;" !

The movie "Victrix! The Valiant of Albion" is in production and features an adaptation of Stevens' novel. Legio XX "Valeria Victrix" was the legion featured in the novel "Eagle in the Snow"; author Wallace Breem postulates that they were annihilated by the Germanic invasion of 406. Several of the main characters in the early novels of Jack Whyte's "A Dream of Eagles" series were former members of Legio XX "Valeria Victrix". Gaius Petreius Ruso, protagonist of "Medicus" by Ruth Downie, is a military doctor in Britannia attached to Legio XX. Legio XX "Valeria Victrix" lends its name to the character Valeria Matuchek in Poul Anderson's "Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos" and its sequel "Operation Luna"; her mother is said to describe this legion as the last to leave Britain—"the last that stood against Chaos". The first person narrator of Stephen Vincent Benét's short story "The Last of the Legions" is the senior centurion of the "Valeria Victrix", who recounts the events and the impressions of soldiers and populace surrounding the departure of the legion from Britain.
