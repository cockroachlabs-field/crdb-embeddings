She was especially successful in her ventures providing lyrics for Madeleine Dring in "Airs on a Shoestring" (1953), "Pay the Piper" (1954), and "Fresh Airs" (1956), all productions of Laurier Lister. She was once (allegedly) the girlfriend of Peter Sellers, and appeared in "The Goon Show" episodes "Ye Bandit of Sherwood Forest" (1954) as Maid Marian and "Tales of Montmartre" (1956) as Seagoon's love interest, Fifi. Charlotte Mitchell was married to the actor Philip Guard, from whom she separated in 1968, and was the mother of three children: actors Christopher Guard and Dominic Guard and animator and novelist Candy Guard. Charlotte lived in West London during the later part of her life and continued to be active as a poet. }} She appeared on BBC Radio with Ian Carmichael in "The Small, Intricate Life of Gerald C. Potter". Carmichael played Gerald C. Potter, mystery writer, while she played Diana, his wife, who, under the pseudonym of Miss Magnolia Badminton, wrote romantic novels. She also played, on radio, the Dowager Duchess (Lord Peter Wimsey's mother) in the radio adaption of "Strong Poison" that starred Ian Carmichael as Peter Wimsey and the character of Kath Miller in the BBC Radio 2 daily serial "Waggoners' Walk". On television, she played Amy Winthrop the housekeeper in "The Adventures of Black Beauty" (1972–74), and Monica Spencer in And Mother Makes Five. Her poetry was published in collections such as "Twelve Burnt Saucepans", "Looking Round Dangerously", "I Want to Go Home" and "Just in Case". These provided the basis of a series of popular programmes on BBC Radio 4 in which she read her own work.
