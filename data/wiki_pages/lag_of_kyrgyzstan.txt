It is actually a depiction of the first thing one sees when waking up in a yurt, namely the construction of the pinnacle of every Kyrgyz yurt with three  crisscrossing laths across the circular opening at the top of the yurt. Adopted in 1992, just over seven months after the country's independence was declared, to replace the flag of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), it has been the flag of the Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic since that year. The red on the flag is said to be inspired by the pennant lifted by Epic of Manas|Manas, the country's folk hero. ==History== Kyrgyz rebels wielded white banners (named "White Banner of National Liberation") during the Andijan uprising of 1898. Later, during the Central Asian revolt of 1916, they used it again during an uprising in Jizzakh and during an attack on Prebechakenska.Archived at  and the :  Under Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule, the Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic — coterminous with modern-day Kyrgyzstan — utilized a flag derived from the flag of the Soviet Union and Communist symbolism|representing Communism, that was adopted in 1953.  It declared itself independent on 31 August 1991, approximately four months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  Nevertheless, the Soviet-era flag maintained its status as the national flag for seven months after independence was declared.  It was finally replaced by the current design on 3 March 1992, one day after Kyrgyzstan was admitted to the United Nations along with seven other post-Soviet states. <gallery> File:White Banner of National Liberation.png| Shahada Flag used in revolts in 1898 and 1916 File:Flag of the Kirghiz ASSR (1929-1937).svg| Flag of the Kirghiz ASSR (1929–36) File:Flag of the Kyrgyz SSR 1936-1940.svg| Flag of the Kirghiz SSR (1936–40) File:Variant flag of the Kirghiz SSR 1936-1940.svg|  Variant flag of the Kirghiz SSR (1936–40) File:Flag of the Kirghiz SSR 1940-1952.svg| Flag of the Kirghiz SSR (1940–52) File:Flag of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic.svg| Flag of Kirghiz SSR (1952–91) and the flag of Kyrgyz Republic (1991–92) File:Flag of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic (reverse).svg| Flag of Kyrgyz Republic (1992) File:Flag of Kyrgyzstan.svg| Flag of Kyrgyz Republic (1992–present) </gallery> ==Design==  File:Kyrgyz flag yurt Tengri symbol.jpg|thumb|The interior view of a Kyrgyz yurt's roof File:Kyrgyzstan 2011 Flag Proposals Set 5 Flag 2.svg|thumb|One of the proposed national flags from 2011. The colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings.  The red field stands for "bravery and valor", and alludes to the purported emblem hoisted by Epic of Manas|Manas, the folk hero|national hero of Kyrgyzstan.  The sun epitomizes peace and prosperity, while its 40 rays stand for the number of tribes united by Manas to fight against the Mongols, as well as the number of followers he had. The centre of the sun features a stylized illustration of the roof ("tunduk") atop a traditional Kyrgyz tent ("yurt") when viewed from the interior.  Although these tents are less commonly used today, its incorporation into the flag is meant to symbolize the "origin of life", the "unity of time and space", as well as the people's "hearth and home" and their history.  In recent years, a commission was established to examine proposals to modify the design of the flag.  The head of this body observed how it was the object of conflict and disunity,  and that the government did not want this national symbol to be the cause of further division in society.  This partially stemmed from disagreement over the interpretation of the symbols on the current flag.  For instance, modern-day Kyrgyzstan is ethnically diverse, with sizeable minority groups such as the Uzbeks (14.3%) and Dungan people|Dungans (1.1%) living there.  These groups were historically conquered by Manas, and hence, the current flag – inspired by his emblem utilized in war – does not sit well with some of them. The red field has also been the source of much criticism.  Some believe that it evokes the nation's tempestuous history, while others are of the opinion that it is a lingering remnant of Communist Party of Kirghizia|communism in the country.  {| class=wikitable width=60% style="text-align:center;" |- !
