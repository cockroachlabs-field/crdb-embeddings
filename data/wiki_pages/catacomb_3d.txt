   |genre=First-person shooter  |modes=Single-player  |platforms=DOS }} ""Catacomb 3-D"" (also known as ""Catacomb 3-D: A New Dimension"", ""Catacomb 3-D: The Descent"", and ""Catacombs 3"") is a first-person shooter video game, the third in the "Catacomb (video game)|Catacomb" series, the first of which to feature 3D computer graphics. It was developed by id Software and originally published by Softdisk under the Gamer's Edge label, released in November 1991. The player takes control of the high Magician (fantasy)|wizard Petton Everhail, descending into the catacombs of the Towne Cemetery to defeat the evil lich Nemesis and rescue his friend Grelminar. "Catacomb 3-D" is a landmark title in terms of first person (video games)|first-person graphics. It is the first example of the modern, character-based first-person shooter genre, or at least it was a direct ancestor to the games that popularized the genre. It was released for MS-DOS with Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA graphics. The game introduced the concept of showing the player (game)|player's hand in the three-dimensional viewpoint, and an enhanced version of its technology was later used for the more successful "Wolfenstein 3D". The game's more primitive technological predecessor was "Hovertank 3D". ==Production== The origin of the games is "Catacomb (video game)|Catacomb" by John Carmack for the PC and Apple II. This was a 2D computer graphics|two-dimensional game utilizing a third-person view from above, released in 1989â€“1990. It was followed up with "Catacomb II", which used the same game engine with new Level (video gaming)|levels. The first release of "Catacomb 3-D" was called "Catacomb 3-D: A New Dimension", but it was later re-released as "Catacomb 3-D: The Descent", as well as "Catacombs 3" for a re-release as commercially packaged software (the earlier versions had been released by other means such as disk magazines and downloads). The game creators were John Carmack, John Romero, Jason Blochowiak (game programmer|programmers), Tom Hall (game designer|creative director), Adrian Carmack (Game art design|artist), and Bobby Prince|Robert Prince (musician). The game was programmed using the Borland Turbo C++|C++ programming language. Image:Catacomb 3-D The Descent screenshot.png|right|thumb|"Catacomb 3-D" screenshot id Software's use of texture mapping in "Catacomb 3-D" was influenced by "Ultima Underworld" (still in development at "Catacomb 3-D"s release). Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book "Masters of Doom", author David Kushner (writer)|David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between "Underworld" developer Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Paul Neurath has stated multiple times that John Carmack and John Romero had seen the game's 1990 Consumer Electronics Show|CES demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper. =="Catacomb Adventure Series"== "Catacomb 3-D" was followed by three games, in the so-called "Catacomb Adventure Series". They were not developed by id Software but internally by Softdisk with a new staff for Gamer's Edge, who also made the later "Dangerous Dave" sequels. All of the games, including the original "Catacomb (video game)|Catacomb" titles, are now distributed legally by Flat Rock Software through their own web store and via GoG.com. Flat Rock have also released the source code for the games under GNU General Public License|GNU GPL-2.0-or-later in June 2014 in a manner similar John Carmack#Open-source software|those done by id and partners. This has led to the creation of the source port "Reflection Catacomb", also called "Reflection Keen" due to shared support for "Keen Dreams", and ports all of the 3D "Catacomb" games to modern systems. Another project, "CatacombGL", is an enhanced OpenGL port for Microsoft Windows and Linux. The credits for the series are Mike Maynard, James Row, Nolan Martin (programming), Steven Maines (art direction), Carol Ludden, Jerry Jones, Adrian Carmack (art production), James Weiler, Judi Mangham (quality assurance), and id Software (3D imaging effects). The series' development head, Greg Malone, later became creative director for "Duke Nukem 3D" and also worked on "Shadow Warrior" for 3D Realms. Department heads Mike Maynard and Jim Row, meanwhile, would co-found JAM Productions (software)|JAM Productions (soon joined by Jerry Jones), the creators of "Blake Stone" using an enhanced Wolfenstein 3D engine|"Wolfenstein 3D" engine. The series also introduced an item called crystal hourglasses, which would temporarily freeze time and allow the player to stage shots to destroy enemies upon the resumption of normal time, pre-dating later bullet time features in games such as "Requiem: Avenging Angel" and "Max Payne".  "Catacomb Abyss" is the sequel to "Catacomb 3-D", and featured the same main character in a new adventure: since his defeat, some of Nemesis' minions have built a mausoleum in his honour. Fearful of the dark mage's return, the townspeople hire Everhail to descend below and end the evil. The environments are more varied than in "Catacomb 3D", featuring crypts, gardens, mines, aqueducts, volcanic regions and various other locales. It was the only game in the series that was distributed as shareware, released by Softdisk in 1992.

The levels featured, among others, towns, forests, temples, torture chambers, an ant colony, and a crystal maze. It was developed by Softdisk and was later republished by Froggman under the title "Curse of the Catacombs".  "Catacomb Apocalypse" is the final game in the "Catacomb Adventure Series". It was set in the distant future, accessible via time portals, and mixed fantasy and science fiction elements, pitting players against robotic necromancers and the like. It is also the only game in the trilogy to have a hub system, though it was present in the original "Catacomb 3D". It was developed by Softdisk and later republished by Froggman under the title "Terror of the Catacombs". ==Reception== According to John Romero, the team felt it lacked the coolness and fun of Commander Keen, although the 3D technology was interesting to work with. "Computer Gaming World" in May 1993 called "The Catacomb Abyss" "very enjoyable" despite the "minimal" EGA graphics and sound. The magazine stated in February 1994 that "Terror of the Catacombs"s "Playability is good, almost addictive, and offers bang for the buck in spite of its lackluster" EGA graphics. Transend Services Ltd. sold over 1,000 copies of the game in the first month of its release. ==References==            , 3D Realms News, 27 March 2006      }} ==External links== * * * * *    Category:1991 video games Category:DOS games Category:Amiga games Category:Amiga CD32 games Category:First-person shooters Category:Sprite-based first-person shooters Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Wolfenstein 3D engine games Category:Id Software games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Bobby Prince Category:Video games set in cemeteries Category:Softdisk Category:Single-player video games
