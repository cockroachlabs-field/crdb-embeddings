Its name comes from the mythical "Rheint√∂chter" (Rhinemaidens) of Richard Wagner's opera series "Der Ring des Nibelungen". The missile was a multi-stage solid fuelled rocket.Christopher, p.131. It had four small control surfaces, resembling paddles, in the nose, six fins at the after end of the top stage, and four at the end of the main stage. It stood  tall, with a diameter of . The sustainer motor, located ahead of the  warhead (rather than behind, as is more usual) exhausted through six Venturi effect#Venturi tubes|venturis between the first stage fins. == History == "Rheintochter" was ordered in November 1942 by the German army (German Army (Wehrmacht)|"Heer"). Starting in August 1943, 82 test firings were made. An air-launched version was also designed. The operational version was intended to be fired from a ramp or converted gun mount. The project was cancelled on February 6, 1945. Examples are on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, the "Deutsches Museum" in Munich, and at the RAF Museum Cosford, UK == Variants == File:Rheinbote and Rheintochters.jpg|right|thumb|A "Rheintochter" R1 (left), and part of an R3 (centre), with a "Rheinbote" (right) The initial "R1" variant was powered by a two-stage solid-fuel rocket. The proposed "R2" did not offer any improvement over the R1, and was dropped in December 1944. The "R3" model was developed, which had a liquid fuel rocket|liquid fuel engine with solid-fuel boosters ("strap-ons"). Only six trial missiles were fired.Christopher, p.132. == Specifications == * Power plant: RI variant was 2-stage solid fuel; RIII was liquid fuel with solid-fuel boosters * Length: Ford, Brian J., "Secret Weapons", Osprey Publishing, 2011, p.80,  * Diameter: Ford, p.80 * Wing span:  * Launch weight:   * Speed: 1,080&nbsp;km/h (671&nbsp;mph) * Warhead:  <!--type explosive?--> * Altitude: "R1" 8&nbsp;km * Guidance system: Radio Command == See also == * List of World War II guided missiles of Germany * Enzian == Notes ==  == Sources == * Christopher, John.
