It has borders with Chanthaburi province to the northwest, Cambodia to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south. Trat is 315&nbsp;km from Bangkok. Trat is known for gemstone mining and trading. ==Toponymy== "Trat" is believed to be a corruption of "Krat"(กราด) the Thai name for the tree "Dipterocarpus intricatus," common to the region and used to make brooms. It is also spelt Trad. ==History== The history of Trat can be traced back to the early 17th century during the reign of King Prasat Thong of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Formerly known as "Mueang Thung Yai", Trat has played an important role in the development of the country's stability and economy due to its strategic location. The town of Trat later become a community of Chinese merchants. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, Trat served as a checkpoint and buffer city and was responsible for providing provisions to King Taksin the Great before he moved his forces from Chanthaburi town|Chanthaburi to Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya.

Image:OccupationOfTrat1904.jpg|thumb|left|French troops, Trat (1904) In the Rattanakosin era, during the 1893 Paknam crisis, French troops landed and occupied the western part of Chantaburi province. In 1904, Siam was forced to surrender Trat to French Indochina to regain Chantaburi. Three years later, however, finding that Trat with its almost entirely Thai population was hard to rule, the French returned Trat to Thailand on 23 March 1907, in exchange for larger areas along the Mekong river, which included Battambang province|Battambang, Siam Nakhon province|Siam Nakhon, and Banteay Meanchey|Sisophon, which all have a Northern Khmer people|Khmer majority population. During the French-Thai War of 1940–1941, the Vichy France|Vichy French navy sailed from Saigon to seize Trat. The unprepared Thai warships were caught by surprise. By the end of the 17 January 1941 Battle of Ko Chang, three Thai ships had been left sinking: the HTMS "Chonburi", HTMS "Songkhla", and HTMS Thonburi|HTMS "Thonburi". French casualties were light with no ships lost. The Japanese government negotiated a truce, which ended the conflict without further fighting. When the Vietnamese pushed the Khmer Rouge out of Cambodia in 1985, Pol Pot fled to Thailand and made his headquarters in a plantation villa near Trat. It was built for him by the Thai Army and nicknamed "Office 87". ==Geography== The province covers a land area of . The total forest area is  or 31.4 percent of provincial area.
