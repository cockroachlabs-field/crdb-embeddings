"Lossless predictive audio compression (LPAC)" is an improved lossless compression|lossless audio data compression|audio compression algorithm developed by Tilman Liebchen, Marcus Purat and Peter Noll at , Technical University Berlin (TU Berlin), to compress PCM audio in a lossless compression|lossless manner, "unlike" conventional audio compression algorithms which are lossy compression|lossy. Meanwhile, it is no longer developed because an advanced version of it has become an official standard under the name of MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding. == See also == * Monkey's Audio (APE) * Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) * Lossless Transform Audio Compression (LTAC) * TTA (codec)|True Audio (TTA) == External links ==    *    Lossless Audio News & Information Site.
