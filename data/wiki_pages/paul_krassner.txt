He was the founder, editor, and a frequent contributor to the freethought magazine "The Realist", first published in 1958. Krassner became a key figure in the counterculture of the 1960s as a member of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters and a founding member of the Youth International Party|Yippies, a term he is credited with coining. He died on July 21, 2019, in Desert Hot Springs, California. ==Early life== Krassner was a child violin prodigy and performed at Carnegie Hall in 1939, at age six. His parents practiced Judaism,Fred Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum, Fred, , University of California Press, 2009. . but Krassner chose to be firmly secular, considering religion "organized superstition".Krassner, P: "Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut: Misadventures in Counter-Culture",  He majored in journalism at Baruch College (then a branch of the City College of New York) and began performing as a comedian under the name "Paul Maul". He recalled: <blockquote>While in college, I started working for an anti-censorship paper, "Lyle Stuart|The Independent". After I left college I started working there full time. So, I never had a normal job where I had to be interviewed and wear a suit and tie. I became their managing editor and also did freelance stuff for "Mad (magazine)|Mad" magazine. But "Mad" was aimed at a teenage audience, and there was no satirical magazine for adults. So it was a kind of organic evolution toward "The Realist", which was essentially a combination of satire and alternative journalism. </blockquote> During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was active in politically edged humor and satire. Krassner was a founder of the Youth International Party (Yippies) in 1967, even credited with coining the word "Yippie,"  and a member of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, famous for prankster activism. He was a close protégé of the controversial comedian Lenny Bruce, and the editor of Bruce's autobiography, "How to Talk Dirty and Influence People". With the encouragement of Bruce, Krassner started to perform standup comedy in 1961 at the Village Gate in New York. In 1963, he created what Kurt Vonnegut described as <blockquote>"a miracle of compressed intelligence nearly as admirable for potent simplicity, in my opinion, as Einstein's e=mc2." Vonnegut explained: "With the Vietnam War going on, and with its critics discounted and scorned by the government and the mass media, Krassner put on sale a red, white and blue poster that said FUCK COMMUNISM. At the beginning of the 1960s, FUCK was believed to be so full of bad magic as to be unprintable. ... By having FUCK and COMMUNISM fight it out in a single sentence, Krassner wasn't merely being funny as heck. He was demonstrating how preposterous it was for so many people to be responding to both words with such cockamamie Pavlovian fear and alarm.The original  Ep.tcKurt Vonnegut's Foreword to Krassner's "The Winner of the Slow Bicycle Race"</blockquote> In 1971, five years after Lenny Bruce's death, Groucho Marx said, "I predict that in time Paul Krassner will wind up as the only live Lenny Bruce." =="The Realist"==  "The Realist" was published on a fairly regular schedule during the 1960s, then on an irregular schedule after the early 1970s. In 1966, Krassner published "The Realist"s controversial "Disneyland Memorial Orgy" poster, illustrated by Wally Wood, and made this famed black-and-white poster available in a digital color version. Krassner published a red, white and blue poster that read "Fuck Communism", and enclosed copies with an issue of "The Realist". He also mailed one to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover with a note that said "I hope you get a chuckle out of the enclosed patriotic poster." Krassner's hope was that he would be arrested for sending obscene material through the mail, which would allow him to get publicity for his magazine. He was disappointed when no prosecution resulted."The Realist Cartoons", edited by Paul Krassner, p. 9. Krassner's most notorious satire was the article "The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book", which followed the censorship of William Manchester's 1967 book on the John F. Kennedy assassination, "The Death of a President". At the Climax (narrative)|climax of the grotesque-genre short-story, Lyndon B. Johnson is described as having sexually penetrated the bullet-hole wound in the throat of John F. Kennedy's corpse. – "The Realist", Issue No. 74 – May 1967, cover page and  According to Elliot Feldman, "Some members of the mainstream press and other Washington political wonks, including Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame, actually believed this incident to be true.""" by Elliot Feldman In a 1995 interview for the magazine "Adbusters", Krassner commented: "People across the country believed – if only for a moment – that an act of presidential necrophilia had taken place. It worked because Jackie Kennedy had created so much curiosity by censoring the book she authorized – William Manchester's "The Death Of A President" – because what I wrote was a metaphorical truth about LBJ's personality presented in a literary context, and because the imagery was so shocking, it broke through the notion that the war in Vietnam was being conducted by sane men.""" by CAT SIMRILin from "Adbusters Quarterly" Journal of the Mental Environment (Winter 1995 Vol. 3 No. 3). In 1966, he reprinted in "The Realist" an excerpt from the academic journal the "Journal of the American Medical Association", but presenting it as original material. The article dealt with drinking glasses, tennis balls and other foreign bodies found in patients' rectums."" Reprinted from AIGA Journal of Graphic Design, vol.18, no. 2, 2000. Some accused him of having a perverted mind, and a subscriber wrote "I found the article thoroughly repellent. I trust you know what you can do with your magazine." Krassner revived "The Realist" as a much smaller newsletter during the mid-1980s when material from the magazine was collected in "The Best of the Realist: The 60's Most Outrageously Irreverent Magazine" (Running Press, 1985). The final issue of "The Realist" was #146 (Spring, 2001). ==Books== Krassner was a prolific writer. In 1971, he published a collection of his favourite works for "The Realist", as "How A Satirical Editor Became A Yippie Conspirator In Ten Easy Years". In 1981 he published the satirical story "Tales of Tongue Fu", in which the hilarious misadventures of the Japanese-American man Tongue Fu are mixed with a wicked social commentary. In 1994, he published his autobiography "Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut: Misadventures in Counter-Culture". In July 2009, City Lights Publishers released "Who's to Say What's Obscene?", a collection of satirical essays that explore contemporary comedy and obscenity in politics and culture. He published three collections of drug stories. The first collection, "Pot Stories for the Soul" (1999), is from other authors and is about marijuana. "Psychedelic Trips for the Mind" (2001), is written by Krassner himself and collects stories on LSD. The third, "Magic Mushrooms and Other Highs" (2004), is by Krassner too, and deals with Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms, MDMA|ecstasy, peyote, mescaline, Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC, opium, cocaine, ayahuasca, Atropa belladonna|belladonna, ketamine, Phencyclidine|PCP, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|STP, "bufotenin|toad slime", and more. ==Other activities== In 1962 Krassner published an anonymous interview with Robert Spencer (doctor)|Dr Robert Spencer detailing his involvement in illegal but safe abortions. Subsequent to the publication, he received calls from women asking to be put in contact with the interviewee. Krassner was later subpoenaed to appear before grand juries investigating abortion crime. In 1965 he contributed to the Free University of New York a lecture entitled "Why the New York Times is funnier than Mad Magazine". by Roy lisker, accessed 16 July 2012 In 1968, Krassner signed the "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War."Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 "New York Post" In the 1960s, Krassner was a regular contributor to several men's magazines including "Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier" and "Playboy". "Cavalier" hired Krassner for $1,000 per month to write a column called "The Naked Emperor." In 1971, Krassner worked as a weekend radio personality and disk jockey at San Francisco's ABC-FM radio affiliate, KOSF|KSFX, (subsequently KGO-FM). Under the pseudonym "Rumpelforeskin", he satirized culture and politics while espousing his atheism. He was also a contributor to early issues of "Mad (magazine)|Mad magazine". He often appeared as a stand-up comedian, and he was among those featured in the 2005 documentary "The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats".
