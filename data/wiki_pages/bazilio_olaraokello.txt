In 1985, he was briefly the chairman of the ruling Military Council and "de facto" President of Uganda|head of state of Uganda, and later, lieutenant-general and chief of the armed forces. During the Ugandan Bush War|civil war in Uganda between the UNLA (which was now the national army) and Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army, president Milton Obote alienated much of the Acholi people|Acholi-dominated officer corps, including Olara-Okello and General Tito Okello, by appointing his fellow ethnic Langi people|Lango, Brigadier Smith Opon Acak, as army Chief of Staff. On 27 July 1985, an army brigade of the UNLA commanded by Olara-Okello, and composed mostly of Acholi people|Acholi troops, staged a coup d'état against Milton Obote's government and seized power. The National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly was dissolved and a Military Council was established. Between 27 and 29 July 1985, Olara-Okello was Chairman of the Military Council, and "de facto" head of state. On 29 July, General Tito Okello replaced Olara-Okello as Chairman of the Military Council, and Olara-Okello was promoted from the rank of Brigadier to that of Lieutenant General, and named chief of the armed forces. He commanded the army until Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army seized power on 26 January 1986. Olara-Okello fled to exile in Sudan, where he lived until he died in Omdurman Hospital in Khartoum on 9 January 1990. ==See also== *Uganda since 1979, part of the History of Uganda series. *Nairobi Agreement, 1985 *Politics of Uganda *Political parties of Uganda ==References== *, "Library of Congress" *, "The New York Times", August 8, 1985        Category:1929 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Acholi people Category:Presidents of Uganda Category:Ugandan exiles Category:Ugandan military personnel
