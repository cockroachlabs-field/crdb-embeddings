In "That's Not in My American History Book", Thomas Ayres maintains that the official title was "Free Republic of Franklin". was an unrecognized proposed U.S. state|state located in what is today East Tennessee, United States. Franklin was created in 1784 from part of the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been offered by North Carolina as a cession to Continental Congress|Congress to help pay off debts related to the American Revolutionary War|American War for Independence. It was founded with the intent of becoming the 14th state of the new United States. Franklin's first capital was Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesborough. After the summer of 1785, the government of Franklin (which was by then based in Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville), ruled as a "parallel government" running alongside (but not harmoniously with) a re-established North Carolina bureaucracy. Franklin was never admitted into the union. The "extra-legal" state existed for only about four and a half years, ostensibly as a republic, after which North Carolina reassumed full control of the area. The creation of Franklin is novel, in that it resulted from both a cession (an offering from North Carolina to Congress of the Confederation|Congress) and a secession (seceding from North Carolina, when its offer to Congress was not acted upon and the original cession was rescinded). == Concept == The concept of a new western state came from Arthur Campbell (Virginia soldier)|Arthur Campbell of Washington County, Virginia, and John Sevier.  They believed the Overmountain Men|Overmountain towns should be admitted to the United States as a separate state.  They differed, however, on the details of such a state, although John Sevier (in a letter written in 1782) acknowledged Campbell's leadership on the issue.  Campbell's proposed state would have included southwestern Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and parts of Kentucky, Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, and Alabama.  Sevier favored a more limited state, that being the eastern section of the old Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District, which was then part of North Carolina. Although many of the frontiersmen supported the idea, Campbell's calls for the creation of an independent state carved out of parts of Virginia territory caused Virginia governor and Kentucky land speculator Patrick Henry — who opposed a loss of territory for the state — to pass a law that forbade anyone to attempt to create a new state from Virginia by the cession of state territory.  After Virginia Gov. Henry stopped Campbell, Sevier and his followers renamed their proposed state Franklin and sought support for their cause from Benjamin Franklin.  The Frankland movement had little success on the Kentucky frontier, as settlers there wanted their own state (which they achieved in 1792). == Cession and rescission ==  The Confederation Congress|United States Congress was heavily in debt at the close of the American Revolutionary War|American War for Independence. In April 1784, the state of North Carolina voted "to give Congress the About 40 times the size of Rhode Island. lying between the Allegheny Mountains" (as the entire Appalachian range was then called) "and the Mississippi River" to help offset its war debts.Arthur, John Preston (1914);  "History of Western North Carolina – Chapter VI – The State of Franklin"; John Preston Arthur; 1914; (HTML by Jeffrey C. Weaver); October 1998. Retrieved from . This area was a large part of what had been the Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District (usually referred to simply as the "Western Counties"). These western counties had originally been acquired by lease from the Overhill Cherokee, out of which the Watauga Association|Watauga Republic had arisen. The North Carolina cession to the federal government had a stipulation that Congress would have to accept responsibility for the area within two years, which, for various reasons, it was reluctant to do. The cession effectively left the western settlements of North Carolina alone in dealing with the Cherokee of the area, many of whom had not yet made peace with the new nation. These developments were not welcomed by the frontiersmen, who had pushed even further westward, gaining a foothold on the western Cumberland River at Fort Nashborough (now Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville), or the Overmountain Men, many of whom had settled in the area during the days of the old Watauga Republic.Caruso, John A (1959). "The Appalachian Frontier: America's First Surge Westward"; Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis; 1959; Library of Congress Cat. No. 59-7226. Inhabitants of the region feared that the cash-starved federal Congress might even be desperate enough to sell the frontier territory to a competing foreign power (such as France or Spain).  A few months later, a newly elected North Carolina Legislature re-evaluated the situation. Realizing the land could not at that time be used for its intended purpose of paying the debts of Congress and weighing the perceived economic loss of potential real estate opportunities, it rescinded the offer of cession and reasserted its claim to the remote western district.  The North Carolina lawmakers ordered judges to hold court in the western counties and arranged to enroll a brigade of soldiers for defense, appointing John Sevier to form it. == Secessionist movement == File:8FranklinCounties.png|300px|thumb|right|The State of Franklin and its counties Rapidly increasing dissatisfaction with North Carolina's governance led to the frontiersmen's calls to establish a separate, secure, and independent state. On August 23, 1784, delegates from the North Carolina counties of Washington County, Tennessee|Washington (which at the time included present-day Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County), Sullivan County, Tennessee|Sullivan, Spencer (now Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins County) and Greene County, Tennessee|Greene—all of which are in present-day Tennessee—convened in the town of Jonesborough. There, they declared the lands to be independent of the State of North Carolina.Williams, "History of the Lost State of Franklin", p. 30 Leaders were republic|duly elected. John Sevier reluctantly became governor; Landon Carter, speaker of the Senate; William Cage (Tennessee politician)|William Cage, first speaker of the House of Representatives; and David Campbell (judge)|David Campbell, judge of the Superior Court. Thomas Talbot served as Senate clerk, while Thomas Chapman served as clerk of the House. The delegates were called to a constitutional convention held at Jonesborough in December of that year.  They drafted a constitution that excluded lawyers, doctors, and preachers as candidates for election to the legislature. The constitution was defeated in referendum. Afterward, the area continued to operate under tenets of the North Carolina state constitution. == Attempt at statehood == On May 16, 1785, a delegation submitted a petition for U.S. state|statehood to Congress of the Confederation|Congress.  Eventually, seven states voted to admit what would have been the 14th federal state under the proposed name of "Frankland". This was, however, less than the two-thirds absolute majority|majority required under the Articles of Confederation to add additional states to the confederation.  The following month, the Franklin government convened to address their options and to replace the vacancy at speaker of the House, to which position they elected Joseph Hardin, Sr.|Joseph Hardin.  In an attempt to curry favor for their cause, delegation leaders changed the "official" name of the area to "Franklin" (ostensibly after Benjamin Franklin).  Sevier even tried to persuade Franklin to support their cause by letter, but he declined, writing:  }} == Independent republic == File:Capitol-replica-greeneville-tn1.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Replica of the Capitol of the State of Franklin in Greeneville, Tennessee  Franklin, still at odds with North Carolina over taxation, protection, and other issues, began operating as a "de facto" independent republic after the failed statehood attempt.  Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville was declared the new capital.  The government had previously been assembling at Jonesborough, only blocks away from the North Carolina-backed rival seat of government.  The first legislature met in Greeneville in December 1785.  The delegates adopted a permanent constitution, known as the Holston Constitution, which was modeled closely upon that of North Carolina.  John Sevier also proposed to commission a Franklin state flag, but it was never designed. Franklin opened courts, incorporated and annexed five new counties (see map below), and fixed taxes and officers' salaries.  Barter became the economic system "de jure", with anything in common use among the people allowed in payment to settle debts, including corn, tobacco, apple brandy, and skins.  (Sevier was often paid in deer hides.)   Federal or foreign currencies were accepted.  All citizens were granted a two-year reprieve on paying taxes, but the lack of hard currency and economic infrastructure slowed development and often created confusion.   The new legislature made peace treaties with the Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes in the area (with few exceptions, the most notable being the Chickamauga Cherokee).  The Cherokee claim to sovereignty over much of the area of southern Franklin, though already occupied by Whites, was maintained at the 1785 Treaty of Hopewell with the federal government.  In 1786, Samuel Wear helped negotiate the competing Cherokee–American wars#Treaty of Coyatee|Treaty of Coyatee on behalf of the State of Franklin. Coyatee re-affirmed the 1785 Cherokee treaties|Treaty of Dumplin Creek, which the republic had secured from the Cherokee, and which Dragging Canoe's Chickamauga faction had refused to recognize.  The new treaty exten ...
