It lived on the island of Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues and surrounding islands and typically dwelt on trees. The Rodrigues giant day gecko fed on insects and nectar, and, unlike most other day geckos, was apparently nocturnal in habit. ==Description== File:Phelsuma gigas.jpg|thumb|left|Bones "Phelsuma gigas" was one of the largest known geckoes.

The tail had some striping and was charcoal- or dark grey-coloured. The tongue had a pink colour and the ventral side of the body was light yellow. The original collected specimens that were used to describe this species have been lost. Today, only a few portions of some skeletons remain. ==Behaviour== Leguat described the species: }} ==Distribution== This species inhabited Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues and surrounding islands. "P. gigas" was last collected in 1842 on the offshore islet of Ile aux Fregates. ==Habitat== "P. gigas" was an arboreal lizard living on trees within the forests of Rodrigues.  "P. gigas" became extinct due to human-induced deforestation and predation by introduced cats and black rat|rats. ==Diet== These day geckos fed on various insects and other invertebrates.
