Luthuli was born to a Zulu family in 1898 at a Seventh-day Adventist mission station|mission in Bulawayo, Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He returned to his family's ancestral home of Groutville in 1908 to attend school under the care of his uncle. After graduating from high school with a teaching degree, Luthuli became principal of a small school in Natal Province|Natal where he was the sole teacher. Luthuli's teaching was recognized by the government, and he was offered a bursary to study for the Higher Teacher's Diploma at Adams College. After the completion of his studies in 1922, he accepted a teaching position at Adam's College where he was one of the first African teachers. In 1928, he became the secretary of the Natal Native Teachers' Association, then its president in 1933. Luthuli's first entry into South African politics and the internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement started in 1935 when he was elected Tribal chief|chief of the Umvoti River Reserve in Groutville. As chief, he was exposed to the injustices facing many Africans due to the South African government's increasingly segregationist policies. This segregation would later evolve into apartheid, a form of institutionalized racial segregation following the National Party (South Africa)|National Party's 1948 South African general election|election victory in 1948. Luthuli joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944 and was elected the provincial president of the Province of Natal|Natal branch in 1951. A year later in 1952, Luthuli led the Defiance Campaign to protest the pass laws and other laws of apartheid. As a result, the government removed him from his chief position as he refused to choose between being a member of the ANC or a chief at Groutville. In the same year, he was elected President of the African National Congress|President-General of the ANC. After the Sharpeville massacre, where sixty-nine Africans were killed, leaders within the ANC such as Nelson Mandela believed the organization should take up armed resistance against the government. Luthuli was against the use of violence, but as time passed, he gradually accepted it; however, he stayed committed to nonviolence on a personal level. Following four List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid|banning orders, the political prisoners|imprisonment and exile of his political allies, and the banning of the ANC, Luthuli's power as President-General gradually waned. The subsequent creation of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's paramilitary wing, marked the anti-apartheid movement's shift from nonviolence to an armed struggle. Inspired by his Christian faith and the nonviolent methods used by Gandhi, Luthuli was praised for his dedication to nonviolent resistance against apartheid as well as his vision of a non-racialism|non-racial South African society. In 1961, Luthuli was awarded the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in leading the nonviolent internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement. Luthuli's supporters brand him as a global icon of peace similar to Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr, the latter of which claimed to be a follower and admirer of Luthuli. He formed Congress Alliance|multi-racial alliances with the South African Indian Congress and the white South African Congress of Democrats|Congress of Democrats, which drew frequent backlash from African nationalism|Africanists in the ANC. The Africanist bloc believed that Africans should not ally themselves with other races due to them being the most disadvantaged race under apartheid. This schism led to the creation of the Pan-Africanist Congress led by Robert Sobukwe. == Early life == File:Aerial view of Solusi Adventist University.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Aerial photograph of a university in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.|The former site of Solusi Mission Station, which is now Solusi University. Albert Luthuli was born at the Solusi Mission Station, a Seventh-day Adventist missionary station, in 1898}} to John and Mtonya Luthuli (Birth name|née Gumede) who had settled in the Bulawayo area of Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He was the youngest of three children and had two brothers, Alfred Nsusana and Mpangwa, who died at birth. Luthuli's father died when he was about six months old, and Luthuli had no recollection of him. His father's death led to him being mainly raised by his mother Mtonya, who had spent her childhood in the royal household of Cetshwayo|King Cetshwayo in Zulu Kingdom|Zululand. Before her marriage to John Luthuli, Mtonya became a Christian, lived within the precincts of the American Board Mission, where she learned how to read, and was a devoted reader of the Bible. After their marriage, Luthuli's father left Colony of Natal|Natal and went to Rhodesia during the Second Matabele War to serve in some capacity with the British South African Company|Rhodesian forces. When the war ended, John stayed in Rhodesia, attached to a Seventh-day Adventist mission near Bulawayo as an interpreter and evangelism|evangelist. Mtonya and Alfred then traveled to Rhodesia to reunite with John, where Luthuli was born soon after. Luthuli's lineage is often traced back to his paternal grandparents Ntaba ka Madunjini and Titsi Mthethwa, who were born in the early nineteenth century and were among the first converts of Aldin Grout, a missionary from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABM), which was based near the Umvoti River north of Durban. Ntaba and Titsi were one of the many Africans that resisted incorporation into the Zulu state founded by Shaka. In 1860, the Umvoti community, known as the abasemakholweni (Conversion to Christianity|converted Christians), elected Ntaba as tribal chief|chief, beginning a family tradition that followed Ntaba's brother, son Martin, and grandson Albert.  File:Groutville Church.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photo of 13 Christian Zulu men seated outside of a church|Pastor and Deacons at a Groutville Church in 1900 Around 1908 or 1909, the Seventh-day Adventists wanted to begin missionary activities in Colony of Natal|Natal. They asked Luthuli's brother, Alfred, to return to work as an interpreter. Luthuli and his mother followed, and left Rhodesia to return to South Africa. Luthuli would stay in the Vryheid district of Northern Natal, where they lived on a farm of a Seventh-day Adventist. As there was no school, Luthuli would tend the mule|mules of the missionaries until his mother sent him to be educated in Groutville under the care of his uncle. Groutville was a small community of Christian peasant farmers and was attached to the mission station of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABM). The ABM was a Congregationalist mission that began their work in Southern Africa in the 1830s. Missionary Aldin Grout began his mission in the village of Umvoti; after his death in 1894 it would be renamed Groutville in his honor. Albert joined the household of his uncle, Chief Martin Luthuli. Martin was the first democratically elected chief of Groutville. Outside of his chieftaincy, Martin founded the Natal Native Congress in 1901, and in 1912 he took part in the founding of the South African Native National Congress (now the African National Congress). As chief, Martin was guardian over many relatives and children, which led to Luthuli having a pleasant childhood with friends of his own age. In Martin's Zulus|Zulu and Christian household, Luthuli would perform duties expected of a boy in traditional Zulu society such as fetching water, herding, and building fires. He would also go to school for the first time. Under Martin's care, Luthuli was also provided with an early knowledge of traditional African politics and affairs, which aided him in his future career as a traditional chief.

Luthuli's mother, Mtonya, returned to Groutville and Luthuli returned to her care. They lived in a brand-new house built by his brother, Alfred, on the site where their grandfather, Ntaba, had once lived. In order to be able to send her son to boarding school, Mtonya worked long hours in the fields of the land she owned. She would also take in laundry from European families in the township of Stanger to earn the necessary money for school. Luthuli was then able to go to the Ohlange High School|Ohlange Institute after he had passed Standard 4 at the ABM mission school in 1914. Ohlange was founded by John Dube|Dr. John Dube, who was the head teacher|school principal at the time Luthuli attended. Dube was educated in America but returned to South Africa to open the Ohlange Institute to provide an education to black children. He was the first President-General of the South African Native National Congress and founded the first Zulu language|Zulu-language newspaper Ilanga lase Natal. Luthuli joined the ANC in 1944, partially out of respect to his former school principal. Luthuli describes his time at Ohlange as "rough-and-tumble" due to the outbreak of World War I; rationing and wartime conditions brought a shortage of food to the African population. This shortage reached the Ohlange Institute and there was a frequent scarcity of food. After attending Ohlange for only two terms, Luthuli was then transferred to Edendale, a Methodist institution near Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Province of Natal|Natal. It was at Edendale where Luthuli participated in his first act of civil disobedience. Along with other students, he joined a student protest|student strike and stay-away to protest against a form of school discipline|punishment implemented by a teacher who would make boys carry heavy stones a long distance. This would then damage their school uniforms|uniforms, which many could not afford. The demonstration failed and Luthuli along with the rest of the strikers were punished by the school. At Edendale, Luthuli developed a passion for teaching and went on to graduate with a teaching degree in 1917.  File:Albert Lutuli.png|thumb|upright|left|Albert Luthuli around 1920. Around the age of nineteen years old, Luthuli's first job after graduation came as a principal at a rural middle school|intermediate school in Blaauwbosch, located in the Province of Natal|Natal midlands. The school was small, and Luthuli was the sole teacher working there. While teaching at Blaauwbosch, Luthuli lived with a Methodism|Methodist's family. As there were no Congregational church|Congregational churches around him, he became the student of a local Methodist Minister (Christianity)|minister, the The Reverend|Reverend Mthembu. He was confirmed in the Methodist church and later became a lay preacher. Luthuli proved himself to be a good teacher and the Natal Department of Education offered him a bursary in 1920 to study for a Higher Teacher's Diploma at Adams College. Following the completion of his two years of study at Adams College, he was offered another bursary, this time to study at the University of Fort Hare in the Cape Province|Eastern Cape. He refused, as he wanted to earn a salary to take care of his ageing mother, which led him to accept a teaching position at Adams College where he and Z. K. Matthews were one of the first African teachers at the school. At Adams College, Luthuli would teach Zulu people|Zulu history, Zulu music|music, and literature. It was also at Adams College where Luthuli would meet his future wife, Nokukhanya Bhengu, a fellow teacher and the granddaughter of a Zulu chief. Luthuli was dedicated to bringing quality ed ...
