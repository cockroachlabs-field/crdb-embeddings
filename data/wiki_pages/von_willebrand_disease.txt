An acquired form can sometimes result from other medical conditions. It arises from a deficiency in the quality or quantity of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a Protein subunit|multimeric protein that is required for platelet platelet#Adhesion|adhesion. It is known to affect several breeds of dogs as well as humans. The three forms of VWD are hereditary, acquired, and pseudo or platelet type. The three types of hereditary VWD are VWD type 1, VWD type 2, and VWD type 3. Type 2 contains various subtypes. Platelet type VWD is also an inherited condition. In 2008 a new diagnostic category of "Low VWF" was proposed to include those individuals whose von Willebrand factor levels were below the normal reference range but not low enough to be von Willebrand disease (levels in the 30-50 IU/dL range).  Patients with low VWF can experience bleeding, despite mild reductions in VWF levels. VWD type 1 is the most common type of the disorder, with mild bleeding symptoms such as epistaxis|nosebleeds, though occasionally more severe symptoms can occur. Blood type can affect the presentation and severity of symptoms of VWD. VWD type 2 is the second most common type of the disorder and has mild to moderate symptoms. The factor is named after the Finnish physician Erik Adolf von Willebrand who first described the condition in 1926. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of VWD were updated in 2021.  ==Signs and symptoms== The various types of VWD present with varying degrees of bleeding tendency, usually in the form of easy bruise|bruising, nosebleeds, and bleeding on probing|bleeding gums. Women may experience menorrhagia|heavy menstrual periods and hemorrage|blood loss during childbirth#Maternal complications|childbirth. Severe internal bleeding and hemarthrosis|bleeding into joints are uncommon in all but the most severe type, VWD type 3. ==Genetics== The VWF gene is located on the locus (genetics)|short arm "p" of Chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12 (12p13.2). It has 52 exons spanning 178kilobase|kbp. Types 1 and 2 are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Occasionally, type 2 also inherits recessively. Type 3 is inherited as autosomal recessive. However, some individuals heterozygous for type 3 may be diagnosed with VWD type 1, indicating an intermediate inheritance in that cases. VWD  occurs in approximately 1% of the population and affects men and women equally.  Genetic testing is typically not part of the initial workup for von Willebrand disease, and is not needed for people diagnosed with type 1 VWD based on clinical history and laboratory tests. It is mainly useful for: * Evaluating family members of individuals who have known variants. * Differentiating between type 2B and platelet-type VWD, as well as between type 2N VWD and hemophilia A. ==Pathophysiology==  Von Willebrand factor is mainly active in conditions of high blood flow and shear stress. Deficiency of VWF, therefore, shows primarily in organs with extensive capillary|small vessels, such as human skin|skin, Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract, and uterus. In angiodysplasia, a form of telangiectasia of the large intestine#Structure|colon, shear stress is much higher than in average capillary|capillaries, and the risk of bleeding is increased concomitantly. In more severe cases of type 1 VWD, genetic changes are common within the VWF gene and are highly Penetrance|penetrant. In milder cases of type 1 VWD, a complex spectrum of molecular pathology may exist in addition to Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms of the VWF gene alone. The individual's ABO blood group system#Bleeding and thrombosis (von Willebrand factor)|ABO blood group can influence presentation and pathology of VWD. Those individuals with blood type|blood group O have a lower mean level than individuals with other blood groups. Unless ABO group-specific VWF:antigen reference ranges are used, normal group O individuals can be diagnosed as type I VWD, and some individuals of blood group AB with a genetic defect of VWF may have the diagnosis overlooked because VWF levels are elevated due to blood group. ==Diagnosis== Basic tests performed in any patient with bleeding problems are a complete blood count-CBC (especially platelet counts), APTT|activated partial thromboplastin time-APTT, prothrombin time with International Normalized Ratio-PTINR, thrombin time-TT, and fibrinogen level. Patients with abnormal tests typically undergo further testing for hemophilias. Other coagulation factor assays may be performed depending on the results of a coagulation screen. Patients with von Willebrand disease typically display a normal prothrombin time and a variable prolongation of partial thromboplastin time. When VWD is suspected, blood plasma of a patient must be investigated for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of VWF.  This is achieved by measuring the amount of VWF in a VWF antigen assay and the functionality of VWF with a glycoprotein (GP)Ib binding assay, a collagen binding assay, or a ristocetin cofactor activity (RiCof) or ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination (RIPA) assays. Factor VIII levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to VWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of VWF can then lead to a reduction in factor VIII levels, which explains the elevation in PTT. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of VWD, particularly type 2, which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow, a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most medical laboratory|medical laboratories. A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used:  A PFA-100|platelet function assay  may give an abnormal collagen/epinephrine closure time, and in most cases, a normal collagen/adenosine diphosphate|ADP time. Type 2N may be considered if factor VIII levels are disproportionately low, but confirmation requires a "factor VIII binding" assay. Additional laboratory tests that help classify sub-types of VWD include von Willebrand multimer analysis, modified ristocetin induced platelet aggregation assay and VWF propeptide to VWF propeptide antigen ratio. In cases of suspected acquired von Willebrand syndrome, a mixing study (analysis of patient plasma along with pooled normal plasma/PNP and a mixture of the two tested immediately, at one hour, and at two hours) should be performed. Detection of VWD is complicated by VWF being an acute-phase reactant with levels rising in infection, pregnancy, and stress. The testing for VWD can be influenced by laboratory procedures. Numerous variables exist in the testing procedure that may affect the validity of the test results and may result in a missed or erroneous diagnosis. The chance of procedural errors are typically greatest during the preanalytical phase (during  collecting storage and transportation of the specimen) especially when the testing is contracted to an outside facility and the specimen is frozen and transported long distances.Christine A. Lee, Rezan A. Kadir, Peter A. Kouides: Inherited Bleeding Disorders in Women P.,  Diagnostic errors are not uncommon, and the rate of testing proficiency varies amongst laboratories, with error rates ranging from 7 to 22% in some studies to as high as 60% in cases of misclassification of VWD subtype. To increase the probability of a proper diagnosis, testing should be done at a facility with immediate on-site processing in a specialized coagulation laboratory.
