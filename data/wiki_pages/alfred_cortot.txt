A pianist of massive repertory, he was especially valued for his poetic insight into Romantic music|Romantic piano works, particularly those of Frédéric Chopin|Chopin, César Franck|Franck, Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns and Robert Schumann|Schumann. For Éditions Durand, he edited editions of almost all piano music by Chopin, Liszt and Schumann. A central figure of the French musical culture in his time, he was well known for his piano trio with violinist Jacques Thibaud and cellist Pablo Casals. ==Biography==  Cortot was born in Nyon, Vaud, in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, to a French father and a Swiss mother. His first cousin was the composer Edgard Varèse.Varèse, Edgard; Jolivet, André (2002). Jolivet-Erlih, Christine, ed. Correspondance 1931–1965 (in French). Contrechamps. p. 110 He studied at the Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire with Émile Decombes (a student of Frédéric Chopin), and with Louis Diémer, taking a "premier prix" in 1896. He made his debut at the Concerts Colonne in 1897, playing Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 3. Between 1898 and 1901 he was a choral coach and subsequently an assistant conductor at the Bayreuth Festival. In 1902 he conducted the Paris premiere of Richard Wagner|Wagner's music drama "Götterdämmerung ("The Twilight of the Gods). He formed a concert society named "Société des Concerts" French pianist|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Denis-Cortot|access-date=2021-08-28|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} to perform Wagner's "Parsifal", Beethoven's "Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis", Johannes Brahms|Brahms' "A German Requiem (Brahms)|German Requiem", and new works by French composers.   file:Calo 1910 12 10 1 8cm BLOG.jpg|thumb|In concert with Spéranza Calo-Séailles  In 1905, Cortot formed a trio with Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals, which established itself as the leading piano trio of its era. In 1907, he was appointed Professor by Gabriel Fauré at the Conservatoire de Paris, replacing Raoul Pugno. He continued to teach at the Paris Conservatoire until 1923, where his pupils included Yvonne Lefébure, Vlado Perlemuter, Simone Plé-Caussade, Magdeleine Brard, Marguerite Monnot, and Rodica Sutzu. In 1919, Cortot founded the École Normale de Musique de Paris. His courses in musical interpretation were legendary.

The French government sponsored two promotional tours to the United States and one to the Soviet Union in 1920. He conducted several orchestras and was often called upon to provide piano accompaniment for touring artists when in Paris. He was involved in music until his health failed, and taught master classes in piano in his advanced years. On 21 March 1925, Cortot made the world's first commercial electrical recording of classical music for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey: List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin by genre#Impromptus|Chopin's Impromptus and Schubert's Litanei, issued on Victor's RCA Red Seal|Red Seal label.40,000 Years of Music: Man in Search of Music - 144 Jacques Chailley - 1964 "On March 21st, 1925, Alfred Cortot made for the Victor Co., in Camden, New Jersey, the first classical recording to employ a new technique, thanks to which the gramophone was to play an important part in musical life: electric ..."  During World War II, he accepted the position of "Haut-Commissaire" ("High Commissioner") for arts in the Vichy France|Vichy government and served twice (1941 and 1942) as a member of the Vichy's "Conseil national" ("National Council") , accessed 13 January 2018.David Dubal booklet to Nimbus Records release of Duo-Art piano rolls "France The Dark Years 1940–1944" by Julian T. Jackson, published in 2003 by Oxford University Press. However, before this he took a strong stance in defending the French music tradition with the Beaux Arts administration (Fine Arts) supporting soldiers with music. Cortot had to leave this position after Philippe Pétain|Pétain's appointment and exerted his energy instead into writing reports about cultural propaganda and defending French musical styles. He was charged with musical reform by the Pétain government, and the Vichy took control of musical activities. He became part of the" comité d’organisation professionelle de la musique (The committee for the professional organisation of music)" in 1942 and worked with Pierre Laval|Laval and Pétain. In 1941 he participated in a "German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Propaganda Staffel" (Propaganda Squad) festival in Paris, and in 1942 played with Wilhelm Kempff for Nazi artist Arno Breker's art exposition, later meeting with Breker at Paul Morand's home. Pierre Laval was also present. Morand had a statue made of Cortot after his impression. He participated in official concerts in Paris during the occupation as well as in Germany in 1942. Daisy Fancourt writes:  After the war's conclusion, Cortot was found guilty by a French government panel of Collaboration with the Axis powers|collaboration with the enemy and was suspended from performing for a year.Chimènes, Myriam, 'Alfred Cortot et la politique musicale du gouvernement de Vichy' in "La vie musicale sous Vichy", ed Chimènes (2001)  , reviewed by Nigel Simeone,  (2001) He said in his defence, "I’ve given 50 years of my life to the helping the French cause  when I was asked to become involved with the interests of my comrades, I felt I couldn’t refuse.  I represented the interests of the French government less than the interests of France.  I have never been involved in politics." Once the suspension expired he returned to performing more than 100 concerts a season.  Cortot died on 15 June 1962, aged 84, of uremia from kidney failure in Lausanne, Switzerland. ==Contribution== As one of the most celebrated piano interpreters of Chopin, Schumann and Debussy, Cortot produced printed editions of the piano works of all three, notable for their inclusion of meticulous commentary on technical problems and matters of interpretation. Cortot suffered from memory lapses in concert (particularly notable from the 1940s onwards) and often left wrong notes on his later records. When in form, however, he showed a brilliant technique that could handle almost any kind of pianistic firework. This gift is evident in his legendary recordings of Liszt's Piano Sonata (Liszt)|Sonata in B minor (the first recording ever made of this masterwork) and Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns' "Etude en forme de valse". The latter thoroughly impressed even Vladimir Horowitz, who - according to Cortot - approached Cortot to learn his "secret" in performing it; Cortot, however, did not divulge it to him. He also wrote a good deal of didactic prose, including a piano primer: "Rational Principles of Pianoforte Technique". This book contains many finger exercises to aid in the development of various aspects of piano playing technique. ==Bibliography== * Cortot, Alfred, "La musique française de piano", 1930–48 * —, "Cours d’interprétation", 1934 ("Studies in Musical Interpretation", 1937) * —, "Aspects de Chopin", 1949 ("In Search of Chopin", 1951) * —, "Grundbegriffe der Klaviertechnik", 1928 ==Notes==  ==References==  ==Sources== * Bernard Gavoty|Gavoty, Bernard, "Alfred Cortot", 1977 (in French) * Manshardt, Thomas, "Aspects of Cortot", 1994 ==External links==  *  housed at the University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections Research Center ;Recordings * () * () * ()    Category:1877 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Nyon Category:20th-century French male classical pianists Category:French male conductors (music) Category:Piano pedagogues Category:People of Vichy France Category:French collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Academic staff of the École Normale de Musique de Paris Category:Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society Category:Academic staff of Lausanne Conservatory Category:Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists Category:Order of the Francisque recipients Category:Mannes College The New School for Music faculty
