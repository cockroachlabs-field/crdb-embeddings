They were at the forefront of the psychedelic music trend, beginning in 1966. They are best known for the hit song "(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet". ==History==  The band was formed in 1964 as The Trenchcoats.  The original members were Emil "Peppy" Thielhelm  "Peppy" Castro (vocals and guitar), Dennis LePore (lead guitar), Ralph Scala (organ and vocals), Ron Gilbert (bass) and Jon Finnegan (drums). The band made a name for itself in various clubs in Greenwich Village. The band changed its name first to the Bloos Magoos and by 1966 to the Blues Magoos. Mike Esposito joined as lead guitarist and Geoff Daking as drummer. The band's single "So I'm Wrong and You Are Right" b/w "The People Had No Faces" on Verve Records (both Rick Shorter compositions) did not gain the band much recognition. In late 1966, Mercury Records signed the band to a record deal and the group's debut album, "Psychedelic Lollipop", was released shortly thereafter – following the 1966 trend to include the word "psychedelic" on the sleeve (after the 13th Floor Elevators' "The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators", and The Deep (band)|The Deep's "Psychedelic Moods", both also from 1966). They played often at the Chess Mate Coffeehouse, a mostly folk venue in Detroit owned by Morrie Widenbaum that also hosted bands such as Southbound Freeway and Siegel-Schwall Band|Siegel-Schwall Blues Band.  In a tour of the US in 1967 the Blues Magoos were the opening act, followed by The Who and the headliners Herman's Hermits. The group's most successful song was "(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet," which reached number 5 on the U.S. charts, and number 4 in Canada. The next single by the Blues Magoos was "There's A Chance We Can Make It". By 1967, they appeared on several network television programs including two Dick Clark–produced series, "Where The Action Is" and "American Bandstand". They also made visits to "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour", performing "Pipe Dream," and a "Kraft Music Hall" hosted by Jack Benny. "One by One" was the band's last single to make the charts. The two albums released after "Psychedelic Lollipop" ("Electric Comic Book" and "Basic Blues Magoos") were not successful. By 1968, the band split up. The band was signed to ABC Records, but only Castro agreed to continue and started up a revamped Blues Magoos, with Eric Kaz, Richie Dickon, John Leillo and Roger Eaton.  The other Blues Magoos moved to the west coast, enlisted Ted Munda, and released the "Let Your Love Ride" b/w "Who Do You Love" single on Ganim Records in 1969 before replacing Munda with Joey Stec, formerly of The Millennium (band)|The Millennium, and then eventually going their separate ways. Ralph Scala and Joey Stec later played in The Dependables. In 1969, the Castro-led band completed "Never Goin' Back To Georgia".  Eaton left the band, and the other Blues Magoos used session musicians for the follow-up "Gulf Coast Bound". After two further years the band was dissolved.  After a stint with the rock musical "Hair (musical)|Hair" and recording with Mercury label mate Exuma (musician)|Exuma (Tony McKay), Peppy Castro formed Barnaby Bye with fellow cast members Bobby and Billy Alessi. The group released two albums on Atlantic Records, "Room to Grow" (1972) and "Touch" (1973). In 1981, Castro resurfaced again with the group Balance (band)|Balance whose song "Breaking Away" reached No.&nbsp;22 on the Billboard Hot 100|"Billboard" Hot 100 chart.  In July 2008, the Blues Magoos with original members Ralph Scala, Castro and Geoff Daking reunited for the first time in years for two concerts, including one with The Zombies at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza in New York City. In December 2009 they traveled to Spain for the Purple Weekend festival. In 2014, The Blues Magoos released their first new album in 43 years, titled "Psychedelic Resurrection". The Blues Magoos toured in 2015. ==Discography==  *"Psychedelic Lollipop" (1966) (#15 Can.) *"Electric Comic Book" (1967) (#14 Can.) *"Basic Blues Magoos" (1968) *"Never Goin' Back to Georgia" (1969) *"Gulf Coast Bound" (1970) *"Psychedelic Resurrection" (2014)  {| class="wikitable" |- ! rowspan="1"| Year ! rowspan="1"| Titles<br /><small>Both sides from same album except where indicated</small> ! rowspan="1" style="text-align:center; width:40px;"| ! rowspan="1" style="text-align:center; width:40px;"| ! rowspan="1"| Album |- |rowspan="3"|1966 | align="left"|"The People Had No Faces"<br /><small>b/w "So I'm Wrong and You Are Night"<br />Original release on Verve Folkways shown as "The Bloos Magoos"</small> | style="text-align:center;"| – | style="text-align:center;"| – | align="left"|Non-album tracks |- | align="left"|"Tobacco Road (song)|Tobacco Road"<br /><small>b/w "Sometimes I Think About"</small> |  |  | align="left" rowspan="2"|"Psychedelic Lollipop" |- | align="left"|"(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet"<br /><small>b/w "Gotta Get Away"</small> |  |  |- | rowspan="8"|1967 | align="left"|"Pipe Dream" / |  |  | align="left" rowspan="2"|"Electric Comic Book" |- | align="left"|"There's A Chance We Can Make It" |  |  |- | align="left"|"So I'm Wrong and You Are Right"<br /><small>b/w "The People Had No Faces"<br />Second release on Verve as "The Bloos Magoos" </small> |  |  | align="left" rowspan="2"|Non-album tracks   |- | align="left"|"So I'm Wrong and You Are Right"<br /><small>b/w "The People Had No Faces"<br />Third release on Verve Folkways as "The Blues Magoos" </small> |  |  |- | align="left"|"One by One" (re-recording of song from "Psychedelic Lollipop")<br /><small>b/w "Dante's Inferno" (Non-album track)</small> |  |  | align="left"|Non-album tracks |- | align="left"|"I Wanna Be There"<br /><small> b/w "Summer Is The Man" (from "Electric Comic Book")</small> |  |  | align="left" rowspan="2"|"Basic Blues Magoos" |- | align="left"|"There She Goes"<br /><small>b/w "Life Is Just A Cher O' Bowlies" (from "Electric Comic Book")</small> |  |  |- | align="left"|"Jingle Bells"<br /><small>b/w "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" </small> |  |  | align="left"|Non-album tracks   |- | 1968 | align="left"|"I Can Hear The Grass Grow"<br /><small>b/w "Yellow Roses" </small> |  |  | align="left"|"Basic Blues Magoos"  |- | rowspan="3"|1969 | align="left"|"Let Your Love Ride"<br /><small>b/w "Who Do You Love" </small> |  |  | align="left"|Non-album tracks  |- | align="left"|"Heartbreak Hotel"<br /><small>b/w "I Can Feel It (Feelin' Time)" </small> |  |  | align="left" rowspan="2"|"Never Goin' Back To Georgia" |- | align="left"|"Never Goin' Back To Georgia"<br /><small>b/w "Feelin' Time (I Can Feel It)" </small> |  |  |- | 1970 | align="left"|"Gulf Coast Bound"<br /><small>b/w "Sea Breeze Express" </small> |  |  | align="left"|"Gulf Coast Bound"  |- |} ==Re-releases on CD== The original group's output on Compact disc|CD is now complete.
