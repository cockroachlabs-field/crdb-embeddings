She is credited with creator deity|creating humanity and repairing the Pillar of Tian|Heaven. As creator of mankind, she molded humans individually by hand with yellow clay. In the Huainanzi, there is described a great battle between deities that broke the pillars supporting Tian|Heaven and caused great devastation. There was great flooding, and Tian|Heaven had collapsed. Nüwa was the one who patched the holes in Tian|Heaven with five colored stones, and she used the legs of a tortoise to mend the pillars. There are many instances of her in literature across China which detail her in creation stories, and today remains a figure important to Chinese culture. ==Name== The character "nü" () is a common prefix on the names of goddesses. The proper name is "wa", also read as "gua" (). The Chinese character is unique to this name. Birrell translates it as 'lovely', but notes that it "could be construed as 'frog', which is consistent with her aquatic myth.Anne Birrell (1999), trans., "The Classic of Mountains and Seas." Penguin Books. In Chinese, the word for 'whirlpool' is "wo" (), which shares the same pronunciation with the word for 'snail' (). These characters all have their right side constructed by the word "wa" (), which can be translated as 'spiral' or 'helix' as noun, and as 'spin' or 'rotate' when as verb, to describe the 'helical movement'. This mythical meaning has also been symbolically pictured as compasses in the hand which can be found on many paintings and portraits associated with her. Her reverential name is "Wahuang" (). ==Description== File:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Spirits and the Supernatural - pic54 - 女媧神圖.svg|thumb|Image of Nüwa from Gujin Tushu Jicheng by Chen Menglei, Qing dynasty The "Huainanzi" relates Nüwa to the time when Heaven and Earth were in disruption: }} }} The catastrophes were supposedly caused by the battle between the deities Gonggong and Zhuanxu (an event that was mentioned earlier in the "Huainanzi"),}} the five-colored stones symbolize the Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|five Chinese elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), the black dragon was the essence of water and thus cause of the floods, Ji Province serves metonymically for the Zhongyuan|central regions (the Sinitic world). Following this, the "Huainanzi" tells about how the sage-rulers Nüwa and Fuxi set order over the realm by following Tao|the Way () and De (Chinese)|its potency (). The "Classic of Mountains and Seas", dated between the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty, describes Nüwa's intestines as being scattered into ten spirits. In "Liezi" (c. 475 – 221 BC), Chapter 5 "Questions of Tang" (), author Lie Yukou describes Nüwa repairing the original imperfect heaven using five-colored stones, and cutting the legs off a ao (turtle)|tortoise to use as struts to hold up the sky. In "Chuci|Songs of Chu" (c. 340 – 278 BC), Chapter 3 "Heavenly Questions|Asking Heaven" (), author Qu Yuan writes that Nüwa molded figures from the yellow earth, giving them life and the ability to bear children. After demons fought and broke the pillars of the heavens, Nüwa worked unceasingly to repair the damage, melting down the five-coloured stones to mend the heavens. In "Shuowen Jiezi" (c. 58 – 147 AD), China's earliest dictionary, under the entry for Nüwa author Xu Shen describes her as being both the sister and the wife of Fuxi. Nüwa and Fuxi were pictured as having snake-like tails interlocked in an Han Dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han Dynasty mural in the Wuliang Temple in Jiaxiang county, Shandong province. In "Duyizhi|Duyi Zhi" (; c. 846 – 874 AD), Volume 3, author Li Rong gives this description.  In "Yuchuan Ziji" ( c. 618 – 907 AD), Chapter 3 (), author Lu Tong describes Nüwa as the wife of Fuxi. In "Siku Quanshu", Sima Zhen (679–732) provides commentary on the prologue chapter to Sima Qian's "Shiji", "Supplemental to the Historic Record: History of the Three August Ones", wherein it is found that the Three August Ones and Five Emperors|Three August Ones are Nüwa, Fuxi, and Shennong; Fuxi and Nüwa have the same last name,  Feng (; Hmong: Faj).}} In the collection "Songsi Dashu|Four Great Books of Song" (c. 960 – 1279 AD), compiled by Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang and others, Volume 78 of the book "Taiping Yulan|Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era" contains a chapter "Customs by Yingshao of the Han Dynasty" in which it is stated that there were no men when the sky and the earth were separated. Thus Nüwa used yellow clay to make people. But the clay was not strong enough so she put ropes into the clay to make the bodies erect. It is also said that she prayed to gods to let her be the goddess of marital affairs. Variations of this story exist. == Iconography of Fuxi and Nüwa == File:NuwaFuxi1.JPG|thumb|Nüwa and Fuxi on the murals (rubbing depicted) of the Wu Liang shrines, Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD)|left|upright=1.1The iconography of Fuxi and Nüwa vary in physical appearance depending on the time period and also shows regional differences. In Chinese tomb murals and iconography, Fuxi and Nüwa generally have snake-like bodies and human face or head. Fuxi and Nüwa can be depicted as individual figures arranged as a symmetrical pair or they can be depicted in double figures with intertwined snake-like bodies. Their snake-like tails can also be depicted stretching out towards each other. Fuxi and Nüwa can also appear individually on separate tomb bricks. They generally hold or embrace the sun or moon discs containing the images of a Three-legged crow|bird (or a three-legged crow) or a toad (sometimes a hare) which are the sun and moon symbolism respectively, and/or each holding a try square or a pair of Compass (drawing tool)|compasses, or holding a longevity mushroom () plant. Fuxi and Nüwa holding the sun and the moon appears as early as the late Western Han dynasty. Other physical appearance variation, such as lower snake-like body shape (e.g. thick vs thin tails), depictions of legs (i.e. legs found along the snake-like body) and wings (e.g. wings with feathers which protrude from their backs as found in late Western Han Xinan (新安) Tomb or smaller quills found on their shoulders), and in hats and hairstyles, also exist. In the Luoyang regions murals dating to the late Han dynasty|Western Han dynasty, Fuxi and Nüwa are generally depicted as individual figures, each one found at each side of the central ridge of tomb chambers as found in the Bu Qianqiu Tomb. They can also be found without intertwining tails from the stone murals of the same period. Since the middle of the Han dynasty|Eastern Han dynasty, their tails started to intertwine. In the Gansu murals dating to the Cao Wei|Wei and Jin dynasty (266–420)|Western Jin period, one of the most typical features of Fuxi is the "mountain-hat" () which looks like a three-peaked cap while Nüwa is depicted wearing various hairstyles characteristic of Han women. Both deities dressed in wide-sleeved clothing, which reflects typical Hanfu|Han clothing style also commonly depicted in Han dynasty art.<gallery mode="nolines"> File:NuwaFuxi2.JPG|Fuxi and Nüwa.
