She was created "suo jure" Duchy of La Vallière|Duchess of La Vallière and Duchess of Vaujours. After leaving the royal court, Louise dedicated her life to religion, becoming a nun in 1674. == Ancestry and early life (1644–1661) == Françoise "Louise" de La Baume Le Blanc de La Vallière, Mademoiselle de La Vallière was born on 6 August 1644 at the Hôtel de la Crouzille (also known as Hôtel de la Vallière) in Tours, Kingdom of France as the daughter of Officer (armed forces)|military officer Laurent de La Baume Le Blanc, Lord of La Vallière and his wife, born Françoise Le Prévost, widow of a councillor of the "parlement". The La Blaume Le Blanc family had distungished itself in military service to the crown, while the Le Prévosts had served the throne with their legal knowledge for generations. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://iep.utm.edu/lavallie/ |access-date=2022-05-25 |language=en-US}} At the time of her birth, her father was the governor of the Château d'Amboise|Castle of Amboise, where she spent her first years, also spending time in her family's Château de La Vallière|Castle of La Vallière in Reugny, Indre-et-Loire|Reugny.Gustave Braux: "Louise de La Vallière – de sa Touraine natale au Carmel de Paris", C.L.D., 1981, p. 17. During these years, she was educated by her aunts, Ursulines|Ursuline nuns Élisabeth and Charlotte in reading, grammar, musical composition and public speaking. Following her father's death, La Vallière's mother married Jacques de Courtavel, Marquess of Saint-Rémy, butler of the exiled Gaston, Duke of Orléans (uncle of Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV, known as ""Monsieur"," 1608–1660). La Vallière served as a lady's companion to the duke's three younger daughters, Fils de France|Princesses Marguerite Louise d'Orléans|Marguerite-Louise (1645–1721), Élisabeth Marguerite d'Orléans|Élisabeth-Marguerite "Isabelle" (1646–1696), and Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans|Françoise-Madeleine (1648–1664), being educated with them in painting, music, etiquette, equitation, literature and philosophy by the duke's first almoner, Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé, who went on to found the Trappists|Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance ("Trappists"). After the death of the Duke of Orléans, his widow Marguerite of Lorraine|Marguerite (1615–1672) moved with her daughters to the Luxembourg Palace, Paris and took then-sixteen-year-old La Vallière with them. == Life at the royal court (1661–1671) == Through the influence of a distant relative, Madame de Choisy (born Jeanne-Olympe Hurault de L'Hospital; 1604–1669) Mademoiselle de La Vallière was named maid of honour to Henrietta of England|Henrietta (1644–1670), the new Duchess of Orléans, wife of Louis XIV's brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (1640–1701) and moved to her home, the Tuileries Palace. Henrietta, known as ""Madame"" joined the court at Fontainebleau in 1661,  where La Vallière likely first met her future lover, Louis XIV, King of France (1638–1715). She served the duchess together with Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, Marquise de Montespan|Françoise de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente (1640–1707), the future Madame de Montespan.

A close relationship soon formed between the king and Madame, which concerned the Queen dowager|Queen Dowager, Anne of Austria|Anne (1601–1666). In order to counter rumours, they allegedly decided that he should court other women as a front, for which Madame herself selected three young ladies, including La Vallière. She spent only two months in Fontainebleau before becoming the king's mistress. According to one version of the events, she knew nothing of her part in a ploy to avert a scandal, delightfully believing that the monarch's feelings for her were sincere. Apart from her skills in various arts and sports, it was La Vallière's innocence and sincerity that captured the king: one source states that he fell in love with her after, upon their first meeting, she exclaimed ""Ah! if he was not the King...".Calon, Oliver (2017). "Ah! s'il n'était pas le roi – Louise de la Vallière". "Les petites phrases qui ont fait la grande histoire". Vuibert. pp. 84–85. Fraser, Antonia, "Love and Louis XIV", Anchor Books, 2006, pp. 70–71." This was Mademoiselle de La Vallière's first relationship. She was reportedly an innocent, religious girl who did not behave flirtatiously or acted on self-interest during the romance. She was not extravagant, nor was she interested in the wealth or the titles she could receive. from her situation. Antonia Fraser writes that she was a "secret lover not a "maîtresse-en-titre" like Barbara Villiers."ib. Fraser, pp. 83–84. Nicolas Fouquet's curiosity in the affair was one of the causes of his disgrace, for, when he bribed Louise, the king mistakenly thought that Fouquet was attempting to take her as a lover.ib. Fraser, pp. 70–75.<sup></sup> The affair, although discreet, quickly became public, angering the clergy, including celebrated orator and future Roman Catholic Diocese of Meaux|Bishop of Meaux, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet (1627–1704), as well as many religiously devoted people in the court. It also invoked the bitter sarcasm of Madame. Wishing to avoid scandal and a confrontation with his mother, the king moved La Vallière to a hunting lodge in the forest near Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles, not far from Saint-Germain-en-Laye. In February 1662, the couple had a conflict: upon direct questioning by the king, La Vallière refused to tell him about the alleged affair between the Duchess of Orléans and Armand de Gramont, Comte de Guiche|Armand de Gramont, Count of Guiche (1637–1673).  Around the same time, Bossuet delivered a series of Lenten sermons condemning the immoral activities of the king through the example of David's adultery, which troubled the pious girl's conscience, and she fled to a convent in Chaillot.ib. Fraser, pp. 80–81. Meanwhile, her enemies, lead by the Olympia Mancini, Countess of Soissons|Countess of Soissons, born Olympia Mancini, Countess of Soissons|Olympia Mancini conspired to bring La Vallière down by bringing the affair to the attention of Queen Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa (1638–1683). During her first pregnancy in 1663, La Vallière was removed from the service of the Duchess of Orléans and sent to live in the Palais-Royal, where, on 19 December 1663, she gave birth to a son, Charles (1663–1665). He was taken immediately and secretly to Saint-Leu and entrusted to the care of two faithful servants of Chief minister of France|Chief Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683). Despite the attempts of Dr Boucher, who was present at the birth and tried to make the transfer as secret as possible, the story quickly spread through Paris. The public scorn at the Midnight Mass on 24 December was so great that La Vallière escaped from the church.Breton, Guy; "Histoires d'amour de l'histoire de France IV: Les favorites de Louis XIV", Presses de la Cité, Paris, 1991, p. 115. File:La Fête-Les Plaisirs de l'Ile Enchantée-donnée par Louis XIV à Versailles-Théâtre.jpg|thumb|The theatre installed for the premiere of The Princess of Elid on a contemporary engraving by Israel Silvestre (1621–1691). In 1664, Louis XIV hosted a multi-day performance and party, called "The Pleasures of the Enchanted Island|Les Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée" ("The Pleasures of the Enchanted Island") in the hunting lodge where his mistress lived. During the festivities, Molière (1622–1673) presented two new plays, "La Princesse d'Élide" (The Princess of Elid) and "Tartuffe|Le Tartuffe, ou l'Imposteur" ("Tartuffe", or The Impostor/Hypocrite) with the musical arrangements of Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–1687). Queen Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa and the dowager queen were the official dedicators, while La Vallière was the unofficial dedicatee, leading to court gossip.<sup></sup>  This only worsened when she received the domain of Carrières-sur-Seine, and started building a castle there, with gardens designed by André Le Nôtre (1613–1700), the royal landscape architect. In 1665, the king had two affairs beside the one with La Vallière: he was temporarily involved with Bonne de Pons d'Heudicourt (1644–1709), whose family quickly had her removed from the court, then with the Princess of Monaco, born Catherine Charlotte de Gramont (1639–1678). After the death of his mother in 1666, Louis XIV started to publicly display his affair, which greatly displeased La Vallière. Within a week of the dowager queen's death, La Vallière had to appear at Mass (liturgy)|mass next to the queen. Ashamed, she treated Maria Theresa with humility and respect. = File:Follower Pierre Mignard - Portrait of a Lady, said to be Madame de Montespan.jpg|left|thumb|Madame de Montespan in 1670 Around the time of the death of the queen dowager, the former Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, now the Marquise of Montespan returned to the service of the Duchess of Orléans, which she left because of her marriage in 1663. Now a lady-in-waiting, she quickly established herself as the reigning beauty of the court. Enamoured, the king sought to take her as his new mistress.Letter to Madame de Grignan from 29 July 1676, No. 563 in the edition of Mr. Monmerqué, p. 564  . In May 1667, before going on a military campaign to Flanders, the king legitimised their only living child, Marie-Anne (1666–1739). Their three eldest children, Charles (1663–1665), Philippe (1665–1666), and Louis (1665–1666) had already died by this time. Marie-Anne thus became a "Fils de France|fille legitimée de France" ("legitimised daughter of France"), could use the surname "de House of Bourbon|Bourbon" and received the title "Mademoiselle de Blois".
