The district has almost 30,000 inhabitants. The "J" stands for Jutland, as there is another town called Viby on the island of Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand, officially referred to as Viby, Roskilde Municipality|Viby Sj and also a village on Funen. == Etymology and origin == Viby derives from the Old Norse words "vé" and "býr", meaning holy place and town respectively. "Vé (shrine)|Vi" is a word represented in many place names in both Denmark and Sweden. Several places are named Viby in both Denmark and Sweden (see Viby (disambiguation) for examples) and "vi" is also present in names like Viborg, Denmark|Viborg or the Swedish towns of Odensvi, Torsvi, Frösvi, Ullavi or Visby. "Vi" refers to "an enclosed holy place", and it is believed that Viby was once a holy place where the Norse gods were worshipped, with one or several cult houses. The shrines were probably located at what was formerly known as Tyrseng - the area around the large association football fields in the southwest of Viby. The name "Tyrseng" translates as "Tyrs-meadow", referring to the Norse God Tyr. These theories are backed up by other more or less sound evidence. In 1915, remains of an old hall dating from the Viking Age, was unearthed at the hill of Kongsbakke (lit.: "kings-hill"), when the public school of Viby Skole was constructed. Medieval sources explains, that the hill of Kongsbakke was once the site of a royal estate in ancient times. Our general research-based knowledge of the Norse culture in the Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age and Viking Age tells us, that kings and magnates settled near vis and Heathen hofs|hofs, as they also worked as priests of the Norse religion and were needed there to attend the Norse rituals|rituals.

The expansions were intended to increase the population from 16,000 to 50,000. In early July 1961, Århus Stiftstidende could announce that: *100 acres (40 ha) of land were to be designated for industry; *1800 new flats were to be built; *The centre would be freshened up to include a 10 storeys tall hotel, and a shopping centre; *Two new schools and a church would be constructed; *Road expansions would be made. In 1970, a municipality reform made Viby a part of Aarhus and the Viby Centret shopping centre was finished.
