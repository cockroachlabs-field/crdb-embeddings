The position of Prime Minister was established in 1910, when the Union of South Africa was formed. He was appointed by the head of state—the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|governor-general until 1961 and the State President of South Africa|state president after South Africa became a republic in 1961. In practice, he was the leader of the majority party or coalition in the House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly. With few exceptions, the governor-general/state president was bound by convention to act on the prime minister's advice. Thus, the prime minister was the country's leading political figure and "de facto" chief executive, with powers similar to those of his Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British counterpart. The first prime minister was Louis Botha, a former Boer general and war hero during the Second Boer War. The position of Prime Minister was abolished in 1984, when the State President was given executive powers after a South African Constitution of 1983|new constitution was adopted – effectively merging the role of Prime Minister and State President. The last Prime Minister of South Africa, P. W. Botha, became the first executive State President after the constitutional reform in 1984 after Marais Viljoen's retirement. In post-apartheid South Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party has called for a return to a Westminster-style split executive with a Prime Minister as head of government, which is part of its overarching goal of avoiding a single party South African state., 12 October 2012 ==List of prime ministers of South Africa== ;Parties |South African Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br /> |United Party (South Africa)|United Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br /> |National Party (South Africa)|National Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} {| class="wikitable" style="width:100%; text-align:center;" |- ! rowspan="2"|  ! rowspan="2" width=100px| Portrait ! rowspan="2" width=25%| Name<br /><br /> ! colspan="3"| Term of office ! rowspan="2"| Elected<br /> ! rowspan="2"| Political party ! rowspan="2"| Government |- !
