The decision to launch the operation rested with the Prime Minister of India, then Indira Gandhi, who had already authorized military preparation for a confrontation at the temple complex 18 months prior according to the then-Vice Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of the Army Staff, Srinivas Kumar Sinha|S. K. Sinha. In July 1982, Harchand Singh Longowal, the president of the Sikh political party Shiromani Akali Dal, had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in the Golden Temple to evade arrest by government authorities. List of Indian intelligence agencies|Indian intelligence agencies had reported that three prominent Sikh figures—Shabeg Singh, Balbir Singh and Amrik Singh, referred to in reports as "prominent heads of the Khalistan movement"—had each made at least six trips to neighbouring Pakistan between 1981 and 1983. Shabeg Singh, an Indian Army officer who later deserted to join Bhindranwale, was identified as the provider of weapons training at Akal Takht. The Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau alleged that training was being provided at various gurdwaras throughout Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Amrik Singh responded to these allegations by stating that student training camps with "traditional weapons" had existed for four decades at these locations. The KGB intelligence agency of the Soviet Union had tipped off India's Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) about a joint operation between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to stir separatist unrest in the Indian state of Punjab. False claims were also made that R&AW had received intelligence by interrogating a Pakistani soldier that over a thousand Special Service Group commandos of the Pakistan Army had been dispatched by the Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government into Indian Punjab to assist Bhindranwale in his fight against the Government of India|Indian government; however, no signs of commandos were found and no proofs were provided by R&AW. In 1981, the Soviets launched "Operation Kontakt", which was based on a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by the ISI to Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country. In November 1982, Yuri Andropov, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet Union, approved a proposal to fabricate Pakistani intelligence documents detailing ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan movement|Khalistan as an independent Sikh state. Indira Gandhi's decision to move troops into the Punjab was based on her taking seriously the information provided by the Soviets regarding secret CIA support for the Sikhs. Leading up to Operation Bluestar, there were several protests by Sangh Parivar, including a march led by L. K. Advani|LK Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee|AB Vajpayee of the Bharatiya Janata Party|Bhartiya Janta Party to protest against the lack of government action and to demand that the Indian Army be sent into the Golden Temple.{{Cite web |title=LK Advani supported Operation Bluestar, claims  ...
