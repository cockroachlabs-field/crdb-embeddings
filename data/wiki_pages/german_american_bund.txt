The organization chose its new name in order to emphasize its American credentials after the press accused it of being unpatriotic. The Bund was allowed to consist only of German Americans|American citizens of German descent. Its main goal was to promote a favorable view of Nazi Germany. ==History==   In May 1933, Nazi Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess gave German immigrant and German Nazi Party member Heinz Spanknobel|Heinz Spanknöbel authority to form an American Nazi organization. Shortly thereafter, with help from the German consul in New York City, Spanknöbel created the Friends of New Germany by merging two older organizations in the United States, Gau-USANazi Party/Foreign Organization:de:NSDAP/AO and the Free Society of Teutonia, which were both small groups with only a few hundred members each. The FoNG was based in New York City but had a strong presence in Chicago. Male members wore a uniform, a white shirt, black trousers and a black hat adorned with a red symbol. Female members wore a white blouse and a black skirt. IMDb<!-- need better source than imdb --> The organization which was led by Spanknöbel was openly pro-Nazi, and it engaged in activities such as storming the German language "New Yorker Staats-Zeitung" and demanding that it publish pro-Nazi articles, and infiltrating other non-political German-American organizations. One of the Friends' early initiatives was to use propaganda to counter the Jewish boycott of German goods, which was started in March 1933 as a protest against Nazi anti-Semitism. In an internal battle for control of the Friends, Spanknöbel was ousted as its leader and subsequently, he was deportation|deported in October 1933 because he had failed to register as a foreign agent. At the same time, Congressman Samuel Dickstein (congressman)|Samuel Dickstein, Chairman of the Committee on Naturalization and Immigration, became aware of the substantial number of foreigners who were legally and illegally entering the country and residing in it, and the growing Antisemitism|anti-Semitism along with vast amounts of anti-Semitic literature which were being distributed in the country. This led him to independently investigate the activities of Nazism|Nazi and Fascism|fascist groups, leading to the formation of the House Un-American Activities Committee|Special Committee on Un-American Activities which was Authorized to Investigate Nazi Propaganda activities and Certain Other Propaganda Activities. Throughout the rest of 1934, the Committee conducted hearings, bringing most of the major figures in the American fascist movement before it. Dickstein's investigation concluded that the Friends represented a branch of German dictator Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party in the United States. The organization existed into the mid-1930s, although it always remained small, with a membership of between 5,000 and 10,000, mostly consisting of German citizens who were living in the United States and German emigrants who had only recently become citizens. In December 1935, Rudolf Hess ordered all German citizens to leave the FoNG and all of its leaders were recalled to Germany.

The Bund elected a German-born American citizen Fritz Julius Kuhn as its leader ("Führer|Bundesführer"). Kuhn was a veteran of the Bavarian Army|Bavarian infantry during World War I and an "Alter Kämpfer" ("old fighter") of the Nazi Party who, in 1934, was granted Citizenship of the United States|American citizenship. Kuhn was initially effective as a leader and was able to unite the organization and expand its membership but came to be seen simply as an incompetent swindler and liar. The administrative structure of the Bund mimicked the regional administrative subdivision of the Nazi Party. The German American Bund divided the United States into three "Gau (German)#Nazi period|Gaue": Gau Ost (East), Gau West and Gau Midwest.  Together the three "Gaue" comprised 69 "Ortsgruppen" (local groups): 40 in Gau Ost (17 in New York), 10 in Gau West and 19 in Gau Midwest. Each Gau had its own "Gauleiter" and staff to direct the Bund operations in the region in accordance with the "Führerprinzip". The Bund's national headquarters was located at 178 85th Street (Manhattan)|East 85th Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan.
