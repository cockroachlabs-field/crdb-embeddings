Located in the diocese of Rochester, it is the administrative centre of the Gravesham|Borough of Gravesham. Its geographical situation has given Gravesend strategic importance throughout the maritime history|maritime and History of communication|communications history of South East England. A Thames Gateway commuter town, it retains strong links with the River Thames, not least through the Port of London Authority Pilot Station and has witnessed rejuvenation since the advent of High Speed 1 rail services via Gravesend railway station. The station was recently refurbished and now has a new bridge. ==Toponymy== File:Gravesend Town Hall-geograph.org-3552497.jpg|thumb|upright|Gravesend Town Hall Recorded as Gravesham in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it belonged to Odo, Earl of Kent and Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayeux|Bishop of Bayeux, the half-brother of William the Conqueror, its name probably derives from "graaf-ham": the home of the sheriff|reeve or bailiff of the lord of the manor. Another theory suggests that the name "Gravesham" may be a corruption of the words "grafs-ham" – a place "at the end of the grove".Paul Theroux's report that "the town bore the name of Gravesend because east of it, the dead had to be buried at sea", is unsupported (Theroux, "The Kingdom by the Sea" 1983:19). Frank Carr asserts that the name derives from the Saxon "Gerevesend", the end of the authority of the Portreeve (originally "Portgereve", chief town administrator). In the Netherlands, a place called 's-Gravenzande is found with its name translating into "Sand (or sandy area) belonging to the Count". The "s" is a contraction of the old Dutch genitive article "des", and translates into plain English as "of the". In Brooklyn, New York, the neighbourhood of Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend is said by some to have been named for 's-Gravenzande., though its founding by the English religious dissenter, Deborah Moody|Lady Deborah Moody, in 1645 strongly indicates that it is named after Gravesend, England. Lady Deborah was originally from London and is credited with being the first woman to found a settlement in the New World. The Domesday spelling is its earliest known historical record; all other spellings – in the later (c. 1100) Domesday "Monachorum" and in "Textus Roffensis" the town is "Gravesend" and "Gravesende", respectively. The variation "Graveshend" can be seen in a court record of 1422, where Langford, Bedfordshire|Edmund de Langeford was parson, and attributed to where the graves ended after the Black Death. The municipal title Gravesham was formally adopted in 1974 as the name for the new municipality|borough. ==History== Stone Age implements have been found in the locality since the 1900s, as has evidence of an Iron Age settlement at nearby Springhead. Extensive Roman Britain|Roman remains have been found at nearby Springhead, Kent|Vagniacae; and Gravesend lies immediately to the north of the Roman road connecting London with the Kent coast – now called Watling Street. Domesday Book recorded Watermill|mills, wikt:hythe|hythes, and fishery|fisheries here."The Book of Gravesham", Sydney Harker 1979 ISBN o-86023-091-0 File:Milton Chantry.jpg|thumb|"Milton Chantry", built  1320 Milton Chantry is Gravesend's oldest surviving building and dates from the early 14th century. It was refounded as a chapel in 1320/21 on the original site of a former leper hospital founded in 1189. It is a Grade II* listed building. Gravesend has one of the oldest surviving Marketplace|markets in the England|country. Its earliest charter dates from 1268, with town status being granted to the two parishes of St George's Church, Gravesend|Gravesend and Milton-next-Gravesend|Milton by Henry III of England|King Henry III in its Charter of Incorporation of that year. The first Mayor of Gravesend was elected in 1268 but the first town hall was not built until 1573. The current Gravesend Town Hall was completed in 1764: although it ceased to operate as a seat of government in 1968 when the new Gravesend Civic Centre  was opened, it remained in use as a magistrates' court until 2000. It now operates as a venue for weddings and civil partnership ceremonies. In 1380, during the Hundred Years' War, Gravesend suffered being sacked and burned by the Kingdom of Castile|Castilian Naval fleet|fleet. In 1401, a further Royal Charter was granted, allowing the men of the town to operate boats between City of London|London and the town; these became known as the "Long Ferry". It became the preferred form of passage, because of the perils of road travel (see below). On Gravesend's river front are the remains of a device fort built by command of Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII in 1543. File:St Georges Church.jpg|thumb|upright|Pocahontas statue outside <br />St George's Church, Gravesend|St George, Gravesend In March 1617, John Rolfe and his Native American wife Rebecca (Pocahontas), with their two-year-old son, Thomas Rolfe|Thomas, boarded a ship in London bound for Virginia|the Commonwealth of Virginia; the ship had only sailed as far as Gravesend before Rebecca fell ill,Price, "Love and Hate". p. 182. and she died shortly after she was taken ashore. It is not known what caused her death.Dr. Linwood "Little Bear" Custalow and Angela L. Danieal "Silver Star", "The True Story of Pocahontas: The Other Side of History" Her funeral and interment took place on 21 March 1617 at the parish church of St George's Church, Gravesend|St George, Gravesend. The site of her grave was underneath the church's chancel, though since the previous church was destroyed by fire in 1727 her exact resting place is unknown. Thomas Rolfe survived, but was placed under the supervision of Lewis Stukley|Sir Lewis Stukley at Plymouth, before being sent to his uncle, Henry Rolfe whilst John Rolfe and his late wife's assistant Tomocomo reached America under the captaincy of Samuel Argall|Sir Samuel Argall's ship. Pocahontas (real name: Matoaka) is an important figure in both American and British history and was the inspiration for the popular Pocahontas (1995 film)|Disney animated film of the same name. File:New Tavern Fort, Gravesend Kent UK.JPG|thumb|Interior of New Tavern Fort At "Fort Gardens" is the "New Tavern Fort", built during the 1780s and extensively rebuilt by Charles George Gordon|Major-General Charles Gordon between 1865 and 1879; it is now the Milton Chantry|Chantry Heritage Centre, under the care of English local history|Gravesend Local History Society. The fort is a Scheduled monument. Journeys by road to Gravesend were historically quite hazardous, since the main Transport in Kent|London-Dover road crossed Blackheath, London|Blackheath, notorious for its highwaymen. Stagecoaches from London to Canterbury, Dover and Faversham used Gravesend as one of their "stages" as did those coming north from Tonbridge. In 1840 there were 17 coaches picking up and setting down passengers and changing horses each way per day. There were two coaching inns on what is now Old Road East: "the Prince of Orange" and "the Lord Nelson". Post coaches had been plying the route for at least two centuries: Samuel Pepys records having stopped off at Gravesend in 1650 en route to the Royal Dockyards at Chatham. A permanent military presence was established in the town when Milton Barracks opened in 1862. Although much of the town's economy continued to be connected with maritime trade, since the 19th century other major employers have been the cement and paper industries.
