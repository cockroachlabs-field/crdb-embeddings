In mathematics, a "Lie groupoid" is a groupoid where the set <math>\operatorname{Ob}</math> of object (category theory)|objects and the set <math>\operatorname{Mor}</math> of morphisms are both manifolds, all the category (mathematics)|category operations (source and target, composition, identity-assigning map and inversion) are smooth, and the source and target operations :<math>s,t : \operatorname{Mor} \to \operatorname{Ob} </math> are submersion (mathematics)|submersions. A Lie groupoid can thus be thought of as a "many-object generalization" of a Lie group, just as a groupoid is a many-object generalization of a group (mathematics)|group. Accordingly, while Lie groups provide a natural model for (classical) Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries, Lie groupoids are often used as model for (and arise from) generalised, point-dependent symmetries. Extending the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence|correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, Lie groupoids are the global counterparts of Lie algebroids. Lie groupoids were introduced by Charles Ehresmann under the name "differentiable groupoids". == Definition and basic concepts == A "Lie groupoid" consists of * two smooth manifolds <math>G</math> and <math>M</math> * two Surjective function|surjective Submersion (mathematics)|submersions <math>s,t : G \to M </math> (called, respectively, "source" and "target" projections) * a map <math>m: G^{(2)}:= \{ (g,h) \mid s(g)=t(h) \} \to G </math> (called "multiplication" or composition map), where we use the notation <math>gh := m (g,h) </math> * a map <math>u: M \to G </math> (called "unit" map or object inclusion map), where we use the notation <math>1_x:= u(x) </math> * a map <math>i: G \to G </math> (called "inversion"), where we use the notation <math>g^{-1} := i(g) </math> such that * the composition satisfies <math>s(gh) = s(h) </math> and <math>t(gh) = t(g) </math> for every <math>g,h \in G</math> for which the composition is defined *the composition is Associative property|associative, i.e. <math>g(h l) = (gh) l </math> for every <math>g,h,l \in G</math> for which the composition is defined * <math>u </math> works as an Identity element|identity, i.e. <math>s(1_x) = t(1_x) = x </math> for every <math>x \in M</math> and <math>g 1_{s(g)} = g </math> and <math>1_{t(g)} g = g </math> for every <math>g \in G</math> * <math>i </math> works as an Inverse element|inverse, i.e. <math>g^{-1} g = 1_{s(g)} </math> and <math>g g^{-1} = 1_{t(g)} </math> for every <math>g \in G</math>. Using the language of category theory, a Lie groupoid can be more compactly defined as a groupoid (i.e. a small category where all the morphisms are invertible) such that the sets <math>M</math> of objects and <math>G</math> of morphisms are manifolds, the maps <math>s</math>, <math>t</math>, <math>m</math>, <math>i</math> and <math>u</math> are smooth and <math>s</math> and <math>t</math> are submersions. A Lie groupoid is therefore not simply a groupoid object in the Category of manifolds|category of smooth manifolds: one has to ask the additional property that <math>s</math> and <math>t</math> are submersions. Lie groupoids are often denoted by <math>G \rightrightarrows M </math>, where the two arrows represent the source and the target. The notation <math>G_1 \rightrightarrows G_0 </math> is also frequently used, especially when stressing the simplicial structure of the associated Nerve (category theory)|nerve. In order to include more natural examples, the manifold <math>G</math> is not required in general to be Hausdorff space|Hausdorff or Second-countable space|second countable (while <math>M</math> and all other spaces are).  The original definition by Ehresmann required <math>G</math> and <math>M</math> to possess a smooth structure such that only <math>m</math> is smooth and the maps <math>g \mapsto 1_{s(g)} </math> and <math>g \mapsto 1_{t(g)} </math> are subimmersions (i.e. have locally constant Rank (differential topology)|rank). Such definition proved to be too weak and was replaced by Pradines with the one currently used. While some authors introduced weaker definitions which did not require <math>s</math> and <math>t</math> to be submersions, these properties are fundamental to develop the entire Lie theory of groupoids and algebroids.  The fact that the source and the target map of a Lie groupoid <math>G \rightrightarrows M</math> are smooth submersions has some immediate consequences: * the <math>s</math>-fibres <math>s^{-1}(x) \subseteq G</math>, the <math>t</math>-fibres <math>t^{-1}(x) \subseteq G</math>, and the set of composable morphisms <math>G^{(2)} \subseteq G \times G</math> are submanifolds; * the inversion map <math>i</math> is a diffeomorphism; *the unit map <math>u</math> is a Embedding#Differential topology|smooth embedding; *the Groupoid#Vertex groups and orbits|isotropy groups <math>G_x</math> are Lie groups; * the orbits <math>\mathcal{O}_x \subseteq M</math> are immersed submanifolds; * the <math>s</math>-fibre <math>s^{-1}(x)</math> at a point <math>x \in M</math> is a Principal bundle|principal <math>G_x</math>-bundle over the orbit <math>\mathcal{O}_x</math> at that point.  A "Lie subgroupoid" of a Lie groupoid <math>G \rightrightarrows M</math> is a Groupoid#Subgroupoids and morphisms|subgroupoid <math>H \rightrightarrows N</math> (i.e. a subcategory of the category <math>G</math>) with the extra requirement that <math>H \subseteq G</math> is an immersed submanifold. As for a subcategory, a (Lie) subgroupoid is called "wide" if <math>N = M</math>. Any Lie groupoid <math>G \rightrightarrows M</math> has two canonical wide subgroupoids: * the unit/identity Lie subgroupoid <math>u(M) = \{ 1_x \in G \mid x \in M \}</math>; * the inner subgroupoid <math>IG := \{ g \in G \mid s(g)=t(g) \}</math>, i.e. the bundle of isotropy groups (which however may fail to be smooth in general). A "normal Lie subgroupoid" is a wide Lie subgroupoid <math>H \subseteq G</math> inside <math>IG</math> such that, for every <math>h \in H, g \in G</math> with <math>s(h)=t(h)=s(g)</math>, one has <math>ghg^{-1} \in H</math>. The isotropy groups of <math>H</math> are therefore normal subgroups of the isotropy groups of <math>G</math>. A "Lie groupoid morphism" between two Lie groupoids <math>G \rightrightarrows M</math> and <math>H \rightrightarrows N</math> is a groupoid morphism <math>F: G \to H, f: M \to N</math> (i.e. a functor between the categories <math>G</math> and <math>H</math>), where both <math>F</math> and <math>f</math> are smooth. The Kernel (algebra)|kernel <math>\ker(F):= \{ g \in G \mid F(g) = 1_{s(g)} \}</math> of a morphism between Lie groupoids over the same base manifold is automatically a normal Lie subgroupoid. The quotient <math>G/\ker(F) \rightrightarrows M</math> has a natural groupoid structure such that the projection <math>G \to G/\ker(F)</math> is a groupoid morphism; however, unlike Quotient group#Quotients of Lie groups|quotients of Lie groups, <math>G/\ker(F)</math> may fail to be a Lie groupoid in general. Accordingly, the isomorphism theorems for groupoids cannot be specialised to the entire category of Lie groupoids, but only to special classes. A Lie groupoid is called "abelian" if its isotropy Lie groups are Abelian group|abelian. For similar reasons as above, while the definition of Abelianization|abelianisation of a group extends to set-theoretical groupoids, in the Lie case the analogue of the quotient <math>G^{ab} = G/(IG, IG)</math> may not exist or be smooth.  A "bisection" of a Lie groupoid <math>G \rightrightarrows M</math> is a smooth map <math>b: M \to G</math> such that <math>s \circ b = id_M</math> and <math>t \circ b</math> is a diffeomorphism of <math>M</math>. In order to overcome the lack of symmetry between the source and the target, a bisection can be equivalently defined as a submanifold <math>B \subseteq G</math> such that <math>s_{\mid B}: B \to M</math> and <math>t_{\mid B}: B \to M</math> are diffeomorphisms; the relation between the two definitions is given by <math>B = b(M)</math>.}} The set of bisections forms a Group (mathematics)|group, with the multiplication <math>b_1 \cdot b_2</math> defined as<math display="block">(b_1 \cdot b_2) (x) := b_1 (b_2 (x)) b_2(x).</math>and inversion defined as<math display="block">b_1^{-1} (x) := i \circ b_1 \left( (t\circ b_2)^{-1} (x) \right)</math>Note that the definition is given in such a way that, if <math>t \circ b_1 = \phi_1</math> and <math>t \circ b_2 = \phi_2</math>, then <math>t \circ (b_1 \cdot b_2) = \phi_1 \circ \phi_2</math> and <math>t \circ b_1^{-1} = \phi_1^{-1}</math>. The group of bisections can be given the compact-open topology, as well as an (infinite-dimensional) structure of Fréchet manifold compatible with the group structure, making it into a Fréchet-Lie group. A "local bisection" <math>b: U \subseteq M \to G</math> is defined analogously, but the multiplication between local bisections is of course only partially defined. ==Examples==  *Lie groupoids <math>G \rightrightarrows {*}</math> with one object are the same thing as Lie groups. *Given any manifold <math>M</math>, there is a Lie groupoid <math>M \times M \rightrightarrows M</math> called the "pair groupoid", with precisely one morphism from any object to any other. *The two previous examples are particular cases of the "trivial groupoid" <math>M \times G \times M \rightrightarrows M</math>, with structure maps <math>s(x,g,y)= y</math>, <math>t(x,g,y)=x</math>, <math>m ((x,g,y),(y,h,z))=(x,gh,z)</math>, <math>u(x) = (x,1,x)</math> and <math>i(x,g,y)= (y,g^{-1},x)</math>.  *Given any manifold <math>M</math>, there is a Lie groupoid <math>u(M) \rightrightarrows M</math> called the "unit groupoid", with precisely one morphism from one object to itself, namely the identity, and no morphisms between different objects. *More generally, Lie groupoids with <math>s=t</math> are the same thing as bundle of Lie groups (not necessarily locally trivial). For instance, any vector bundle is a bundle of abelian groups, so it is in particular a(n abelian) Lie groupoid.  *Given any Lie groupoid <math>G \rightrightarrows M</math> and a surjective submersion <math>\mu: N \to M</math>, there is a Lie groupoid <math>\mu^*G \rightrightarrows N</math>, called its "pullback groupoid" or "induced groupoid", where <math>\mu^*G \subseteq N \times G \times N</math> contains triples <math>(x,g,y)</math> such that <math>s(g)=\mu(y)</math> and <math>t(g) = \mu(x)</math>, and the multiplication is defined using the multiplication of <math>G</math>. For instance, the pullback of the pair groupoid of <math>M</math> is the pair groupoid of <math>N</math>. *Given any two Lie groupoids <math>G_1 \rightrightarrows M_1</math> and <math>G_2 \rightrightarrows M_2</math>, there is a Lie groupoid <math>G_1 \times G_2 \rightrightarrows M_1 \times M_2</math>, called their "direct product", such that the groupoid morphisms <math>G_1 \times G_2 \to \mathrm{pr}_{M_1}^*G_1</math& ...
