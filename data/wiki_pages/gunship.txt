  File:AC-130H Spectre banking turn.jpg|thumb|300px|An AC-130H gunship from the 16th Special Operations Squadron A "gunship" is a military aircraft armed with aircraft artillery|heavy aircraft guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets either as airstrike or as close air support. In modern usage the term "gunship" refers to fixed-wing aircraft having :wikt:lateral|laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. These gunships are configured to circle the target instead of performing strafing runs. Such aircraft have their armament on one side harmonized to fire at the apex of an imaginary cone formed by the aircraft and the ground when performing a pylon turn (Banked turn#Aviation|banking turn). The term "gunship" originated in the mid-19th century as a synonym for gunboat and also referred to the heavily armed ironclad steamships used during the American Civil War. The term "helicopter gunship" is commonly used to describe armed helicopters. ==World War II aviation==  File:B25 Mitchell - Chino Airshow 2014 (14033501440).jpg|thumb|The North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bomber was heavily armed with 75mm gun M2–M6|75mm and M2 Browning|.50 caliber machine guns. During 1942 and 1943, the lack of a usable escort fighter for the United States Army Air Forces in the European Theatre of Operations led to experiments in dramatically increasing the armament of a standard Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress, and later a single Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated B-24D Liberator, to each have 14 to 16 Browning M2|Browning AN/M2 .50 cal machine guns as the Boeing YB-40 Flying Fortress and Consolidated XB-41 Liberator respectively. These were to accompany regular heavy bomber formations over occupied Europe on strategic bombing raids for long-range escort duties as "flying destroyer gunships".Buttler, Griffith. "American Secret Projects: Fighters, Bombers Attack Aircraft 1937 to 1945". pp. 104-105. The YB-40 was sometimes described as a gunship, and a small 25-aircraft batch of the B-17-derived gunships were built, with a dozen of these deployed to Europe; the XB-41 had problems with stability and did not progress.  During World War II, the urgent need for hard-hitting attack aircraft led to the development of the heavily armed gunship versions of the North American B-25 Mitchell#Use as a gunship|North American B-25 Mitchell. For use against shipping in the Pacific 405 B-25Gs were armed with a 75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|75 mm (2.95 in) M4 cannon and a thousand B-25Hs followed. The H models, delivered from August 1943, moved the dorsal turret forward to just behind the cockpit and were armed with the lighter 75mm T13E1 cannon. The B-25J variant removed the 75mm gun but carried a total of eighteen 0.50 cal (12.7&nbsp;mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns, more than any other contemporary American aircraft: eight in the nose, four in under-cockpit wikt:conformal|conformal flank-mount gun pod packages, two in the Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal turret, one each in the pair of waist positions, and a pair in the tail, giving a maximum of fourteen guns firing forward in strafing runs. Later the B-25J was armed with eight 5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket|5 in. (130 mm) high velocity aircraft rockets (HVARs). The British also made large numbers of twin-engined fighter bombers. The de Havilland Mosquito FB.VI had a fixed armament of four 20&nbsp;mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk.II cannon and four .303 (7.7&nbsp;mm) M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns, together with up to 4,000 pounds of bombs in the bomb bay and on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight RP-3|"60lb" RP-3 rockets. De Havilland also produced seventeen de Havilland Mosquito#Strike ("fighter-bomber") variants|Mosquito FB Mk XVIIIs armed with a 57&nbsp;mm Ordnance QF 6-pounder|QF 6-pdr anti-tank gun with autoloader, which were used against German ships and U-boats. The Germans also made a sizable number of heavy fighter types ("Zerstörer"—"destroyer") armed with heavy guns ("Bordkanone"). Dedicated "tankbuster" aircraft such as the Junkers Ju 87#Ju 87G|Ju 87Gs ("Kanonenvogel") were armed with two BK 37|BK 37mm autocannon in underwing gun pods. The Junkers Ju 88#Attack bomber|Ju 88P gunships were armed with 37mm, 50mm and 75mm guns, and were used as tankbusters and as bomber destroyers. The Henschel Hs 129|Hs 129 could carry a 30 mm (1.181 in) MK 101 cannon or MK 103 cannon in a conformally mounted gun pod (B-2/R-2). The Messerschmitt Me 410#Variants|Me 410 "Hornisse" were armed with the same BK 5 cannon|BK 50mm autocannon as the Ju 88P-4, but were only used as bomber destroyers. None of the German twin-engine heavy fighters types were produced or converted in large numbers. ==Post–World War II aviation==  File:An AC-47 from Topeka, Kansas, conducts a gunship legacy flight during AirVenture Oshkosh 2021(cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Douglas AC-47 Spooky|AC-47 provided Close air support|CAS with three port side mounted  M134 Minigun|7.62 mm miniguns. In the more modern, post-World War II fixed-wing aircraft category, a gunship is an aircraft having :wikt:lateral|laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. These gunships were configured to circle the target instead of performing strafing runs. Such aircraft have their armament on one side harmonized to fire at the apex of an imaginary cone formed by the aircraft and the ground when performing a pylon turn (Banked turn#Aviation|banking turn). The Douglas AC-47 Spooky was the first notable modern gunship. In 1964, during the Vietnam War, the popular Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport was successfully modified into a gunship by the United States Air Force with three side-firing Miniguns for circling attacks. At the time the aircraft was known as a "Dragonship", "Puff, the Magic Dragon" or "Spooky" (officially designated FC-47, later corrected to AC-47). Its three 7.62&nbsp;mm miniguns could selectively fire either 50 or 100 rounds per second.It can be seen in action . Cruising in an overhead left-hand orbit at 120 knots air speed at an altitude of , the gunship could put a bullet or glowing red tracer (every fifth round) into every square yard of a football field–sized target in potentially less than 10 seconds. And, as long as its 45-flare and 24,000-round basic load of ammunition held out, it could do this intermittently while loitering over the target for hours. The lesser known Fairchild AC-119G Shadow and Fairchild AC-119G Shadow|AC-119K Stingers were twin-engine piston-powered gunships developed by the United States during the Vietnam War. Armed with four 7.62&nbsp;mm GAU-2/A Miniguns (and two 20&nbsp;mm (0.787&nbsp;in) M61 Vulcan six-barrel rotary cannons in the AC-119K version), they replaced the Douglas AC-47 Spooky and operated alongside the early versions of the Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectre gunship. It was the later and larger Lockheed AC-130 "Gunship II" that became the modern, post–World War II origin of the term gunship in military aviation. These heavily armed aircraft used a variety of weapon systems, including 7.62&nbsp;mm GAU-2/A Miniguns, 20&nbsp;mm (0.787&nbsp;in) M61 Vulcan six-barrel rotary cannons, 25&nbsp;mm (0.984&nbsp;in) GAU-12/U Equalizer five-barreled rotary cannons, 30&nbsp;mm Mk44 Bushmaster II chain guns, Bofors 40 mm Automatic Gun L/60|40&nbsp;mm (1.58&nbsp;in) L/60 Bofors autocannons, and 105&nbsp;mm (4.13&nbsp;in) M102 howitzers. The Douglas AC-47 Spooky, the Fairchild AC-119, and the AC-130 Spectre/Spooky, were vulnerable, and meant to operate only after achieving air superiority. Smaller gunship designs such as the Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker and the Helio Stallion|Helio AU-24 Stallion were also designed by the United States during the Vietnam War. These aircraft were meant to be cheap and easy to fly and maintain, and were to be given to friendly governments in Southeast Asia to assist with counter-insurgency operations, eventually seeing service with the Khmer National Air Force, Royal Thai Air Force, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force as well as limited use by the United States Air Force. Renewed interest in the concept of gunships has resulted in the development of a gunship variant of the Alenia C-27J Spartan. Although the United States Air Force decided not to procure the AC-27J, other nations including Italy have chosen the aircraft for introduction. Additionally, in 2013 the US Air Force Special Operations Command reportedly tested a gunship version of the PZL M28|C-145A Skytruck armed with a M2 Browning#XM213/M213, XM218, GAU-15/A, GAU-16/A, and GAU-18/A|GAU-18 twin-mount .50-calibre machine gun system.  File:3368 Czech Republic Air Force Mil Mi-24V Hind E ILA Berlin 2016 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The Mil Mi-24 was one of the first dedicated gunship helicopters. Early helicopter gunships also operated in the side-firing configuration, with an early example being the Aérospatiale Alouette III. During the Portuguese Colonial War|Overseas wars in Africa in the 1960s, the Portuguese Air Force experimented with the installation of M2 Browning .50 caliber machine guns in a side-firing twin-mounting configuration in some of its Alouette III helicopters. Later, the .50 caliber machine guns were replaced by a MG 151 cannon|MG 151 20mm cannon in a single mounting. These helicopters were known in Portuguese service as ""helicanhões" (heli-cannons) and were used in the escort of unarmed transport helicopters in air assault operations and in the fire support to the troops in the ground. The South African Air Force|South African and Rhodesian Air Force|Rhodesian air forces later used armed Alouette III in similar configurations as the Portuguese, respectively in the South African Border War|South African Border and Rhodesian Bush War|Rhodesian Bush wars. During the Algerian War, the French operated Sikorsky H-34 "Pirate" armed with a German 20mm MG 151 cannon|MG151 cannon and two .50 machine guns. During the early days of the Vietnam War, USMC Sikorsky H-34|H-34s were among the first helicopter gunships in theater, fitted with the U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems#UH-34/CH-34 Choctaw/Seahorse|Temporary Kit-1 (TK-1), comprising two M60 machine gun|M60C machine guns and two 19-shot Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|2.75 inch rocket pods. The operations were met with mixed enthusiasm, and the armed H-34s, known as "Stingers", were quickly phased out. The TK-1 kit would form the basis of the U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems#UH-1 Iroquois|TK-2 kit used later on the UH-1E helicopters of the USMC. The U.S. Army also experimented with H-34 gunships armed with M2 .50 caliber machine-guns and 2.75-inch rockets. In September 1971, a CH-34 was armed with two M2 .50 caliber machine guns, four M1919 .30 caliber machine guns, forty 2.75-inch rockets, two 5-inch high velocity aerial rockets (HVAR), plus two additional .30 caliber machine guns in the left side aft windows and one .50 caliber machine gun in the right side cargo door. The result was the world's most heavily armed helicopter at the time. Also, during the Vietnam War, the ubiquitous Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters were modified into gunships by mounting the U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems—these were forward-firing weapons, such as machine guns, rocket (weapon)|rockets, and autocannons, that began to appear in 1962–1963. Rotary-wing aircraft (helicopters) can use a variety of combat maneuvers to approach a target. In their case, the term "gunship" is synonymous with "armed helicopter|heavily armed helicopter". Specifically, dedicated attack helicopters such as the Bell AH-1 Cobra also fit this meaning. In any case, the gunship armaments include machine guns, rockets, and missiles. The Soviet Mil Mi-24 (NATO code name: Hind) is a large, heavily armed and armored helicopter gunship and transport helicopter|troop transport."Mil Mi-24 Hind Gunship". By Alexander Miladenov. Osprey Publishing 2010. Pages 4–10. It was introduced in the 1970s and operated by the pre-1991 Soviet Air Force and its successors post-1991, and more than 30 other nations. It was heavily armed with a reinforced fuselage, designed to withstand .50 caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine gun fire. Its armored cockpits and titanium rotor head are able to withstand 20&nbsp;mm cannon hits. ==Examples== ;Fixed-wing aircraft File:Fairchild AU-23A Peacemaker in flight.jpg|thumb|The Fairchild AU-23A in flight * Basler BT-67 * Douglas AC-47 Spooky|Douglas AC-47 * Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker * Fairchild AC-119 * Lockheed AC-130 * Helio AU-24 Stallion * IPTN CN-235|Airbus AC-235 * EADS CASA C-295#Variants|Airbus AC-295 ;Helicopters File:UH-1B Iroquois Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A Bell UH-1B gunship in Vietnam * Aérospatiale Alouette III|Aérospatiale SA319  * Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma|SA 330 Puma  * Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64 Apache * Boein ...
