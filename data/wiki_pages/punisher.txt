The character was created by writer Gerry Conway and artists John Romita Sr. and Ross Andru. The Punisher made his first appearance in "The Amazing Spider-Man" The Amazing Spider-Man 129|#129 (cover-dated February 1974), originally depicted as an Assassination|assassin and List of Spider-Man enemies|adversary of the superhero Spider-Man. The character is depicted as an Italian-American vigilante who employs murder, kidnapping, extortion, coercion, Assault (tort)|threats of violence, and torture in his campaign against crime. Driven by the deaths of his wife and two children, who were killed by the American Mafia|mob for witnessing a killing in New York City's Central Park, the Punisher wages a one-man war on crime.The Punisher's origin was first recounted in "Marvel Preview" #2 (July 1975).  A veteran (originally of the Vietnam War"The Punisher: Invades the 'Nam""Punisher" #6 (Marvel Comics, 2000). and later Retroactive continuity|updated alternately to the fictional Siancong War and the Iraq War)"History of the Marvel Universe" issue #2 (Marvel Comics 2019) United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps Scout/Sniper in United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon, Castle is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship. He is well known for the skull motif on his chest, originally envisioned by his creators as a Skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull-and-crossbones symbol on his right breast. Following the widespread appropriation of this logo by far-right politics|far-right movements, it was officially retired from active use by Marvel Entertainment in 2022, replaced by a new horned-skull motif inspired by the Japanese language|Japanese Japanese folklore|mythological demon "Oni". The Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him an anomaly in mainstream American comic books when he debuted in 1974. By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes. At the height of his popularity, the character was featured in four monthly publications: "The Punisher", "The Punisher War Journal", "The Punisher War Zone|The Punisher: War Zone", and "The Punisher Armory". An #Other versions|alternate future version of the character dubbed the Cosmic Ghost Rider, created by Donny Cates and Geoff Shaw, began publication in 2018 as a "Thanos" supporting character, becoming a breakout character and receiving his own ongoing series, often coming into opposition with his past self. In 2017, following the 2016 "Civil War II" storyline, where War Machine|Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes met his death at the hands of Thanos, Nick Fury, Jr. obtained the Iron Man's armor#War Machine armor|War Machine armor from a black market syndicate and persuaded Punisher to don the armor and carry on in Rhodes' name, succeeding him as the second "War Machine (comics)|War Machine" for a short while, customizing the armor with his skull motif."Punisher" #218-228 (2017-2018) Following Rhodes' resurrection alongside Tony Stark for the "Marvel Legacy" initiative, Castle relinquished the armor and title to him and resumed as Punisher. Despite his violent actions and dark nature, the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television, making guest appearances on series such as "Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man" and "The Super Hero Squad Show", where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers.  In feature films, Dolph Lundgren portrayed the character in the 1989 film "The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher", as did Thomas Jane in the 2004 film "The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher", and Ray Stevenson in 2008's "Punisher: War Zone". Jon Bernthal portrayed Frank Castle (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character in the Daredevil (season 2)|second season of "Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil" and the spin-off "The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher", set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). ==Publication history==   The Punisher was conceived by Gerry Conway, then-writer of "The Amazing Spider-Man", and was inspired by "The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner", a popular book series created by author Don Pendleton, in which a Vietnam veteran, Mack Bolan, becomes a serial killer of criminals after the American Mafia|Mafia-related deaths of his family. Conway said in a 1987 interview that "I was fascinated by the Don Pendleton Executioner character, which was fairly popular at the time, and I wanted to do something that was inspired by that, although not to my mind a copy of it. And while I was doing the Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal storyline, the opportunity came for a character who would be used by the Jackal to make Spider-Man's life miserable. The Punisher seemed to fit."Comics Interview #75 (1985) Conway also helped design the character's distinctive costume. As Conway recalled in 2002, "In the '70s, when I was writing comics at DC Comics|DC and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters—heroes and villains—which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel." Conway had drawn a character with a small Skull and crossbones (symbol)|death's head skull on one breast. Marvel art director John Romita, Sr. took the basic design and blew the skull up to huge size, taking up most of the character's chest.John Romita Sr., in  "Amazing Spider-Man" penciller Ross Andru was the first artist to draw the character for publication. Stan Lee, then Marvel's editor-in-chief, recalled in 2005 that he had suggested the character's name:  (transcript of 2005 interview)}} Appearing for the first time in "The Amazing Spider-Man" The Amazing Spider-Man 129|#129 (Feb. 1974), the Punisher was initially an antagonist of Spider-Man|the titular hero. He was portrayed as a bloodthirsty vigilante who had no qualms about killing gangsters, something which most superheroes of the time refrained from doing. J. Jonah Jameson described him as "the most newsworthy thing to happen to New York City|New York since William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed". In this appearance, the Punisher is determined to kill Spider-Man, who is wanted for the apparent murder of Norman Osborn."The Amazing Spider-Man" #129 (February 1974) The Punisher is shown as a formidable fighter, skilled marksman, and able strategist. All he reveals about himself is that he is a former U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marine. He has a fierce temper but also shows signs of considerable frustration over his self-appointed role of killer vigilante. He is engaged in extensive soul-searching as to what is the right thing to do: although he has few qualms about killing, he is outraged when his then-associate, the Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal, apparently kills an enemy by treacherous means rather than in honorable combat. Spider-Man, who is himself no stranger to such torment, concludes that the Punisher's problems made his own seem like a "birthday party". The character was a hit with readers and started to appear on a regular basis, teaming up with both Spider-Man and other heroes such as Captain America and Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler throughout the 1970s and early 1980s."The Amazing Spider-Man" #135, 161–162, 174–175, 201–202, "Annual" #15 (August 1974; October–November 1976; November–December 1977; February–March 1980; 1981)"Giant-Size Spider-Man" #4 (April 1975)"Captain America" #241 (January 1980) Conway said the Punisher's popularity took him by surprise, as he had intended him only as a second-tier character. During his acclaimed run on "Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil", writer and artist Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller made use of the character, contrasting his attitudes and version of vigilante action to that of the more liberal character of Daredevil."Daredevil" #181– ...
