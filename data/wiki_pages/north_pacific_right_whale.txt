The Northeast Pacific population, which summers in the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 40 animals. A western population that summers near the Commander Islands, the coast of Kamchatka, along the Kuril Islands and in the Sea of Okhotsk is thought to number in the low hundreds. Before commercial whaling in the North Pacific (i.e. pre-1835) there were probably over 20,000 right whales in the region. The taking of right whales in commercial whaling has been prohibited by one or more international treaties since 1935. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, illegal Soviet whaling killed at least 529 right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as at least 132 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk, plus an additional 104 North Pacific right whales from unspecified areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as "Endangered", and categorizes the Northeast Pacific population as "Critically Endangered". The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth., Center for Biological Diversity. == Taxonomy ==  Since 2000, scientists have considered the right whales in the North Pacific and nearby seas to be a separate species, "Eubalaena japonica", the North Pacific right whale. Genetic differences between "E. japonica" and "E. australis" are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.http://www.icrwhale.org/pdf/SC-F16-JR50.pdf  Before 2000, right whales in the North Pacific were considered conspecific with right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere and all described as "Eubalaena glacialis" in the scientific literature. All these animals resemble each other in outward appearance very closely. The differences that separate them into separate species are genetic and discussed in the article on Balaenidae.  The recognition of the different populations of "Eubalaena" whales as distinct species is supported by the Society for Marine Mammalogy, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the International Whaling Commission. The North Pacific, North Atlantic and Southern right whales are all members of the family Balaenidae.  The bowhead whale found in the Arctic is also a balaenid whale, but sufficiently different to warrant its own genus "Balaena". The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Pacific right whale and the other members of its family.  |cladogram=                     }}                   |label2=&nbsp;"Balaena" (bowhead whales)&nbsp;                   |2=&nbsp;"Bowhead whale|B. mysticetus" bowhead whale                 }}            }} |align=left }}  == Description == File:North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) - John Durban (NOAA).jpg|thumb|left|North Pacific right whale by John Durban, NOAA "E. japonica" is a very large, thickset baleen whale. It very closely resembles the North Atlantic right whale ("E. glacialis") the southern right whale ("E. australis"), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, "E. japonica" may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales. "E. japonica" is easily distinguished from other North Pacific whale species by several fieldmarks: lack of dorsal fin or bump, very broad, black back, cyamid-covered callosities on the head and lips, a very arched jaw line, a very narrow rostrum, and often a V-shaped spout.  North Pacific right whales can reach  in length as adults, larger than the North Atlantic right whale.

They are much larger than gray whale|gray or humpback whales and also being very stout, particularly when compared to the other large baleen whales such as blue whale|blue and fin whales. For 10 North Pacific right whales taken in the 1960s, their girth in front of the flippers was 0.73 of the total length of the whale. There have been claims that pectoral fins of pacific right whale are larger in portion than the other right whales and more pointed, and there may exist shape differences of tail by individuals or sex. Additionally, differences of coloration and shape (minor) of baleen plates between pacific and Atlantic have been noted. File:081012 scan 27.jpg|thumb|North Pacific right whale, Half Moon Bay, California, March 20, 1982, photo by Jim Scarff Right whales are also unique in that they all have Callosity|callosities—roughened patches of epidermis covered with thousands of small light-colored cyamids. The callosities appear in patches on its head immediately behind the blowholes, along the rostrum to the tip, which often has a large callosity, referred to by whalers as the "bonnet". The functional purpose of the callosities has not been determined. The closely related bowhead whale differs from the right whale by lacking any callosities, having a more arched jaw and longer baleen.  The seasonal ranges of the two species do not overlap. The bowhead whale is found at the edge of the pack ice in more Arctic waters in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea, and occurs in the Bering Sea only during winter. The bowhead whale is not found in the North Pacific. Although more than 15,000 right whales were killed by whalers in the North Pacific, there are remarkably few detailed descriptions of these whales. Most of our information about the anatomy and morphology of "E. japonica" comes from 13 whales killed by Japanese whalers in the 1960s and 10 whales killed by Russian whalers in the 1950s. Basic information about right whale lengths and sex are also available from coastal whaling operations in the early part of the 20th century. == Ecology and behavior ==  Like right whales in other oceans, North Pacific right whales feed primarily on copepods, mainly the species "Calanus marshallae".  They also have been reported off Japan and in the Gulf of Alaska, feeding on copepods of the genus "Neocalanus" with a small quantity of euphausiid larvae, "Euphausia pacifica". Like other right whale species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by skimming water continuously while swimming; this is in contrast to balaenopterid whales, such as the blue and humpback whales, which engulf prey in rapid lunges, surging upward rapidly from the depths. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead, they have very large heads and mouths that allow them to swim with their mouths open (similar to the basking shark|basking and whale sharks); the water with the copepods flows in, then flows sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips. The mouth is then closed tightly to expel the excess water, with the prey being effectively trapped in the whale's mouth, behind the baleen. It takes millions of the tiny copepods to provide the energy a right whale needs. Thus, right whales must find copepods at very high concentrations, greater than 3,000 per cubic meter to feed efficiently. National Marine Fisheries Service researchers mapped the southeast Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska for areas with sufficient productivity to support such concentrations, and analyzed the roles of bathymetry and various Oceanic gyre|gyres in concentrating copepods to such densities.    ...
