There was also an air-to-air version, the Hs 117H. The operators used a telescopic sight and a joystick to guide the missile by radio control, which was detonated by Acoustics|acoustic and Photoelectric effect|photoelectric proximity fuses, at . == Development == In 1941, Professor Herbert A. Wagner (who was previously responsible for the Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missile) invented the Schmetterling missile and submitted it to the Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|Reich Air Ministry (RLM), who rejected the design because there was no need for more anti-aircraft weaponry. However, by 1943 the Defence of the Reich|large-scale bombing of Germany caused the RLM to change its mind, and Henschel was given a contract to develop and manufacture it. The team was led by Professor Wagner, and it produced a weapon somewhat resembling a bottlenose dolphin with swept wings and cruciform tail. In May 1944, 59 Hs 117 missiles were tested, some from beneath a Heinkel He 111; over half the trials failed. Mass production was ordered in December 1944, with deployment to start in March 1945. Operational missiles were to be launched from a 37mm gun carriage. In January 1945, a prototype for mass production was completed, and production of 3,000 missiles a month was anticipated, but on 6 February, Obergruppenführer|"SS-Obergruppenführer" Hans Kammler cancelled the project. == Variants == The "Hs 117H" was an air-launched variant, designed to be launched from a Dornier Do 217, Junkers Ju 188, or Junkers Ju 388. This version was designed to attack enemy aircraft up to  above the launching aircraft. == See also ==  == References ==  *  *  ==External links==  *  *     Category:World War II guided missiles of Germany Category:Surface-to-air missiles of Germany
