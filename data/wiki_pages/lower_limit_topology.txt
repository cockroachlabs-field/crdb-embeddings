 In mathematics, the "lower limit topology" or "right half-open interval topology" is a topological space|topology defined on the set <math>\mathbb{R}</math> of real numbers; it is different from the standard topology on <math>\mathbb{R}</math> (generated by the open intervals) and has a number of interesting properties. It is the topology generated by the basis (topology)|basis of all half-open intervals <nowiki></math> contains no point of <math>C</math> apart from <math>x</math>. This is true for all <math>x\in C</math>. Now choose a rational number <math>q(x) \in (a(x), x]\cap\mathbb{Q}</math>. Since the intervals <math>(a(x), x]</math>, parametrized by <math>x \in C</math>, are pairwise disjoint, the function <math>q: C \to \mathbb{Q}</math> is injective, and so <math>C</math> is at most countable. It could be observed that a subset <math>C</math> is compact if and only if it bounded from below and is well-ordered when endowed with the order "<math>></math>" (which in particular implies that it is bounded from above). * The name "lower limit topology" comes from the following fact: a sequence (or net (topology)|net) <math>(x_\alpha)</math> in <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> converges to the limit <math>L</math> if and only if it "approaches <math>L</math> from the right", meaning for every <math>\epsilon>0</math> there exists an index <math>\alpha_0</math> such that <math>\forall\alpha \geq \alpha_0 : L \leq x_\alpha < L+\epsilon</math>. The Sorgenfrey line can thus be used to study right-sided limits: if <math>f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</math> is a function (mathematics)|function, then the  ordinary right-sided limit of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math> (when the codomain carries the standard topology) is the same as the usual limit of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math> when the domain is equipped with the lower limit topology and the codomain carries the standard topology. * In terms of separation axioms, <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> is a perfectly normal Hausdorff space. * In terms of axiom of countability|countability axioms, <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> is first-countable space|first-countable and separable space|separable, but not second-countable space|second-countable. * In terms of compactness properties, <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> is Lindelöf space|Lindelöf and paracompact, but not σ-compact space|σ-compact nor locally compact. * <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> is not metrizable, since separable metric spaces are second-countable. However, the topology of a Sorgenfrey line is generated by a Metric (mathematics)#Quasimetrics|quasimetric. * <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> is a Baire space. * <math>\mathbb{R}_l</math> does not have any connected compactifications.Adam Emeryk, Władysław Kulpa.
