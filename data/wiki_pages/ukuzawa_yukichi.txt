Fukuzawa was an early advocate for reform in Japan. His ideas about the organization of government and the structure of social institutions made a lasting impression on a rapidly changing Japan during the Meiji period. He appears on the current 10,000-Japanese yen banknote. == Early life == File:Hotarumachi-Nakatsuhan-Monument.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of Fukuzawa Yukichi's birthplace, the Nakatsu Domain warehouse-mansion, in Hotarumachi, Fukushima-ku, Osaka Fukuzawa Yukichi was born into an impoverished low-ranking samurai (military nobility) family of the Okudaira Clan of Nakatsu Domain (present-day Ōita Prefecture|Ōita, Kyushu) in 1835. His family lived in Osaka, the main trading center for Japan at the time. His family was poor following the early death of his father, who was also a Confucian scholar. At the age of 5 he started Han learning, and by the time he turned 14, he had studied major writings such as the "Analects", "Tao Te Ching", "Zuo Zhuan" and "Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi". Fukuzawa was greatly influenced by his lifelong teacher, Shōzan Shiraishi, who was a scholar of Confucianism and Han learning. Yukichi turned 19 in 1854, shortly after the Perry Expedition's arrival in Japan marking the beginning of the opening of Japan to trade via Gunboat diplomacy. As the family patriarch Fukuzawa's brother asked him to travel to Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, where the Netherlands|Dutch colony at Dejima was located, in order to enter a school of Dutch studies "(rangaku). " He instructed Yukichi to learn Dutch language|Dutch so that he might study European cannon designs and gunnery.

Fukuzawa’s early life consisted of the dull and backbreaking work typical of a lower-level samurai in Japan during the Tokugawa period. Although Fukuzawa did travel to Nagasaki, his stay was brief as he quickly began to outshine his host in Nagasaki, Okudaira Iki. Okudaira planned to get rid of Fukuzawa by writing a letter saying that Fukuzawa's mother was ill.  Seeing through the fake letter, Fukuzawa planned to travel to Edo and continue his studies there, since he would be unable to do so in his home domain of Nakatsu. However, upon his return to Osaka, his brother persuaded him to stay and enroll at the Teki juku|Tekijuku school run by physician and "rangaku" scholar Ogata Kōan. Fukuzawa studied at Tekijuku for three years and became fully proficient in the Dutch language. In 1858, he was appointed the official Dutch teacher of Nakatsu, and was sent to Edo to teach the family's vassals there. The following year, Japan opened up three of its ports to American and European ships, and Fukuzawa, intrigued with Western culture|Western civilization, traveled to Kanagawa to see them. When he arrived, he discovered that virtually all of the European merchants there were speaking English language|English rather than Dutch. He then began to study English, but at that time, English-Japanese interpreters were rare and dictionaries nonexistent, so his studies were slow. In 1859, the Tokugawa shogunate sent Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|their first diplomatic mission to the United States. Fukuzawa volunteered his services to Admiral Kimura Yoshitake. Kimura's ship, the Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|"Kanrin Maru", arrived in San Francisco, California, in 1860. The delegation stayed in the city for a month, during which time Fukuzawa had himself photographed with an American girl, and also found a "Webster's Dictionary", from which he began serious study of the English language. == Political movements == File:Japanese-Embassy-to-the-United-States-Group-Photo-1860.png|thumb|left|200px|Fukuzawa Yukichi was a member of the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860).

File:Fukuzawa Yukichi in Utrecht 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fukuzawa posing in Utrecht as part of the First Japanese Embassy to Europe (1862)|First Japanese Embassy to Europe, 1862. Upon his return in 1860, Fukuzawa became an official translator for the Tokugawa shogunate. Shortly afterwards he brought out his first publication, an English-Japanese dictionary which he called "Kaei Tsūgo" (translated from a Chinese language|Chinese-English dictionary) which was a beginning for his series of later books. In 1862, he visited Europe as one of the two English translators in the First Japanese Embassy to Europe (1862)|First Japanese Embassy to Europe. During its year in Europe, the Embassy conducted negotiations with France, England, the Netherlands, Prussia, and finally Russia. In Russia, the embassy attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate for the southern end of Sakhalin (in Japanese Karafuto Prefecture|Karafuto), a long-standing source of dispute between the two countries. The information collected during these travels resulted in his famous work "Seiyō Jijō" (, ), which he published in ten volumes in 1867, 1868 and 1870. The books describe western culture and institutions in simple, easy to understand terms, and they became immediate best-sellers. Fukuzawa was soon regarded as the foremost expert on western civilization, leading him to conclude that his mission in life was to educate his countrymen in new ways of thinking in order to enable Japan to resist European imperialism. In 1868 he changed the name of the school he had established to teach Dutch to Keio Gijuku (Gakkou Houjin)|Keio Gijuku, and from then on devoted all his time to education. He also added Public speaking to the educational system's curriculum. While Keiō's initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies (Keio-gijuku), it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890. Under the name Keio-Gijuku University, it became a leader in Japanese higher education. Fukuzawa was also a strong advocate for Feminism in Japan|women’s rights. He often spoke up in favor of equality between husbands and wives, the education of girls as well as boys, and the equal love of daughters and sons. At the same time, he called attention to harmful practices such as women’s inability to own property in their own name and the familial distress that took place when married men took mistresses. However, even Fukuzawa was not willing to propose completely equal rights for men and women; only for husbands and wives. He also stated in his 1899 book "New Greater Learning for Women" that a good marriage was always the best outcome for a young woman, and according to some of Fukuzawa's personal letters, he discouraged his friends from sending their daughters on to higher education so that they would not become less desirable marriage candidates. While some of Yukichi’s other proposed reforms, such as education reforms, found an eager audience, his ideas about women received a less enthusiastic reception. == Death == After suffering a stroke on January 25, 1901, Fukuzawa Yukichi died on February 3. He was buried at Zenpuku-ji, in the Azabu area of Tokyo. Alumni of Keio-Gijuku University hold a ceremony there every year on February 3. == Works == Fukuzawa's writings may have been the foremost of the Edo period and Meiji period. They played a large role in the introduction of Western culture into Japan.  In 1860, he published "English-Japanese Dictionary" ("Zōtei Kaei Tsūgo").  It was his first publication.  He bought "English-Chinese Dictionary" ("Kaei Tsūgo") in San Francisco in 1860.  He translated it to Japanese and he added the Japanese translations to the original textbook.  In his book, he invented the new U_(kana)#Variant_forms|Japanese characters VU () to represent the pronunciation of VU, and VA () to represent the pronunciation of VA.  For example, the name Beethoven is written as  in modern Japanese.  His famous textbook "Sekai Kunizukushi" ("All the Countries of the World, for Children Written in Verse", 1869) became a best seller and was used as an official school textbook.  His inspiration for writing the books came when he tried to teach world geography to his sons.  At the time there were no textbooks on the subject, so he decided to write one himself.  He started by buying a few Japanese geography books for children, named "Miyakoji" ("City roads") and "Edo hōgaku" ("Tokyo maps"), and practiced reading them aloud. He then wrote "Sekai Kunizukushi" in six volumes in the same lyrical style.  The first volume covered Asia, the second Africa, the third Europe, the fourth South America, and the fifth both North America and Australia. The sixth volume was an appendix that gave an introduction to world  geography.  File:Gakumon-no-susume.jpg|thumb|200px|First edition of "" (1872), written by Fukuzawa Yukichi and Obata Tokujirō. Influenced by the 1835 and 1856 editions of "Elements of Moral Science" by Brown University President Francis Wayland, from 1872-76 Fukuzawa published 17 volumes of "Gakumon no Susume" (,  or more idiomatically "On Studying").  Through these writings, Fukuzawa develops his views on the importance of equality of opportunity as a principle, explores his understanding of the principle, and stresses that education is the key to taking best advantage of  the principle and achieving greatness. For these reasons, he was an avid supporter of public schools and believed in a firm mental foundation through learning and studiousness. Fukuzawa also advocated in these writings his most lasting motto, "national independence through personal independence." By creating a self-determining social morality for a Japan still reeling from both the political upheavals wrought by the unwanted end to its isolationism and the cultural upheavals caused by the inundation of so much novelty in products, methods, and ideas, Fukuzawa hoped to instill a sense of personal strength among the people of Japan so they could build a nation to rival all others. To his understanding, Western nations had become more powerful than other regions because their societies fostered education, individualism (independence), competition and exchange of ideas.   File:文明論之概略.png|thumb|200px|First edition of "" (1875). Fukuzawa published many influential essays and critical works. A particularly prominent example is "Bunmeiron no Gairyaku" (, ) published in 1875, in which he details his own theory of civilization. It was influenced by "Histoire de la civilisation en Europe" (1828; Eng. trans in 1846) by François Guizot and "History of Civilization in England" (1872–1873, 2nd London ed.) by Henry Thomas Buckle. According to Fukuzawa, civilization is relative to time and circumstance, as well in comparison. For example, at the time China was relatively civilized in comparison to some African colonies, and European nations were the most civilized of all. Colleagues in the Meirokusha intellectual society shared many of Fukuzawa's views, which he published in his contributions to "Meiroku zasshi" (Meiji Six Magazine), a scholarly journal he helped publish. In his books and journals, he often wrote about the word "civilization" and what it meant. He advocated a move toward "civilization", by which he meant material and spiritual well-being, which elevated human life to a "higher plane". Because material and spiritual well-being corresponded to knowledge and "virtue", to "move toward civilization" was to advance and pursue knowledge and virtue themselves. He contended that people could find the answer to their life or their present situation from "civilization." Furthermore, the difference between the weak and the powerful and large and small was just a matter of difference between their knowledge and education. He argued that Japan should not import guns and materials. Instead it should support the acquisition of knowledge, which would eventually take care of the material necessities. He talked of the Japanese concept of being practical or pragmatic (wikt:実学|実学, "jitsugaku") and the building of things that are basic and useful to other people. In short, to Fukuzawa, "civilization" essentially meant the furthering of knowledge and education. == Legacy == File:Yukichi Fukuzawa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Fukuzawa Yukichi Fukuzawa's most important contribution to the reformation effort, though, came in the form of a newspaper called  (, "Current Events"), which he started in 1882, after being prompted by Inoue Kaoru, Ōkuma Shigenobu, and Itō Hirobumi to establish a strong influence among the people, and in particular to transmit to the public the government's views on the projected Government of Meiji Japan#Establishment of a national assembly|national assembly, and as reforms began, Fukuzawa, whose fame was already unquestionable, began production of "Jiji Shinpo", which received wide circulation, encouraging the people to enlighten themselves and to adopt a moderate political attitude towards the change that was being en ...
