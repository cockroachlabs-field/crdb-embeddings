 This article contains a list of "magic tricks". In magic literature, tricks are often called "effects". Based on published literature and marketed effects, there are millions of effects; a short performance routine by a single magician may contain dozens of such effects. Some students of Magic (illusion)|magic strive to refer to effects using a proper name, and also to properly attribute an effect to its creator. For example, consider an effect in which a magician shows four aces, and then the aces turn face up one at a time in a mysterious fashion. This effect, recognized as "Twisting the Aces", is attributed to Dai Vernon, and it is based on a false count invented by Alex Elmsley. Some tricks are listed merely with their marketed name (particularly those sold as stand-alone tricks by retail dealers), whereas others are listed by the name given within magic publications. ==Magic tricks== *Assistant's Revenge *Aztec Lady *Battle of the Barrels *Bill in lemon|Bill in Lemon *Book test *Bullet catch|Bullet Catch *Cabinet escape|Cabinet Escape *Chinese linking rings|Chinese Linking Rings *Chinese Water Torture Cell *Cut and restore rope trick|Cut and Restore Rope Trick *David Copperfield's laser illusion|David Copperfield's Laser Illusion *Dove pan|Dove Pan *Devil's torture chamber|Devil's Torture Chamber *Dismemberment (illusion)|Dismemberment *Drill of Death *Guillotine (magic trick)|Guillotine *Impalement (magic trick)|Impalement *Indian rope trick|Indian Rope Trick *Inexhaustible bottle *Several varieties of Levitation (illusion)|Levitation *Miser's Dream *Metamorphosis (illusion)|Metamorphosis *Needle-through-arm *Origami (magic trick)|Origami *Predicament escape|Predicament Escape *Quick-change (performance)|Quick-change *Radium Girl *Sands of the Nile *Several variations of Sawing a woman in half|Sawing a Woman in Half, including the Zig Zag Girl and Mismade Girl *Squeeze box (magic trick)|Squeeze Box (as created by Andr√© Kole) *Table of Death *Thumper (magic trick) *Wringer (magic trick)|Wringer  Image:Floatingmatchoncard.nwr.jpg|thumbnail|Floating match on card Image:FrenchDrop1.jpg|thumb|right|The French drop. * Ambitious card|Ambitious Card * Blackstone's Card Trick Without Cards * Card warp|Card Warp * Chink-a-chink * The Circus Card Trick * Cups and balls|Cups and Balls * Detachable thumb|Detachable Thumb * Floating match on card|Floating Match on Card * French drop|French Drop (The Tourniquet) * Glorpy * Healed and Sealed * Hot foil trick|Hot Foil Trick * Hummer card|Hummer Card * Needle Through Thumb * Retention of vision vanish|Retention of Vision Vanish (Pinch Vanish) * Scotch and soda (magic trick)|Scotch and Soda * Snapper (puzzle) * The Best Coin Fold * The Four Burglars * Three card monte|Three Card Monte * Zarrow shuffle|Zarrow Shuffle  Image:Kingrisinglevitation2.nwr.jpg|thumb|right|The king levitation being performed * Asrah levitation|Asrah Levitation * Balducci levitation|Balducci Levitation * King Rising Levitation * David Copperfield's flying|David Copperfield's Flying == Utilities/accessories == Thousands of devices are used by magicians to accomplish their effects.
