   File:Cheyne Walk - geograph.org.uk - 1380761.jpg|thumb|Cheyne Walk seen from across the river "Cheyne Walk" is a historic road in Chelsea, London, England, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It runs parallel with the River Thames. Before the construction of Chelsea Embankment reduced the width of the Thames here, it fronted the river along its whole length. ==Location== At its western end, Cheyne Walk meets Cremorne Road end-on at the junction with Lots Road. The Walk runs alongside the River Thames until Battersea Bridge where, for a short distance, it is replaced by Chelsea Embankment with part of its former alignment being occupied by Ropers Gardens. East of Old Church Street and Chelsea Old Church, the Walk runs along the north side of Albert Bridge Gardens and Chelsea Embankment Gardens parallel with Chelsea Embankment. At the north end of Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge, the Walk merges with Chelsea Embankment. The Walk ends at Royal Hospital Road.  At the western end between Lots Road and Battersea Bridge is a collection of residential houseboats that have been "in situ" since the 1930s. At the eastern end is the Chelsea Physic Garden with its cedars. It marks the boundary of the, now withdrawn, extended London congestion charge|London Congestion Charge Zone. The section west of Battersea Bridge forms part of the A3220 road. ==History== File:Cheyne Walk, London, c late 18th-early 19th century. People strolling by the banks of the River Thames in the distance is Chelsea Old Church MoL.jpg|thumb|Cheyne Walk circa 1800. Cheyne Walk takes its name from William Cheyne, 2nd Viscount Newhaven|William Cheyne, Viscount Newhaven who owned the Chelsea Manor|manor of Chelsea until 1712. Most of the houses were built in the early 18th century. Before the construction in the 19th century of the busy Chelsea Embankment, which now runs in front of it, the houses fronted the River Thames. The most prominent building is Carlyle Mansions. Chelsea Old Church dates from 1157 and Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall is a reconstructed medieval merchant's house relocated from the City of London in 1910. In 1951, the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea planned to construct a new river wall straightening the river bank west of Battersea Bridge. On the reclaimed land behind the wall a new arterial road and public gardens was to be constructed. Cheyne Walk was to remain unchanged to the north of the new public gardens. The works would have reduced the foreshore and required the removal of the house boat births. The works did not take place. In the 1960s, plans for the Greater London Council's London Ringways#Ringway 1|London Motorway Box project would have seen the West Cross Route, a motorway standard elevated road, constructed from Battersea to Harlesden through Earl's Court. A spur road would have been constructed from the motorway to the junction of Cheyne Walk and Lots Road. The plans were abandoned because of the cost and opposition from local communities. In 1972, number 96 Cheyne Walk, the then home of Philip Woodfield, a British civil servant, was the site of a top secret meeting between the British government and the leadership of the Provisional IRA aimed at ending the violence in Northern Ireland. The talks were inconclusive and the violence soon started again. ==Notable residents==  Many famous people have lived (and continue to live) in the Walk: File:4 Cheyne Walk GE ILN 1881.jpg|thumb|4 Cheyne Walk, shown here in 1881, was briefly the home of George Eliot File:5 Cheyne Walk 01.JPG|thumb|4 and 5 Cheyne Walk File:15 Cheyne Walk 02.JPG|thumb|15 Cheyne Walk File:16 Cheyne Walk 05.JPG|thumb|16 Cheyne Walk, home to Dante Gabriel Rossetti No. 1: * Samuel Prout Newcombe (b. 1824) entrepreneur, leased the property from the ground landlord, the George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan|Earl Cadogan, in 1891 shortly after it had been rebuilt.
