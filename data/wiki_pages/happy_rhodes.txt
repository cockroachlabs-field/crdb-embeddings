A family legend claims that Stamper wrote the well-known song "Shine On, Harvest Moon" in 1903 for Nora Bayes when he was working as her Vaudeville piano accompanist, but sold the rights and credit to Bayes and her husband Jack Norworth. Rhodes' parents divorced when she was young. Rhodes has two brothers who are twins. == Musical background == File:HappyRhodes3.png|thumb|left|Happy Rhodes at the Tin Angel<br />Philadelphia, PA 1996 Rhodes received her first musical instrument, an acoustic guitar, as a gift from her mother, at age 11. At 14 she was performing original songs in school shows. She left school early at age 16, choosing to obtain a GED. From age 16 to 18, Rhodes began performing in open mic nights at Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs, New York. During this period, Rhodes met Pat Tessitore, the owner of a recording studio, Cathedral Sound Studios in Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer, and became a studio intern to learn recording techniques. Tessitore was impressed with Rhodes' voice and songwriting, and volunteered to record all of the songs she had written to that point. Tessitore introduced Rhodes to Kevin Bartlett (musician)|Kevin Bartlett, a musician who had his own record label, Aural Gratification, and he urged her to gather up all the songs that she had recorded, to be released on cassette. She had enough songs to release three cassettes at the same time in 1986, "Rhodes Vol. I", "Rhodes Vol. II", and "Rearmament". In 1987, she released the cassette of "Ecto". Her first CD release was "Warpaint", in 1991. The first four albums were only available on hand-dubbed cassettes until they were re-released on CD in 1992. For the CD releases, "Rhodes Vol. I" was renamed "Rhodes I", and "Rhodes Vol. II" was renamed "Rhodes II". Each of the CD re-releases contained bonus tracks not on the original cassettes. Aural Gratification released nine Happy Rhodes albums between 1986 and 1995, including "Equipoise" and "RhodeSongs" in 1993, "Building The Colossus" in 1994 and "The Keep" in 1995. Rhodes left Aural Gratification in 1998. Rhodes' 10th album, "Many Worlds Are Born Tonight", was released in August 1998 by Samson Music, a label founded by Norm Waitt Jr., brother of Ted Waitt, co-founder of the Gateway, Inc.|Gateway Computer company. Rhodes was dropped from Samson when the label decided to concentrate on other genres of music and Samson transferred rights to the material back to Rhodes, as well as unsold product. In 2001, Rhodes recorded an 11th album, called "Find Me (Happy Rhodes album)|Find Me", which was released October 19, 2007. Rhodes married musician Bob Muller in 2006 and they currently live on a farm in central upstate New York. == Influences == Rhodes has cited Wendy Carlos, Kate Bush, Queen (band)|Queen, Yes (band)|Yes, David Bowie, Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach and Peter Gabriel as primary influences. Her father owned a large record collection which included Bagpipes|Bagpipe music and Switched-On Bach, by Wendy Carlos. By age nine, Rhodes could sing along with every note from that album. As a teenager she discovered the music of Queen (band)|Queen and was impressed by their harmonies, which she later emulated on her first few albums. When Rhodes was introduced at age 16 to Kate Bush's music by an English pen pal, she was impressed by Bush's original writing style, vocal abilities and independence as a female artist. Rhodes has cited Bach's Air on a G String as her favorite piece of music. == Live performances == Most of her live shows have been in the northeast of America, primarily Philadelphia and New York City. Rhodes has sold out every show she's performed in Philadelphia when she was the headliner. She has performed several times at the Tin Angel, where she always plays two shows in an evening. Rhodes has also played The Middle East (nightclub)|The Middle East Club in 1995, the Mann Theater (opening for 10,000 Maniacs) and the University Museum Auditorium, both in 1992.

Though the tour received positive reviews,|access-date=August 30, 2012|quote=Her music is lush yet edgy, ambitious yet accessible, beautiful yet dark. The songs showcase Rhodes' extraordinary vocal abilities as her voice glides effortlessly from a deep, warm, wrap-me-in-your-arms lower register (utilized to best effect during a daring interpretation of David Bowie's Space Oddity, her only cover selection of the night) to soaring angelic high notes.}} it was not an economic success due to the ambitious multimedia presentation of the material.|access-date=August 30, 2012|quote="It's a multimedia show with two projection screens, films, a five-piece backing band and my own lighting rig", Rhodes explained last week during a break in rehearsals at her home just outside Woodstock.}}  In 1999 Meredith Tarr of New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven and Chuck Stipak of Danbury, Connecticut organized a one-day music festival in Danbury to honor Rhodes and the mailing list Ecto, with all proceeds going to charity. The lineup for "Ectofest 1999," held on September 4, 1999, consisted of Rhodes, Rachael Sage, Sloan Wainwright, Susan McKeown and the Mila Drumke Band. Tarr and Stipak repeated the festival the next year and on September 2, 2000 "Ectofest 2000" featured Rhodes, Jessica Weiser, Anne Heaton (folk singer)|Anne Heaton, Amy Fairchild, Sloan Wainwright, Merrie Amsterburg and Susan McKeown. In 2001, West Coast fans (Shelly Deforte, Phil Hudson and Bill Mazur), who were encouraged by other members of the Ecto music discussion group to host a West coast version of the event, organized "Ectofest West" in Santa Cruz, California, held on June 9, 2001, at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center. Rhodes flew to California to perform but on the day of the concert she accidentally cut the ring finger on her fret hand while using a Leatherman tool, and severed the deep flexor tendon, as well as causing nerve damage. She was taken to the hospital where the hand was temporarily treated and bandaged. Rhodes performed 12 songs that evening sans guitar, relying on bandmates Eric Nicholas, Carl Adami and Bob Muller to fill in her parts. Rhodes had surgery on the finger when she returned from California and underwent physical therapy so she could play the guitar again. Ectofest West is the only time Rhodes has performed in front of an audience west of Chicago.

Performers at that show were Edie Carey, Mila Drumke, Trina Hamlin, Jargon Society, Rachael Sage and Molly Zenobia. 2001's show was the last Ectofest until the 2007 Ectofest with Happy Rhodes, Noe Venable and Casey Desmond on September 8, 2007, at / the Lily Pad in Cambridge, MA. The show sold out 3 weeks in advance, with fans traveling from all over the United States and also Scotland and Germany.  In 2016, Rhodes came out of retirement and started singing with Security Project, a Peter Gabriel appreciation band featuring Jerry Marotta, Trey Gunn, Michael Cozzi, and David Jameson, singing lead for 11 live shows in 2016, 19 shows in 2017, and 8 more shows in Spring 2018.  * After 2001's Ectofest West, Rhodes did not perform again until April 2003, when she performed at a house concert in New Haven with percussionist Bob Muller.
