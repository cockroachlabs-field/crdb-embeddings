The range is an offshoot of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada. The range is named after Cathedral Peak (California)|Cathedral Peak, which resembles a cathedral spire. ==Geography== The range includes Cathedral Peak, Unicorn Peak, Eichorn Pinnacle, Echo Peaks (Toulumne Meadows)|Echo Peaks, Echo Ridge, Matthes Crest, Rafferty Peak, Vogelsang Peak, Fletcher Peak and Cockscomb (Tuolumne Meadows)|Cockscomb. The highest point in the range is Mount Florence (Yosemite)|Mount Florence, one of the most prominent peaks in the Yosemite high country. The highest peak in Tuolumne Meadows is Johnson Peak (Tuolumne Meadows)|Johnson Peak. The range runs beside the two Cathedral Lakes, just one mile southwest of Cathedral Peak. Hikers can access the lakes and Cathedral range by the John Muir Trail|John Muir trail from the trailhead in Tuolumne Meadows. ==Geology== The mountains were formed by glaciers carving out the granite material; also see Cathedral Peak Granodiorite. The tops of the peaks in the range were above the level of the highest glaciation, and are therefore un-eroded and distinctly spire-like; see nunatak. ==References==  }} Category:Landforms of Yosemite National Park Category:Mountain ranges of Madera County, California Category:Mountain ranges of Tuolumne County, California Category:Mountain ranges of Mariposa County, California Category:Mountain ranges of the Sierra Nevada (United States) Category:Mountain ranges of Northern California
