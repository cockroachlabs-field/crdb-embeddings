Design studies were performed by Grumman Aerospace Corporation in collaboration with Gulfstream American Corporation.  Design of the Gulfstream III started with an effort to synthesize a completely new wing employing NASA supercritical airfoil sections and winglets. Optimization studies considering weight, drag, fuel volume, cost, and performance indicated that a substantial portion of the new wing benefit could be secured with modifications to the existing wing. As a result, the new wing concept was canceled and work began on design modifications that would retain the Gulfstream II wing box structure and trailing edge surfaces.Boppe, Charles W., "Computational Aerodynamic Design: X-29, the Gulfstream Series and a Tactical Fighter", SAE paper 851789, 1985 Wright Brothers Award Paper, presented at the Aerospace Technology Conference & Exposition, Long Beach California, October 1985. Compared to the Gulfstream II|G-1159 Gulfstream II, the wing has  more span and  winglets added, the leading edge is longer and its contour is modified. The fuselage is  longer aft of the main door, the radome is extended and there is a new curved windshield. Maximum takeoff weight is increased to  or  and there are various changes to the autopilot, flight instruments, and engine instruments. The aircraft received its type certificate from the American Federal Aviation Administration on 22 September 1980. A total of 202 Gulfstream IIIs were built, with the last example built in 1986. In 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015.  The Gulfstream III is listed explicitly in Federal Register .  Any Gulfstream IIIs that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had "hushkits" installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015.  "14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less" – lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015. By 2018, prices for a used 1982 Gulfstream III started at $695,000. ==Variants==  File:HZ-NR2-GulfstreamIII-304.jpg|thumb|Gulfstream III in 1981 * "Model G-1159A Gulfstream III" - Two or three-crew executive, corporate transport aircraft, powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines.  * "C-20A" - United States Air Force variant configured for 14 passengers and five crew; phased out of USAF service in 2002, one example transferred to NASA for use at the Neil A.
