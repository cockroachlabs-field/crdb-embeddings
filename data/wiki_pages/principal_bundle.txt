 In mathematics, a "principal bundle" page 35  page 42  page 37  page 370 is a mathematical object that formalizes some of the essential features of the Cartesian product <math>X \times G</math> of a space <math>X</math> with a group (mathematics)|group <math>G</math>. In the same way as with the Cartesian product, a principal bundle <math>P</math> is equipped with # An Group action (mathematics)|action of <math>G</math> on <math>P</math>, analogous to <math>(x, g)h = (x, gh)</math> for a product space. # A projection onto <math>X</math>. For a product space, this is just the projection onto the first factor, <math>(x,g) \mapsto x</math>. Unlike a product space, principal bundles lack a preferred choice of identity cross-section; they have no preferred analog of <math>(x,e)</math>. Likewise, there is not generally a projection onto <math>G</math> generalizing the projection onto the second factor, <math>X \times G \to G</math> that exists for the Cartesian product. They may also have a complicated topology that prevents them from being realized as a product space even if a number of arbitrary choices are made to try to define such a structure by defining it on smaller pieces of the space. A common example of a principal bundle is the frame bundle <math>F(E)</math> of a vector bundle <math>E</math>, which consists of all ordered basis of a vector space|bases of the vector space attached to each point.  The group <math>G,</math> in this case, is the general linear group, which acts on the right Frame bundle#Definition and construction|in the usual way: by change of basis|changes of basis.  Since there is no natural way to choose an ordered basis of a vector space, a frame bundle lacks a canonical choice of identity cross-section. Principal bundles have important applications in topology and differential geometry and mathematical gauge theory (mathematics)|gauge theory. They have also found application in physics where they form part of the foundational framework of physical gauge theory|gauge theories.   ==Formal definition== A principal <math>G</math>-bundle, where <math>G</math> denotes any topological group, is a fiber bundle <math>\pi:P \to X</math> together with a continuous (topology)|continuous Group action (mathematics)|right action <math>P \times G \to P</math> such that <math>G</math> preserves the fibers of <math>P</math> (i.e. if <math>y \in P_x</math> then <math>yg \in P_x</math> for all <math>g \in G</math>) and acts free action|freely and transitive action|transitively (meaning each fiber is a torsor|G-torsor) on them in such a way that for each <math>x \in X</math> and <math>y \in P_x</math>, the map <math>G \to P_x</math> sending <math>g</math> to <math>yg</math> is a homeomorphism. In particular each fiber of the bundle is homeomorphic to the group <math>G</math> itself. Frequently, one requires the base space <math>X</math> to be Hausdorff space|Hausdorff and possibly paracompact. Since the group action preserves the fibers of <math>\pi:P \to X</math> and acts transitively, it follows that the orbit (group theory)|orbits of the <math>G</math>-action are precisely these fibers and the orbit space <math>P/G</math> is homeomorphic to the base space <math>X</math>. Because the action is free and transitive, the fibers have the structure of G-torsors. A <math>G</math>-torsor is a space that is homeomorphic to <math>G</math> but lacks a group structure since there is no preferred choice of an identity element. An equivalent definition of a principal <math>G</math>-bundle is as a <math>G</math>-bundle <math>\pi:P \to X</math> with fiber <math>G</math> where the structure group acts on the fiber by left multiplication. Since right multiplication by <math>G</math> on the fiber commutes with the action of the structure group, there exists an invariant notion of right multiplication by <math>G</math> on <math>P</math>. The fibers of <math>\pi</math> then become right <math>G</math>-torsors for this action. The definitions above are for arbitrary topological spaces. One can also define principal <math>G</math>-bundles in the category (mathematics)|category of smooth manifolds. Here <math>\pi:P \to X</math> is required to be a smooth map between smooth manifolds, <math>G</math> is required to be a Lie group, and the corresponding action on <math>P</math> should be smooth. ==Examples==  Over an open ball <math>U \subset \mathbb{R}^n</math>, or <math>\mathbb{R}^n</math>, with induced coordinates <math>x_1,\ldots,x_n</math>, any principal <math>G</math>-bundle is isomorphic to a trivial bundle<blockquote><math>\pi:U\times G \to U</math></blockquote>and a smooth section <math>s \in \Gamma(\pi)</math> is equivalently given by a (smooth) function <math>\hat{s}: U \to G</math> since<blockquote><math>s(u) = (u,\hat{s}(u)) \in U\times G </math></blockquote>for some smooth function. For example, if <math>G=U(2)</math>, the Lie group of <math>2\times 2</math> Unitary matrix|unitary matrices, then a section can be constructed by considering four real-valued functions<blockquote><math>\phi(x),\psi(x),\Delta(x),\theta(x) : U \to \mathbb{R}</math></blockquote>and applying them to the parameterization <math display="block">U = e^{i\phi(x) /2}\begin{bmatrix}  e^{i\psi(x)} & 0 \\  0 & e^{-i\psi(x)} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  \cos \theta(x)  & \sin \theta(x) \\  -\sin \theta(x) & \cos \theta(x) \\ \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix}  e^{i\Delta(x)} & 0 \\  0 & e^{-i\Delta(x)} \end{bmatrix}. </math>This same procedure by taking a parameterization of a collection of matrices defining a Lie group and by considering the set of functions from a patch to <math>\mathbb{R}</math> and inserting them into the parameterization.  File:Z2 principal bundle over circle.png|thumb|300px|Non-trivial "Z"/2"Z" principal bundle over the circle. There is no obvious way to identify which point corresponds to "+1" or "-1" in each fibre. This bundle is non-trivial as there is no globally defined section of the projection "π". * The prototypical example of a smooth principal bundle is the frame bundle of a smooth manifold <math>M</math>, often denoted <math>FM</math> or <math>GL(M)</math>. Here the fiber over a point <math>x \in M</math> is the set of all frames (i.e. ordered bases) for the tangent space <math>T_xM</math>. The general linear group <math>GL(n,\mathbb{R})</math> acts freely and transitively on these frames. These fibers can be glued together in a natural way so as to obtain a principal <math>GL(n,\mathbb{R})</math>-bundle over <math>M</math>. * Variations on the above example include the orthonormal frame bundle of a Riemannian manifold. Here the frames are required to be orthonormal with respect to the metric tensor|metric. The structure group is the orthogonal group <math>O(n)</math>. The example also works for bundles other than the tangent bundle; if <math>E</math> is any vector bundle of rank <math>k</math> over <math>M</math>, then the bundle of frames of <math>E</math> is a principal <math>GL(k,\mathbb{R})</math>-bundle, sometimes denoted <math>F(E)</math>. * A normal (regular) covering space <math>p:C \to X</math> is a principal bundle where the structure group : <math>G = \pi_1(X)/p_{*}(\pi_1(C))</math> : acts on the fibres of <math>p</math> via the Covering space#Monodromy action|monodromy action. In particular, the universal cover of <math>X</math> is a principal bundle over <math>X</math> with structure group <math>\pi_1(X)</math> (since the universal cover is simply connected and thus <math>\pi_1(C)</math> is trivial). * Let <math>G</math> be a Lie group and let <math>H</math> be a closed subgroup (not necessarily normal subgroup|normal). Then <math>G</math> is a principal <math>H</math>-bundle over the (left) coset space <math>G/H</math>. Here the action of <math>H</math> on <math>G</math> is just right multiplication. The fibers are the left cosets of <math>H</math> (in this case there is a distinguished fiber, the one containing the identity, which is naturally isomorphic to <math>H</math>). * Consider the projection <math>\pi:S^1 \to S^1</math> given by <math>z \mapsto z^2</math>. This principal <math>\mathbb{Z}_2</math>-bundle is the associated bundle of the Möbius strip.   Besides the trivial bundle, this is the only principal <math>\mathbb{Z}_2</math>-bundle over <math>S^1</math>. * Projective spaces provide some more interesting examples of principal bundles. Recall that the <math>n</math>-sphere <math>S^n</math> is a two-fold covering space of real projective space <math>\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n</math>. The natural action of <math>O(1)</math> on <math>S^n</math> gives it the structure of a principal <math>O(1)</math>-bundle over <math>\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n</math>. Likewise, <math>S^{2n+1}</math> is a principal <math>U(1)</math>-bundle over complex projective space <math>\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n</math> and <math>S^{4n+3}</math> is a principal <math>Sp(1)</math>-bundle over quaternionic projective space <math>\mathbb{H}\mathbb{P}^n</math>. We then have a series of principal bundles for each positive <math>n</math>: : <math>\mbox{O}(1) \to S(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}) \to \mathbb{RP}^n</math> : <math>\mbox{U}(1) \to S(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}) \to \mathbb{CP}^n</math> : <math>\mbox{Sp}(1) \to S(\mathbb{H}^{n+1}) \to \mathbb{HP}^n.</math> : Here <math>S(V)</math> denotes the unit sphere in <math>V</math> (equipped with the Euclidean metric). For all of these examples the <math>n = 1</math> cases give the so-called Hopf bundles. ==Basic properties==  One of the most important questions regarding any fiber bundle is whether or not it is trivial bundle|trivial, "i.e." isomorphic to a product bundle. For principal bundles there is a convenient characterization of triviality: :"Proposition". "A principal bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global Section (fiber bundle)|section." The same is not true for other fiber bundles. For instance, vector bundles always have a zero section whether they are trivial or not and fiber bundle#Sphere bundles|sphere bundles may admit many global sections without being trivial. The same fact applies to local trivializations of principal bundles. Let  be a principal -bundle. An open set  in  admits a local trivialization if and only if there exists a local section on . Given a local trivialization :<math>\Phi : \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times G</math> one can define an associated local section  :<math>s:U \to \pi^{-1}(U);s(x) = \Phi^{-1}(x,e)\,</math> where  is the identity element|identity in . Conversely, given a section  one defines a trivialization  by :<math>\Phi^{-1}(x,g) = s(x)\cdot g.</math> The simple transitivity of the  action  on the fibers of  guarantees that this map is a bijection, it is also a homeomorphism. The local trivializations defined by local sections are -equivariant in the following sense. If we write :<math>\Phi : \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times G</math> in the form  :<math>\Phi(p) = (\pi(p), \varphi(p)),</math> then the map :<math>\varphi : P \to G</math> satisfies :<math>\varphi(p\cdot g) = \varphi(p)g.</math> Equivariant trivializations therefore preserve the -torsor structure of the fibers. In terms of the associated local section  the map  is given by :<math>\varphi(s(x)\cdot g) = g.</math> The local version of the cross section theorem then states that the equivariant local trivializations of a principal bundle are in one-to-one correspondence with local sections. Given an equivariant local trivialization  of , we have local sections  on each . On overlaps these must be related by the action of the structure group . In fact, the relationship is provided by the Transition map|transition functions :<math>t_{ij} : U_i \cap U_j \to G\,.</math> By gluing the local trivializations together using these transition functions, one may reconstruct the original principal bundle. This is an example of the fiber bundle construction theorem. For any  we have :<math>s_j(x) = s_i(x)\cdot t_{ij}(x).</math>  If <math>\pi : P \to X</math> is a smooth principal <math>G</math>-bundle then <math>G</math> acts freely and proper map|properly on <math>P</math> so that the orbit space <math>P/G</math> is diffeomorphic to the base space <math>X</math>. It turns out that these properties completely characterize smooth principal bundles. That is, if <math>P</math> is a smooth manifold, <math>G</math> a Lie group and <math>\mu : P \times G \to P</math> a smooth, free, and proper right action then *<math>P/G</math> is a smooth manifold, *the natural projection <math>\pi : P \to P/G</math> is a smooth submersion (mathematics)|submersio ...
