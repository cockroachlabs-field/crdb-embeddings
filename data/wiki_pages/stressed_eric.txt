The series revolves around Eric Feeble, a middle class man who is always Stress (medicine)|stressed because of his family, work, co-workers, etc. The show ran for 2 series in the UK, while its redubbed American version only received one series. It was heavily panned by critics and audiences for its writing, humor, characters, voice acting and its overall concept of having a well-meaning and likable main character constantly be beaten and abused by everyone around him often without any apparent reason, but was praised for its animation. ==Overview== 40-year-old Eric Feeble is still upset over his divorce two years before. He lives in a middle-class London house and is always kept under extreme amounts of pressure and stress from all aspects of life, which is represented by a throbbing vein in his temple. His two children, Brian and Claire, plague him with fear and worry daily. Claire is a frail 6-year-old who is allergic to virtually everything, including wheat, ponies, and spices; 10-year-old Brian has learning problems and has been kept back three straight years in school, and has an oral fixation and Pica (disorder)|pica. The family's au pair housekeeper, Maria, is an 18-year-old Portuguese woman with a serious drinking problem; despite Eric's frequent attempts to keep her under control and focused, she stays passed-out drunk for hours at a time. His former wife Liz left him for a Buddhist but phones him up incessantly, which merely adds to his stress level. The next-door neighbours, the wealthy, successful, snobbish Perfect family, provide him a constant and painful view of what his life could have been. Eric's workplace is absolutely no escape from his everyday problems. His boss, Paul Power (known as PP), is loud, rude and demanding; he has demoted Eric from Assistant Manager to a low-level clerk in an office sandwiched between the janitor's closet and the men's toilets. His secretary Alison is completely useless, spending all her "working hours" in personal phone calls and shrilling rudely at Eric when he requests her attention. At the end of almost every episode, as the climax of events cause Eric's stress to reach breaking point, the throbbing vein emerges from his temple and wraps itself around his neck, strangling and apparently killing him. == Characters ==  *Eric Feeble (Mark Heap) – Stressed out divorced father of two children. Eric is a kind, well-meaning man who loves his children. Although bitter and sarcastic about many aspects of his life, Eric genuinely tries to make the best out of situation and deeply loves his children, going to great lengths to make them proud. However, he normally fails due to no fault of his own, and the rare times he actually does well, something always happens to ruin it. *Claire Feeble (Morwenna Banks) – Daughter of Eric; allergic to just about everything, but an intelligent, curious, playful little girl. Her allergies require her to eat special regulation food, but she is always sneaking ordinary food which immediately swells her up. *Brian Feeble (Gábor Csupó) – Son of Eric; has been held back in school for 3 years straight. He has pica (disorder)|pica and as a result, is always putting strange things in his mouth. *Maria Gonzalez (Doon Mackichan) – The Feeble family's punk-looking live-in au pair; she is Portugal|Portuguese and always drunk or hungover. The broadcast of the series on NBC in the United States replaced Mark Heap's voice with that of Hank Azaria, whom also serves as a producer for the dub, repurposing Eric as an American expatriate.  *Liz (Rebecca Front) – Eric's eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric former wife. *Caleb (Bill Nighy) – Liz's boyfriend. *Ray Perfect (Alexander Armstrong) – Snobbish and "perfect" next-door neighbour of Eric. Shares Eric's workplace, but is senior and consistently praised for his fine work. *Sue Perfect (Alison Steadman) – Snobbish wife of Mr. Perfect. Catchphrase: "How "art" thou, Eric?" *Heather Perfect (Morwenna Banks) – Snobbish daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Perfect. *Paul Power, a.k.a. P.P. (Geoffrey McGivern) – Boss of Eric who is usually very angry. Catchphrase: "Double arseburgers, Eric!" *Alison Scabie (Doon Mackichan) – Eric's useless secretary who spends all her time on the telephone gossiping to friends. *Doc (Paul Shearer) – Eric's dementedly relaxed doctor, more interested in chasing women than treating Eric. He is the closest thing Eric has to a best friend. *Mrs. Wilson (Hayley Mills) – An old lady who slowly tries in vain to post a letter which always falls from her hand and into a drain, sometimes with Eric to blame. Catchphrase: "Morning, Mister Eric.
