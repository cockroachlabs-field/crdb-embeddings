It resulted in an estimated 120,000 fatalitiesUN Human Rights Council. 23 November 2006. "." p.18. and an exodus of almost one million people from Lebanon.Daniel Byman|Byman, Daniel, and Kenneth Michael Pollack. "Things Fall Apart: Containing the Spillover from an Iraqi Civil War." p. 139 The diversity of the Lebanese people|Lebanese population played a notable role in the lead-up to and during the conflict: Lebanese Sunni Muslims|Sunni Muslims and Christianity in Lebanon|Christians comprised the majority in the coastal cities; Shia Islam|Shia Muslims were primarily based in Southern Lebanon|the south and the Beqaa Valley in the east; and Lebanese Druze|Druze and Christians populated the country's mountainous areas. The Lebanese government had been run under the significant influence of elites within the Lebanese Maronite Christians|Maronite Christian community.Marcia C. Inhorn|Inhorn, Marcia C., and Soraya Tremayne. 2012. "Islam and Assisted Reproductive Technologies". p. 238. The link between politics and religion had been reinforced under the Mandate for Syria and Lebanon|French Mandate from 1920 to 1943, and the country's parliamentary structure favoured a leading position for Religion in Lebanon|its Christian-majority population. However, the country had a large Muslim population to match, and many Pan-Arabism|pan-Arabist and Left-wing politics|left-wing groups opposed the Christian-dominated pro-Western world|Western government. The influx of thousands of Palestinians in 1948 Palestinian exodus|1948 and 1967 Palestinian exodus|1967 contributed to the shift of Demographics of Lebanon|Lebanon's demography in favour of the Muslim population. The Cold War had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the political polarization that preceded the 1958 Lebanon crisis|1958 Lebanese crisis, since Christians sided with the Western world while leftist, Muslim, and pan-Arabist groups sided with Soviet Union|Soviet-aligned Arab world|Arab countries."Beware of Small States: Lebanon, Battleground of the Middle East." p. 62 Fighting between Maronite-Christian and Palestinian forces (mainly from the Palestine Liberation Organization) began in 1975; leftist, Muslim, and pan-Arabist Lebanese groups formed an alliance with the Palestinians in Lebanon.Halliday, 2005: 117 Over the course of the fighting, alliances shifted rapidly and unpredictably. Furthermore, foreign powers, such as Israel and Syria, became involved in the war and fought alongside different factions. Various peacekeeping forces, such as the Multinational Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, were also stationed in the country during the conflict. The Taif Agreement of 1989 marked the beginning of the end of the war. In January 1989, a committee appointed by the Arab League began to formulate solutions to the conflict. In March 1991, the Lebanese parliament passed an amnesty law that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment. In May 1991, all of the militias in Lebanon were dissolved, with the exception of Hezbollah, while the Lebanese Armed Forces began to slowly rebuild as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution. Religious tensions between Sunnis and Shias remained after the war.Rolland, John C. 2003. "Lebanon: Current Issues and Background". p. 144. . ==Background==   In 1860 a 1860 conflict in Lebanon|civil war between Druze and Maronites erupted in the Ottoman Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon, which had been divided between them in 1842. The war resulted in the massacre of about 10,000 Christians and at least 6,000 Druzes. The 1860 war was considered by the Druze as a military victory and a political defeat.
