Founded in 1847, its first classes were held on November 12, 1849. Lawrence was the second college in the U.S. to be founded as a coeducational institution. (The first was long-vanished New York Central College.) ==History== Lawrence's first president, William Harkness Sampson, founded the school with Henry R. Colman, using $10,000 provided by philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence, and matched by the Methodist church. Both founders were ordained Methodist minister of religion|ministers, but Lawrence was Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian. The school was originally named "Lawrence Institute of Wisconsin" in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, but the name was changed to Lawrence University before classes began in November 1849.See also  Charles Breunig’s book, A Great and Good Work: A History of Lawrence University, 1847–1964.  Its oldest extant building, Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall, was built in 1853.Council of Independent Colleges, "", Historic Campus Architecture Project. Lawrence University was the second coeducational institution in the country. Lawrence's first period of major growth came during the thirty-year tenure (1894―1924) of alumnus Samuel G. Plantz as president, when the student body quadrupled, from 200 to 800. From 1913 until 1964, it was named "Lawrence College", to emphasize its small size and liberal arts education focus. The name returned to Lawrence University when it merged with Milwaukee-Downer College. The state of Wisconsin then purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women. This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred "on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges" and the university by-laws still make the distinction. During World War II, Lawrence College was one of 131 colleges and universities in the nation that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission. The Lawrence Conservatory of Music, usually referred to as "the Con", was founded in 1874.  Lawrence offers three degrees: a Bachelor of Artsa Bachelor of Music and a Bachelor of Musical Arts. It also offers a five-year dual degree program, where students can receive both B.A. and B.Mus. degrees. Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two-term class, in which all students study the same selected 11 classic works of literature, art, and music, the list varying from year to year. President Nathan M. Pusey is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for implementing the program. The program continues to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1975. In 2005, LU initiated a capital campaign called "More Light!", which aimed at raising $150 million. By October 2011 the college had raised $160,272,839, with the conclusion event held on October 28, 2011. In January of 2014, LU embarked on a new capital campaign called "Be The Light!". Upon the conclusion of the campaign on December 31, 2020, more than $232,613,052 had been raised in total toward four campaign priorities: Lawrence Fund, Full Speed to Full Need, Student Journey, and Campus Renewal. Be The Light! |publisher=Bethelight.lawrence.edu |date=2020-12-31 |access-date=2021-08-18}} Lawrence University is part of the Oberlin Group, a consortium of liberal arts college libraries.  File:Main Hall at Lawrence University.jpg|thumb|Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is an Appleton landmark. The traditions and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of Crataegus|hawthorn trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the sundial on the back of Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall, to the bestowing upon each class a class color and banner. The Lawrence Dean of Women was referred to as the "Dean of Downer", but when the offices of Dean of Men and Dean of Women were merged to form the Dean of Students, the substantive duties of the "Dean of Downer" came to an end; the title is still borne by a senior female professor, but her only duty is to carry the Downer Mace in academic processions. For many years the women's choir was called the Downer Chorus.  At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of "Downer College of Lawrence University" and upon men in the name of "Lawrence College of Lawrence University"; now all B.A. degrees are conferred in the name of "Lawrence & Downer Colleges of Lawrence University." (The B.Mus. degree is from "the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music.)

Known as Freshman Studies until 2021, the program was established in 1945, and aside from a brief interruption in the mid-1970s it has remained a consistent fixture of the school's liberal arts curriculum.F. M. Doeringer, , lawrence.edu, retrieved June 28, 2022. Lawrence's First-Year Studies program focuses on a mixture of Great Books and more contemporary, influential works, which include non-fiction books, fiction books, and various other types of works, such as paintings, photographs, musical recordings, and even the periodic table of the elements. Readings are replaced every few years, with the exception of Plato's "Republic (Plato)|Republic", which has been included on the list since 1945.Ed Berthiaume, , lawrence.edu, August 5, 2020, retrieved June 28, 2022.  The Lawrence University Conservatory of Music was founded in 1874 and has been a part of Lawrence University ever since. The Conservatory offers Bachelor of Music degrees in Performance, Theory/Composition, Music Education, and a five-year double degree option that grants both a BM degree from the Conservatory and a BA degree from the College.  Approximately 25% of the Lawrence student body, or 350 students, is in the Conservatory. The Conservatory has three choirs, two bands, two jazz ensembles, a symphony orchestra, an improvisation collective, five world music ensembles, and numerous chamber music groups.  Students take about 2/3 of their classes in Music and about 1/3 in other subjects for the B.Mus., and the reverse for B.A. in Music. The Conservatory offers also a Bachelor of Musical Arts, primarily—but not exclusively—for students whose interest is in other than Western Classical Music; students take 3/4 of their classes in Music, and 1/4 in other subjects.
