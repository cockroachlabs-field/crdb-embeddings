His father, Reg Hill (footballer)|Reg Hill, was a professional footballer. His mother was a fan of Golden Age of Detective Fiction|Golden Age crime writers, and he discovered the genre while fetching her library books.John Lennard, 'Reginald Hill', in Jay Parini, ed., British Writers, Supplement IX (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004), p. 109. He passed the Eleven plus exam and attended Carlisle Grammar School where he excelled in English. After National Service in the United Kingdom|National Service (1955–57) and reading English at St Catherine's College, Oxford (1957–60), he worked as a teacher for many years, becoming a senior lecturer at Doncaster College of Education. In 1980 he retired from salaried work to devote himself full-time to writing. Hill is best known for his more than 20 novels featuring the Yorkshire detectives Andrew Dalziel, Peter Pascoe and Edgar Wield. The characters were used by the BBC in the "Dalziel and Pascoe (BBC TV series)|Dalziel and Pascoe" series, in which Dalziel was played by Warren Clarke, Pascoe by Colin Buchanan (actor)|Colin Buchanan, and Wield by David Royle. He also wrote more than 30 other novels, including five featuring Joe Sixsmith, a black machine operator turned private detective in a fictional Luton. Novels originally published under the pseudonyms of Patrick Ruell, Dick Morland, and Charles Underhill have now appeared under his own name. Hill was also a writer of short stories and ghost tales. Hill's novels employ various structural devices, such as presenting parts of the story in non-chronological order, or alternating with sections from a novel supposedly written by Peter's wife, Ellie Pascoe (née Soper). He also frequently selected one writer or one work of art to use as a central organizing element of a given novel, such as one novel being a pastiche of Jane Austen's works, or another featuring elements of classical Greek myth. The novella "One Small Step" (dedicated to "you, dear readers, without whom the writing would be in vain, and to you, still dearer purchasers, without whom the eating would be infrequent"Reginald Hill, One Small Step: A Dalziel and Pascoe Novella (London: Collins, 1990), p. 7.) is set in the future, and deals with the EuroFed Police Commissioner Pascoe and retired Dalziel investigating the first murder on the moon. The duo do not always "get their man", with at least one novel ending with the villain getting away and another strongly implying that while Dalziel and Pascoe are unable to convict anyone, a series of unrelated accidents actually included at least one unprovable instance of murder. Hill commented in 1986:<blockquote> I still recall with delight as a teen-ager making the earth-shaking discovery that many of the great "serious novelists," classical and modern, were as entertaining and interesting as the crime-writers I already loved. But it took another decade of maturation to reverse the equation and understand that many of the crime writers I had decided to grow out of were still as interesting and entertaining as the "serious novelists" I now revered.Reginald Hill, 'Looking for a Programme', in Robin Winks, ed., "Colloquium on Crime" (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1986), p. 151. </blockquote> Hill died at his home Retrieved 10/4/21. in Ravenglass, Cumbria, on 12 January 2012 after suffering a brain tumour. ==Bibliography==  #"A Clubbable Woman" (1970) #"An Advancement of Learning" (1971) #"Ruling Passion" (1973) #"An April Shroud" (1975) #"A Pinch of Snuff (novel)|A Pinch of Snuff" (1978) #"A Killing Kindness" (1980) #"Deadheads" (1983) #"Exit Lines" (1984) #"Child's Play" (1987) #Underworld (Reginald Hill novel)|"Underworld" (1988) #"Bones and Silence" (1990) #"One Small Step" (1990), novella #"Recalled to Life (novel)|Recalled to Life" (1992) #"Pictures of Perfection" (1994) #"The Wood Beyond" (1995) #"Asking for the Moon" (1996), short stories #*"The Last National Service Man" #*"Pascoe's Ghost" #*"Dalziel's Ghost" #*"One Small Step" #"On Beulah Height" (1998) #"Arms and the Women" (1999) #"Dialogues of the Dead" (2002) #"Death's Jest-Book" (2003) #"Good Morning, Midnight (Hill novel)|Good Morning, Midnight" (2004) #"The Death of Dalziel" (2007), Canada and US Title: "Death Comes for the Fat Man" #"A Cure for All Diseases" (Canada and US title: "The Price of Butcher's Meat") (2008) Shortlisted for Theakston’s Old Peculiar Crime Novel of the Year Award 2009. #"Midnight Fugue" (2009)  *"Blood Sympathy" (1993) *"Born Guilty" (1995) *"Killing the Lawyers" (1997) *"Singing the Sadness" (1999) *"The Roar of the Butterflies" (2008)  *"Fell of Dark" (1971) *"The Castle of the Demon" (1971) (As Patrick Ruell) (apa "The Turning of the Tide") *"A Fairly Dangerous Thing" (1972) *"Red Christmas" (1972) (As Patrick Ruell) *"Heart Clock" (1973) (As Dick Morland) (apa "Matlock's System" as Reginald Hill) *"Death Takes a Low Road" (1974) (As Patrick Ruell) (apa "The Low Road") *"A Very Good Hater" (1974) *"Albion!
