Arthur Rank | products =  | num_employees =  | parent =  | subsid =  }} "The Rank Organisation" was a British entertainment Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertical integration|vertically integrated film company in the United Kingdom, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996, when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured Rank Group|Rank Group plc. The company itself became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and was renamed XRO Limited in 1997. The company logo, the Gongman, first used in 1935 by the group's distribution company General Film Distributors Retrieved 2011-09-02 and seen in the opening titles of the films, became a celebrated  and enduring film emblem. ==Origin== J. Arthur Rank, born in Kingston upon Hull, UK, was already a wealthy industrialist through his father's flour Mill (grinding)|milling business, Rank Hovis McDougall|Joseph Rank Ltd, before making his start in filmmaking by financing short religious subjects in line with his Methodist beliefs. Rank was a Methodist Sunday School Teacher and wished to introduce these beliefs to a wider audience.  The Rank Organisation was founded in 1937 as a means for Rank to consolidate his filmmaking interests. ==Filmmaking  in the 1940s== A loose collective of filmmakers was established by Rank under the banner of Independent Producers Ltd., employing some of the UK's greatest directors, such as Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger ("Black Narcissus", "The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes", "I Know Where I'm Going!"), David Lean ("Brief Encounter", "Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations"), Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat ("I See a Dark Stranger", "The Blue Lagoon (1949 film)|The Blue Lagoon", "The Happiest Days of Your Life (film)|The Happiest Days of Your Life"), Ken Annakin ("Holiday Camp") and Muriel Box ("The Seventh Veil"). The Company of Youth, the Rank Organisation acting school often referred to as "The Charm School", was founded in 1945. It launched several careers including those of Donald Sinden, Dirk Bogarde, Diana Dors and Christopher Lee. Although she was not a member of the school, Petula Clark was under contract to Rank for a period of time and starred in a number of films released by the studio, including "London Town (1946 film)|London Town" (1946), one of the costliest flops in British film history. Also under contract to Rank was the Canadian actor Philip Gilbert. ==Growth== The company grew quickly, largely through acquisition. Significant developments included: * 1938 – Odeon Cinemas was purchased. * 1939 – Denham Film Studios were merged with the facilities at Pinewood Studios|Pinewood and the Amalgamated Studios in Borehamwood were acquired, but not used for making films. * 1939 – UK sites of Paramount Pictures|Paramount Cinemas purchased. * 1941 – Purchase of the Gaumont British|Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, which also owned Gainsborough Pictures, 251 cinemas and the Lime Grove Studios. * In the mid-1940s Two Cities Films became part of the Rank Organisation producing key films such as "Odd Man Out" (1947), "Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet" (1948), "Vice Versa (1948 film)|Vice Versa" (1948) and "The Rocking Horse Winner (film)|The Rocking Horse Winner" (1949). * 1946 – Bought for £1 million+ a 50 per cent share in a chain of 133 cinemas from New Zealander Robert James Kerridge, the biggest exhibition chain in Australasia; it was renamed Kerridge Odeon. * Late 1940s – A majority shareholding in Allied Cinemas and Irish Cinemas Ltd was gained, becoming the largest exhibition circuit in Ireland (a position maintained until the early 1980s). By the late 1940s J. Arthur Rank (or the Rank Organisation as it was now called), owned: * Five major film studio complexes, Pinewood Studios|Pinewood Film Studios, Denham Film Studios, Ealing Studios, Lime Grove Studios and Gainsborough Pictures|Islington Studios (the studios at Lime Grove were sold to the BBC Television|BBC in 1949). * 650 UK cinemas (Gaumont-British|Gaumont, Odeon Cinemas|Odeon and Paramount Pictures|Paramount chains) plus various international holdings, including subsidiaries in Canada and The Netherlands. * General Film Distributors (later Rank Film Distributors), including the UK distribution rights to Universal Pictures. * Rank Screen Advertising. * Rank Film Laboratories, Denham (later rebranded DeLuxe London after Rank's acquisition of DeLuxe Laboratories from 20th Century Fox in 1990). ==Crisis and diversification== Despite funding films which were both popular and critically acclaimed, Rank was in crisis by 1949, having built up a debt of £16 million,Patricia Warren "British Film Studios: An Illustrated History", London: B. T. Batsford, 2001, p.120 and reported an annual loss of £3.5 million. Managing Director John Davis (British businessman)|John Davis cut staff, reduced budgets and concentrated film production at Pinewood. Other studio facilities (in Gainsborough Pictures|Islington) were closed, sold (Lime Grove Studios) or leased (Denham). The Rank Organisation closed Independent Producers Ltd. The policies of Davis alienated many in the industry; in particular they led film director David Lean, responsible for some of Rank's most critically and financially successful films, to look elsewhere for backing.Brian McFarlane , BFI screenonline; McFarlane (ed.) "Encyclopedia of British Film", London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.164 J. Arthur Rank stepped down as managing director of the Rank Organisation in 1952, but remained as chairman until 1962. In October 1955 the company reported its film production was "satifactory". ==Diversification== In 1949, the company bought the Bush (company)|Bush Radio manufacturing facility and began to diversify its interests. In the early 1960s Rank took over Murphy Radio to form the "Rank Bush Murphy Group" (which was eventually sold to Great Universal Stores in 1978). In 1956 Rank began a partnership with the Haloid Corporation to form Rank Xerox, to manufacture and promote its range of plain paper photocopying equipment. In later years, the waning film company assets were hastily converted and pressed into 'Rank Xerox' service. This venture was a huge gamble but ultimately the company's saving grace, until, once more in financial difficulties, it signed off increasing percentages of its holdings, to the parent company, finally becoming fully integrated into Xerox in the late 1990s.John Clement , "The Independent", 1 July 1993 Rank was also a significant shareholder in the consortium which became Southern Television, the first ITV (TV network)|ITV television contract holder for the south of England. In the late 1950s, Rank set up "Rank Records Ltd." (the record label was named "Top Rank") and "Jaro Records" (a US subsidiary). In 1960, Top Rank was taken over by EMI, and in 1962 they replaced it with Stateside Records. Top Rank artists included Gary U.S. Bonds, the Shirelles, B. Bumble and the Stingers, Wilbert Harrison, Skip & Flip, Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart, Craig Douglas and John Leyton. A US branch of Top Rank operated from 1959 to 1961; its artists included Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott, Dorothy Collins, and The Fireballs. "Rank Audio Visual" was created in 1960, bringing together Rank's acquisitions in multimedia, including Bell & Howell (acquired with Gaumont British in 1941), Andrew Smith Harkness Ltd (1952) and Wharfedale (company)|Wharfedale Ltd (1958). Subsequent acquisitions included Strand Lighting|Strand Electric Holdings (1968) and LEAK|H.J. Leak & Co. (1969). In the mid and late 1970s, Rank Audio Visual made a 3-in-1 stereo music centre, as well as TV sets in conjunction with NEC of Japan. The production of the "classic" Rank TV ran in the mid to late 70s, some interim models appeared and the "modern" Rank TV appeared in the early 1980s. The NEC badge did not appear in the PAL/220/240 volt countries until the mid-1980s. "Top Rank" was one of the early operators of motorway service areas in the UK, opening its first services at Medway services|Farthing Corner on the M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 in Kent in 1963. Top Rank operated a portfolio of 10 service areas until the takeover of Mecca Leisure Group by the Rank Group in 1991, when they were spun off to ex-Mecca CEO Michael Guthrie under the name Pavilion (later acquired by Granada plc|Granada and now forming part of Moto Hospitality). There were other small specialised groups, including Rank Taylor Hobson who made inspection equipment, Rank Cintel who made telecine (television film scanners) machines, and Gaumont Kalee who made audio analysis equipment. ==Declining involvement in the film industry== During this period, Rank started focussing on primarily solidly commercial ventures, largely aimed at the family market. These include the popular Norman Wisdom comedies, the Doctor (film series)|Doctor films series and, later, Rank took on  the Carry On (film series)|Carry On film series from Anglo-Amalgamated. Films of note were produced during this era including "Carve Her Name with Pride", "Sapphire (film)|Sapphire", "A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember" and "Victim (1961 film)|Victim", as well as a clutch of prestige topics such as the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and filmed performances by the Royal Ballet.  In February 1956 Davis announced Rank would make 20 films at over £3 million. He said "great care will be taken to ensure that, while retaining essentially British characteristics the films will have the widest international appeal. This is part of an intensified drive to secure ever widening showing in overseas markets which already return more than half the revenue earned by Pinewood films." That year, Rank announced it would set up distribution in the US. In October Davis listed the Rank actors he thought could become international stars: Dirk Bogarde, Peter Finch, Kay Kendall, Jeannie Carson, Virginia McKenna, Belinda Lee, Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig, Tony Wright (actor)|Tony Wright, Maureen Swanson and Kenneth More. In October 1957, at the 21st birthday for Pinewood Studios, Davis said Rank would make 18 films this year and 20 the next, with the latter costing £5 million. However cinema attedances fell. In September 1958 the company had lost £1,264,000 on films causing the group's profit to drop from £5 million to £1.8 million. John Davis wound up several long term contracts Rank had with talent. "The trouble with some of them is they won't work," he said. "They lose their sense of proportion." In the late 1950s Sydney Box became head of production although he retired from the industry in 1959. In January 1960, John Davis announced that Rank would concentrate on bigger budgeted, internationally focused productions.  In 1961 they announced a production slate of a dozen films worth £7 million. In October 1962 Lord Rank resigned as chairman of the company and was replaced by managing director Davis. That year to company made a group profit of over £6 million and stated 41% of its film production income came from overseas.{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/825592890/?terms=%22john%20davis%22%20%22rank%20film%22&match=1|title=Ad ...
