The yellow-headed day gecko feeds on insects and nectar. ==Etymology== The Specific name (zoology)|specific name, "klemmeri", is in honor of German Herpetology|herpetologist :de:Konrad Klemmer|Konrad Klemmer.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). "The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles". Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . ("Phelsuma klemmeri", p. 143). ==Description== "P. klemmeri" <!-- belongs to the smallest subfamily of day geckos (?? Doesn't it belong to the large subfamily Gekkoninae? Or are any subfamilies of the family Gekkonidae still recognized? --> are very small, reaching a total length (including tail) of 3.25-3.75″ (8.3-9.5cm). The body colour of this slender and long-snouted gecko is turquoise blue at the upper and mid-back. The lower back is light brown. Most of the tail is turquoise blue. Remarkable is the laterally flattened body. Another typical characteristic is the yellow head. A dark black spot is present behind the eye, followed by a black stripe which extends to the rear extremities. The legs and toes are brown speckled. The ventral side is grayish white. The sexes can easily be distinguished by the orange color around the femoral pores of the males. ==Geographic range== "P. klemmeri" inhabits northwest Madagascar, along the coast. It is only known from the Ampasindava Peninsula (at Antsatsaka) and near Mandrozo Lake. ==Habitat== File: Gekkonidae - Phelsuma klemmeri.JPG|thumb|250px|left|"Phelsuma klemmeri" "P. klemmeri" typically lives in bamboo forests. It sometimes shares its habitat with "Phelsuma seippi" and "Phelsuma madagascariensis grandis". "P. klemmeri" is most commonly found on yellow bamboo canes, but may be found on green bamboo or other nearby foliage. When threatened, "P. klemmeri" will hide inside narrow cracks in the bamboo. ==Diet== "P. klemmeri" feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar. ==Behaviour== "P. klemmeri" is primarily active during the day (diurnal) and likes to bask. It often lives in small groups. ==Reproduction== The female "P. klemmeri" lays a pair of eggs and hides them in bamboo canes. At a temperature of 27&nbsp;°C (80.6&nbsp;°F), the young will hatch after approximately 39–52 days. Each juvenile measures . ==Captivity== The species "P. klemmeri" is bred extensively in captivity, and the IUCN thinks it unlikely that it is still wild-caught. When well cared-for, this species may live for up to 15 years. == References ==    ==Further reading== *Frank Glaw|Glaw F, Miguel Vences|Vences M (1994).
