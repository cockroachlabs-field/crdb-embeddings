Die Wahlvorgänge in den Staaten des Deutschen Bundes im Spiegel zeitgenössischer Quellen". Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1985,  elected on 1 May 1848 (see German federal election, 1848). The session was held from 18 May 1848 to 31 May 1849, in the St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|Paulskirche at Frankfurt am Main. Its existence was both part of and the result of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|"March Revolution" within the states of the German Confederation. After long and controversial debates, the assembly produced the so-called Frankfurt Constitution ("Paulskirchenverfassung" or St. Paul's Church Constitution, officially the "Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches") which proclaimed a German Empire (1848/1849)|German Empire based on the principles of parliamentary democracy. This constitution fulfilled the main demands of the liberal and nation-state|nationalist social movement|movements of the Vormärz and provided a foundation of basic rights, both of which stood in opposition (politics)|opposition to Metternich's Carlsbad Decrees|system of European Restoration|Restoration. The parliament also proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by a hereditary monarchy|hereditary emperor ("Kaiser"). The Prussian king Frederick William IV refused to accept the office of emperor when it was offered to him on the grounds that such a constitution and such an offer were an abridgment of the rights of the princes of the individual German states. In the 20th century, however, major elements of the Frankfurt constitution became models for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949. == Background ==  File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|300px|Political map of the German Confederation (1815–1866) with its 39 member states In 1806, the Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II had relinquished the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire and dissolved the Empire. This was the result of the Napoleonic Wars and of direct military pressure from Napoléon Bonaparte. After the victory of Prussia, the United Kingdom, Russian Empire|Russia and other states over Napoléon in 1815, the Vienna Congress created the German Confederation ("Deutscher Bund"). Austrian Empire|Austria dominated this system of loosely connected, independent states, but the system failed to account for the rising influence of Prussia.  After the so-called "Wars of Liberation" ("Befreiungskriege", the German term for the German War of Liberation|German part of the War of the Sixth Coalition), many contemporaries had expected a nation-state solution and thus considered the subdivision of Germany as unsatisfactory. Apart from this nationalist component, calls for civic rights influenced political discourse. The Napoleonic "Code Civil" had led to the introduction of civic rights in some German states in the early 19th century. Furthermore, some German states had adopted constitutions after the foundation of the German Confederacy. Between 1819 and 1830, the Carlsbad Decrees and other instances of European Restoration|Restoration politics limited such developments. The unrest that resulted from the 1830 French July Revolution led to a temporary reversal of that trend, but after the demonstration for civic rights and national unity at the 1832 Hambach Festival, and the abortive attempt at an armed rising in the 1833 "Frankfurter Wachensturm", the pressure on representatives of constitutional or democratic ideas was raised through measures such as censorship and bans on public assemblies.   The 1840s began with the Rhine crisis|Rhine Crisis, a primarily diplomatic scandal caused by the threat from the French prime minister Adolphe Thiers to invade Germany in a dispute between Paris and the four other Great Powers (including Austria and Prussia) over the Middle East. The threat alarmed the German Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Confederate Diet ("Bundesversammlung"), which was made up of representatives of the individual princes, and the only institution representing the whole German Confederation. The Diet voted to extend the Fortresses of the German Confederation ("Bundesfestungen") at Mainz, Ulm, and Rastatt, while the Kingdom of Bavaria developed the fortress at Germersheim. Patriotic feelings of the public were effectively captured in the poem "Die Wacht am Rhein" ("Watch on the Rhine") by Max Schneckenburger, and in songs such as "Der Deutsche Rhein" and the "Deutschlandlied|Lied der Deutschen", the national anthem of Germany since 1922. The mid-1840s saw an increased frequency of internal crises. This was partially the result of large-scale political developments, such as the escalation of the Schleswig-Holstein Question|future of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein and the erection of the "Bundesfestungen". Additionally, a series of bad harvests in parts of Germany, notably the southwest, led to widely spread famine-related unrest in 1845 and 1846. The changes caused by the beginnings of Industrial Revolution|industrialisation exacerbated social and economic tensions considerably, especially in Saxony and Silesia. Meanwhile, in the reform-oriented states, such as Baden, the development of a lively scene of "Vereine" (Club (organization)|clubs or voluntary associations) provided an organizational framework for democratic, or popular, opposition. Especially in south west Germany, censorship could not effectively suppress the press.  At such rallies as the Offenburg Popular Assembly of September 1847, radical democrats called to overthrow the "status quo". At the same time, the "bourgeois" (here used to describe the Middle Class) opposition had increased its networking activities and began coordinating its activities in the individual Bicameralism|chamber parliaments more and more confidently. Thus, at the Heppenheim Conference on 10 October 1847, eighteen liberal members from a variety of German states met to discuss common motions for a German nation-state.Bascom Barry Hayes, "Bismarck and Mitteleuropa". Fairleigh Dickinson Univ. Press, 1994, page 67. In Prussia, King Frederick William IV finally approved the assembly of a "United Diet" promised by his father in the decree of 22 May 1815. This body was commanded to debate and vote only on taxes and loans. However, as soon as it opened in April 1847, its members began discussions of press freedoms, voting and human rights, the power to introduce legislation, and foreign policy. After eleven weeks, the United Diet rejected a loan request. The King closed the diet in disgust and refused to say when it would be reopened. However, the people's enthusiasm for the United Diet was undeniable, and it was clear that a new political age was dawning. Many of the most eloquent members of the United Diet would play important roles in the future Frankfurt Parliament.Treitschke, Heinrich, "History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century". Jarrold & Sons, London, trans. 1919. Vol. VII, pp. 400–473. Between 1846 and 1848, broader Revolutions of 1848|European developments aggravated this tension. The Galician slaughter|Peasant Uprising in Galicia in February and March 1846 was a revolt against serfdom, directed against manorial property and oppression. Rioting Galician peasants killed some 1,000 noblemen and destroyed about 500 manors. Despite its failure, the uprising was seen by some scholars, including Karl Marx, as a "deeply democratic movement that aimed at land reform and other pressing social questions." The uprising was praised by Marx and Friedrich Engels for being "the first in Europe to plant the banner of social revolution", and seen as a precursor to the coming Spring of Nations. At the same time, the suppression of the Free City of Cracow in the midst of the uprising aroused the emotions of nationalists in Germany as much as in Poland. In Switzerland, the Sonderbund War of November 1847 saw the swift defeat of the conservative Catholic cantons and victory for the radical left wing in the Protestant cantons. Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich had pondered military intervention and later regretted not doing so, blaming the resulting waves of revolution on the Swiss. Three months later, revolutionary workers and students in France deposed the "Citizen King" Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe in the French Revolution of 1848|February Revolution; their action resulted in the declaration of the French Second Republic|Second Republic. In many European states, the resistance against Restoration policies increased and led to revolutionary unrest. In several parts of the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Austrian Empire, namely in Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary, Bohemia, Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Romania, and throughout Italy, in particular in Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848|Sicily, Roman Republic (19th century)|Rome, and Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Northern Italy, there were bloody revolts, replete with calls for local or regional autonomy and even for national independence. Friedrich Daniel Bassermann, a liberal deputy in the second chamber of the parliament of Baden, helped to trigger the final impulse for the election of a pan-German assembly (or parliament). On 12 February 1848, referring to his own motion ("Motion Bassermann") in 1844 and a comparable one by Carl Theodor Welcker in 1831, he called for a representation, elected by the people, in the Confederate Diet. Two weeks later, news of the successful coup in France fanned the flames of the revolutionary mood. The revolution on German soil began in Baden, with the occupation of the "Ständehaus" at Karlsruhe. This was followed in April by the "Heckerzug" (named after its leader, Friedrich Hecker), the first of three revolutionary risings in the Grand Duchy. Within a few days and weeks, the revolts spread to the other German Principality|principalities.   File:1848_politische_versammlung_in_berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Political assembly, Berlin, 1848Th ...
