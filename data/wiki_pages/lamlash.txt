It lies  south of the island's main settlement and ferry port Brodick, in a sheltered bay on the island's east coast, facing the Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle. Lamlash is the seat of Arran's local government offices, and is also the location of the island's police station, Arran High School|secondary school and Arran War Memorial Hospital|hospital. In common with the rest of the island, the village's main industry is tourism and the public sector is also an important employer. Lamlash has an RNLI Lifeboat station with a B class Atlantic 75 class lifeboat|Atlantic 75 lifeboat, covering the inshore waters around the coast of Arran, and in summer, there is a regular ferry service from Lamlash harbour to Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle. The village has several buildings of historical interest, including Hamilton Terrace, which consists of two rows of single storey-and-attic cottages on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs. == History == A prehistoric ring of stones indicates that an ancient settlement has existed near Lamlash since antiquity. The name "Lamlash" dates back to the 6th Century hermitage of Molaise of Leighlin|Saint Molaise, a Celtic monk born in Ireland but raised in Scotland, who, circa 590, spent some time in a cave on the neighbouring Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle. Commonly known as "MoLaise" the Gaelic name of Holy Isle was, as a result, "Eilean MoLaise". This gradually evolved through "Elmolaise" and "Lemolash" to Lamlash, which is what Holy Isle was called until early in the 19th century. After that time the name was more normally attached to the village that grew up facing it. Lamlash was peripherally involved in the 13th century Battle of Largs. It was the birthplace of artist James Kay (artist)|James Kay. When Mary, Queen of Scots was at Dumbarton Castle in February 1548 during the war of the Rough Wooing, the English commander William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton|Grey of Wilton proposed basing some warships at "Lammelashe" to watch for French ships.Joseph Bain, "Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563", vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pg. 586. The village was the training place for No. 11 (Scottish) Commando during the early years of the World War II|Second World War. == Geography == Lamlash is located in the southern half of the island, some  to the south of Brodick and  to the north of Whiting Bay. It is on the eastern side and sits on a bay facing the Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle and the Firth of Clyde. == Layout and notable sights ==  File:Scotland, Isle of Arran, Lamlash, the seafront .JPG|thumb|left|240px|"An elongated settlement character" The basic character of the village is formed by a long building line of two and three-storey roughcast or stone houses lining the inland side of the shore road. The parish church and the former St George's church sit at either end of this series of buildings. Only the scattered buildings around the pierhead break this pattern. This elongated settlement character was already well established in the 19th century. The creation of Hamilton Terrace and its shorefront public space added to the image of Lamlash as it looks today. Lamlash has several characteristic buildings, some of them listed for their special architectural or historical interest. These include:  Hamilton Terrace consists of two rows of single storey-and-attic cottages of which numbers 1–27 are on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs. Numbers 1a–24a are positioned behind these and are probably coeval with numbers 1–27 and assumed to have been built for residents' summer occupation allowing the main houses to be let to visitors, an accepted practice in Arran. The terrace is a major architectural feature of the village, designed by Sir John James Burnet and constructed in the late 19th century. The houses have survived with a minimum of changes, even to their rear elevation. Some still have original glazing. One of the houses functions as the Lamlash Post Office at no 27. On the front side (seaside) the complex had two rectangular garden enclosures; one of these is currently a car park. On the lawn between the enclosures is a modern monument in remembrance of the Arran clearance emigrants in the form of 3 standing stones.  File:Scotland, Isle of Arran, Lamlash, St. Georges church (1).JPG|thumb|177px|St George's United Free Church St George's United Free Church stands on the northern end of Lamlash, on Bungalow Road in the Margnaheglish neighbourhood. The church was erected between 1885-1892 in early English style by the Duke of Hamilton to replace an older church from 1774. It is built in cream-coloured sandstone and has a square stone pyramidal spire with an iron weathervane.  The church was used by the Lamlash Free Church congregation from 1892 until the union of the Free and United Presbyterian Churches in 1900, when it became the United Free Church. From 1929 it formed one of the congregations of Lamlash Parish church at that year's union with the Church of Scotland. The church was in use until 1947 and stands empty since. As of 2015, the building was undergoing renovation. The Arran Theatre and Arts Trust, established in 1989 had as its main objective to convert St George's Church into a theatre. As part of that objective, the Trust ran many events and brought touring companies to Arran, but because of "wider political issues" the plan never materialized. Similarly, plans to turn it into a Childhood Heritage Museum also failed in 1999. In the meantime the Scottish Civic Trust added the church to the register of "Buildings at Risk" in 1993.  A chance to save the building arose in October 2004 when CRGP Architects & Surveyors from Glasgow applied for permission for the conversion of the church to form 8 flats and the erection of an extension to the rear to form 6 flats with associated parking. The application was granted on 7 February 2005 by the North Ayrshire Council, subject to a number of conditions. However, the development was not realized. Then, in February 2007, the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the Church. In its report, ARPL considered the state of the church poor but saveable. It recommended that -as a category B listed building- the retention of this historic structure is of importance. ARPL suggested to convert the church into three apartments and to build some new development to the rear to make it financially viable (just as CRGP Architects had requested 3 years earlier), and advised the Council to encourage the owner to progress the development to ensure the building did not decline to the point where demolition is required. Again, nothing happened and, as of 2010, the building stands neglected. Minutes from the Arran Community Council show that the future of the church is a regular topic of debate, but difficulty in contacting the private owner or convincing him to cooperate seem to be (part of) the reason that there has been no progress to date. The church's former manse (next door) is also a category B listed building. It was built in 1898 and remained in use as manse for the united congregation until circa 1990. Lamlash and Kilbride Parish Church and the church hall. It is a T-plan, aisleless, Gothic-style church built in 1886 by architect Hugh Barclay in red sandstone with a massive campanile-like tower. The church is prominently situated on the Shore Road and is  ...
