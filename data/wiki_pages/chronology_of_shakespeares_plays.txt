   File:Malone Attempt title page, cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Edmond Malone was the first scholar to construct a tentative chronology of Shakespeare's plays in "An Attempt to Ascertain the Order in Which the Plays attributed to Shakspeare were Written" (1778), an essay published in the second edition of Samuel Johnson and George Steevens' "The Plays of William Shakespeare". This article presents a possible ""chronological listing of the composition of the Shakespeare's plays|plays of William Shakespeare"". Shakespearean scholars, beginning with Edmond Malone in 1778, have attempted to reconstruct the relative chronology of Shakespeare's "oeuvre" by various means, using external evidence (such as references to the plays by Shakespeare's contemporaries in both critical material and private documents, allusions in other plays, entries in the Stationers' Register, and records of performance and publication), and internal evidence (allusions within the plays to contemporary events, composition and publication dates of sources used by Shakespeare, stylistic analysis looking at the development of his style and diction over time, and the plays' context in the contemporary theatrical and literary "milieu"). Most modern chronologies are based on the work of E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers in "The Problem of Chronology" (1930), published in Volume 1 of his book "William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems". == Introduction == Since the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, nor can there be, a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first "recorded" performances of many plays were not necessarily when the plays were first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of "Romeo and Juliet" was not until 1662, yet it is known the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime. At best, the performance history of a play establishes only the "terminus ante quem" of its composition. Similarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the "First Folio" (1623), prepared by John Heminges and Henry Condell, and published by Edward Blount, William Jaggard and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, "Titus Andronicus" was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594; "Othello" was performed in 1604, but not published until 1622; and "King Lear" was performed in 1606, but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining much more speculative. In addition, some scholars dissent from the conventional dating system altogether. A notable scholar who does so is E. A. J. Honigmann, who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career by four or five years, to the mid-1580s, with his "early start" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with "Titus Andronicus" in 1586, though the conventional dating is that Shakespeare began writing plays after arriving in London in about 1590. Most scholars, however, adhere to a more orthodox chronology, and some, such as Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor and Sidney Thomas, argue that the early start theory causes more problems than it solves.  == Scholarship ==  The chronology presented by E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers in 1930 is as follows:  * "Henry VI, Part 2" (1590–1591) * "Henry VI, Part 3" (1590–1591) * "Henry VI, Part 1" (1591–1592) * "Richard III (play)|Richard III" (1592–1593) * "The Comedy of Errors" (1592–1593) * "Titus Andronicus" (1593–1594) * "The Taming of the Shrew" (1593–1594) * "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" (1594–1595) * "Love's Labour's Lost" (1594–1595) * "Romeo and Juliet" (1594–1595) * "Richard II (play)|Richard II" (1595–1596) * "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (1595–1596) * "King John (play)|King John" (1596–1597) * "The Merchant of Venice" (1596–1597) * "Henry IV, Part 1" (1597–1598) * "Henry IV, Part 2" (1597–1598) * "Much Ado About Nothing" (1598–1599) * "Henry V (play)|Henry V" (1598–1599) * "Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar" (1599–1600) * "As You Like It" (1599–1600) * "Twelfth Night" (1599–1600) * "Hamlet" (1600–1601) * "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (1600–1601) * "Troilus and Cressida" (1601–1602) * "All's Well That Ends Well" (1602–1603) * "Measure for Measure" (1604–1605) * "Othello" (1604–1605) * "King Lear" (1605–1606) * "Macbeth" (1605–1606) * "Antony and Cleopatra" (1606–1607) * "Coriolanus" (1607–1608) * "Timon of Athens" (1607–1608) * "Pericles, Prince of Tyre" (1608–1609) * "Cymbeline" (1609–1610) * "The Winter's Tale" (1610–1611) * "The Tempest" (1611–1612) * "Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII" (1612–1613) * "The Two Noble Kinsmen" (1612–1613)   There are six major modern scholarly editions of the "Complete Works of Shakespeare": * "The Riverside Shakespeare" (edited by G. Blakemore Evans in 1974, with a second edition in 1996) * "The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works" (edited by Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor, John Jowett and William Montgomery (English literature scholar)|William Montgomery in 1986, with a second edition in 2005) * "The W. W. Norton & Company|Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition" (edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E. Howard and Katharine Eisaman Maus in 1997, with a second edition in 2008 and a third in 2015) * "Arden Shakespeare|The Arden Shakespeare: Complete Works" (edited by Richard Proudfoot, Ann Thompson (scholar)|Ann Thompson and David Scott Kastan in 1998, with a second edition in 2002 and a third in 2011) * "The Complete Pelican Books|Pelican Shakespeare" (edited by Stephen Orgel and A. R. Braunmuller in 2002), and * "Royal Shakespeare Company|The RSC Shakespeare: Complete Works" (edited by Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen (scholar)|Eric Rasmussen in 2007). Additionally, as with Oxford, Arden, Pelican and the RSC, the New Cambridge Shakespeare, the New Penguin Books|Penguin Shakespeare, the New American Library|Signet Classic Shakespeare, the J. Dover Wilson|Dover Wilson Shakespeare, the Shakespeare Folios and the Folger Shakespeare Library all publish scholarly editions of individual plays, although none has issued a complete works. "The Arden Shakespeare" presents the plays in alphabetical order of their titles, without any attempt to construct an overall chronology. The Oxford, Riverside, Norton and RSC collections each rely on chronologies that differ from one another and attempt only approximate dating. The following list is based on "The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works"  (2nd ed.) and the accompanying "William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion" (Revised ed.), edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. == Chronology ==  File:Palladis Tamia, Wits Treasury Francis Meres Love labours won excerpt 1598.jpg|thumb|upright|Extract from Francis Meres' "Palladis Tamia" (1598), which makes reference to twelve of Shakespeare's plays. :""First official record"": in Francis Meres' "Palladis Tamia" (1598), referred to as ""Gentlemen of Verona"." :""First published"": "First Folio" (1623). :""First recorded performance"": an adaptation by Benjamin Victor (theatre manager)|Benjamin Victor was performed at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane in 1762. The earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Royal Opera House|Covent Garden on 15 April 1784, although because of the reference to the play in "Palladis Tamia", we know it was definitely performed in Shakespeare's lifetime. :""Evidence"": Stanley Wells argues that the play's "dramatic structure is comparatively unambitious, and while some of its scenes are expertly constructed, those involving more than, at the most, four characters betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience." The play is therefore considered one of the first Shakespeare composed after his arrival in London "c."1590, at which point he would have lacked theatrical experience. Furthermore, the discussion between Launce and Speed regarding the vices and virtues of Launce's mistress (3.1.276–359For each play, line references, and occasionally even scene numbers and divisions, can differ substantially from edition to edition. In order to maintain a degree of continuity, all line references throughout this article are to the individual Oxford Shakespeare editions, unless otherwise noted.) seems to borrow from John Lyly's "Midas (Lyly play)|Midas", which was written in late 1588 and/or early 1589, thus fixing a "terminus post quem" for the play. This situates the date of composition as somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known Shakespeare was working on the "Henry VI" plays. In his 2008 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests Shakespeare may have written the play prior to his arrival in London, possibly as early as 1587, although he acknowledges this theory is purely speculative.
