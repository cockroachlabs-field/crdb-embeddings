 In mathematics, the "Hodge star operator" or "Hodge star" is a linear map defined on the exterior algebra of a Dimension (vector space)|finite-dimensional orientation (mathematics)|oriented vector space endowed with a Degenerate bilinear form|nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.  Applying the operator to an element of the algebra produces the "Hodge dual" of the element.  This map was introduced by W. V. D. Hodge. For example, in an oriented 3-dimensional Euclidean space, an oriented plane can be represented by the exterior product of two basis vectors, and its Hodge dual is the normal vector given by their cross product; conversely, any vector is dual to the oriented plane perpendicular to it, endowed with a suitable bivector. Generalizing this to an -dimensional vector space, the Hodge star is a one-to-one mapping of -vectors to -vectors; the dimensions of these spaces are the binomial coefficients <math>\tbinom nk = \tbinom{n}{n - k}</math>. The Natural transformation|naturalness of the star operator means it can play a role in differential geometry, when applied to the cotangent Vector bundle|bundle of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and hence to  Differential form|differential -forms. This allows the definition of the codifferential as the Hodge adjoint of the exterior derivative, leading to the Laplace–Beltrami operator#Laplace–de Rham operator|Laplace–de Rham operator. This generalizes the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, in which divergence of a vector field may be realized as the codifferential opposite to the gradient operator, and the Laplace operator on a function is the divergence of its gradient. An important application is the Hodge decomposition of differential forms on a Closed manifold|closed Riemannian manifold. ==Formal definition for "k"-vectors== Let  be an Dimension (vector space)|-dimensional orientation (mathematics)|oriented vector space with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form <math>\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle</math>, referred to here as an inner product. This induces an Exterior algebra#Inner product|inner product on Multivector|"k"-vectors  for <math>0 \le k \le n</math>, by defining it on decomposable -vectors <math>\alpha = \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha_k</math> and <math>\beta = \beta_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \beta_k</math> to equal the Gram determinantHarley Flanders (1963) "Differential Forms with Applications to the Physical Sciences", Academic Press :<math> \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle = \det \left( \left\langle \alpha_i, \beta_j \right\rangle  _{i,j=1}^k\right)</math> extended to <math display="inline">\bigwedge^{\!k}V</math> through linearity. The unit -vector <math>\omega\in{\textstyle\bigwedge}^{\!n}V</math> is defined in terms of an oriented orthonormal basis <math>\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}</math> of  as: :<math>\omega := e_1\wedge\cdots\wedge e_n.</math> The "Hodge star operator" is a linear operator on the exterior algebra of , mapping -vectors to ()-vectors, for <math>0 \le k \le n</math>. It has the following property, which defines it completely: :<math>\alpha \wedge ({\star} \beta) = \langle \alpha,\beta \rangle \,\omega </math> for every pair of -vectors <math>\alpha,\beta\in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{\!k}V .</math> Dually, in the space <math>{\textstyle\bigwedge}^{\!n}V^*</math>of -forms (alternating -multilinear functions on <math>V^n</math>), the dual to <math>\omega</math> is the  volume form <math>\det</math>, the function whose value on <math>v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_n</math> is the determinant of the <math>n\times n</math> matrix assembled from the column vectors of <math>v_i</math> in <math>e_i</math>-coordinates. Applying <math>\det</math> to the above equation, we obtain the dual definition: :<math>\det(\alpha \wedge {\star} \beta) = \langle \alpha,\beta \rangle .</math> or equivalently, taking <math>\alpha = \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha_k</math>,  <math>\beta = \beta_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \beta_k</math>,  and <math>\star\beta = \beta_1^\star \wedge \cdots \wedge \beta_{n-k}^\star</math>: :<math>   \det\left(\alpha_1\wedge \cdots \wedge\alpha_k\wedge\beta_1^\star\wedge \cdots \wedge\beta_{n-k}^\star\right)   \ = \ \det\left(\langle\alpha_i, \beta_j\rangle\right). </math> This means that, writing an orthonormal basis of -vectors as <math>e_I \ = \ e_{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_k}</math> over all subsets <math>I = \{i_1<\cdots<i_k\}</math> of <math>=\{1,\ldots,n\}</math>, the Hodge dual is the ()-vector corresponding to the complementary set <math>\bar{I} = \setminus I = \left\{\bar i_1 < \cdots < \bar i_{n-k}\right\}</math>: :<math>{\star} e_I = (-1)^{\sigma(I)} e_\bar{I} ,</math> where <math>(-1)^{\sigma(I)}</math> is the Parity of a permutation|sign of the permutation <math>\sigma(I) = i_1 \cdots i_k \bar i_1 \cdots \bar i_{n-k}</math>. Since Hodge star takes an orthonormal basis to an orthonormal basis, it is an isometry on the exterior algebra <math display="inline">\bigwedge V</math>. == Geometric explanation == The Hodge star is motivated by the correspondence between a subspace  of  and its orthogonal subspace (with respect to the inner product), where each space is endowed with an Orientation (vector space)|orientation and a numerical scaling factor. Specifically, a non-zero decomposable -vector <math>w_1\wedge\cdots\wedge w_k\in \textstyle\bigwedge^{\!k} V</math> corresponds by the Plücker embedding to the subspace <math>W</math> with oriented basis <math>w_1,\ldots,w_k</math>, endowed with a scaling factor equal to the -dimensional volume of the parallelepiped spanned by this basis (equal to the Gramian matrix|Gramian, the determinant of the matrix of inner products <math>\langle w_i, w_j \rangle</math>). The Hodge star acting on a decomposable vector can be written as a decomposable ()-vector: :<math>\star(w_1\wedge\cdots\wedge w_k) \,=\, u_1\wedge\cdots\wedge u_{n-k},</math> where <math>u_1,\ldots,u_{n-k}</math> form an oriented basis of the Orthogonality|orthogonal space <math>U = W^\perp\!</math>. Furthermore, the ()-volume of the <math>u_i</math>-parallelepiped must equal the -volume of the <math>w_i</math>-parallelepiped, and <math>w_1,\ldots,w_k,u_1,\ldots,u_{n-k}</math> must form an oriented basis of . A general -vector is a linear combination of decomposable -vectors, and the definition of the Hodge star is extended to general -vectors by defining it as being linear. ==Examples==  In two dimensions with the normalized Euclidean metric and orientation given by the ordering , the Hodge star on -forms is given by <math display="block">\begin{align}               {\star} \, 1 &= dx \wedge dy \\              {\star} \, dx &= dy \\              {\star} \, dy &= -dx \\   {\star} ( dx \wedge dy ) &= 1 . \end{align}</math> On the complex plane regarded as a real vector space with the standard sesquilinear form as the metric, the Hodge star has the remarkable property that it is invariant under holomorphic changes of coordinate. If  is a holomorphic function of , then by the Cauchy–Riemann equations we have that  = }} and  = −}}. In the new coordinates <math display="block"> \alpha \ =\ p \,dx + q \,dy \ =\ \left( p \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \right) \,du + \left( p \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \right) \,dv  \ =\  p_1 du + q_1 \, dv ,</math> so that <math display="block">\begin{align}   {\star}\alpha     &= -q_1 \,du + p_1 \,dv \\     &= - \left( p \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \right) du + \left(p \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \right) dv \\     &= -q \left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} du + \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} dv \right) + p \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} du + \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} dv \right) \\     &= -q\,dx + p\, dy, \end{align}</math> proving the claimed invariance.  A common example of the Hodge star operator is the case , when it can be taken as the correspondence between vectors and  bivectors. Specifically, for Euclidean space|Euclidean "R"<sup>3</sup> with the basis <math>dx, dy, dz</math> of one-forms often used in vector calculus, one finds that <math display="block">\begin{align}   {\star} \,dx &= dy \wedge dz \\   {\star} \,dy &= dz \wedge dx \\   {\star} \,dz &= dx \wedge dy. \end{align}</math> The Hodge star relates the exterior and cross product in three dimensions: <math display="block">{\star} (\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \qquad {\star} (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf {v}) = \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} .</math> Applied to three dimensions, the Hodge star provides an isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector  is associated with a bivector  and vice versa, that is: <math>\mathbf{A} = {\star} \mathbf{a}, \ \ \mathbf{a} = {\star} \mathbf{A}</math>. The Hodge star can also be interpreted as a form of the geometric correspondence between an axis and an infinitesimal rotation around the axis, with speed equal to the length of the axis vector. An inner product on a vector space <math>V</math> gives an Dual space#Bilinear products and dual spaces|isomorphism <math>V\cong V^*\!</math>  identifying <math>V</math> with its dual space, and the vector space <math>L(V,V)</math> is naturally isomorphic to the tensor product <math>V^*\!\!\otimes V\cong V\otimes V</math>. Thus for <math>V = \mathbb{R}^3</math>, the star mapping <math display="inline">\textstyle \star:V\to\bigwedge^{\!2}\! V \subset V\otimes V</math> takes each vector <math>\mathbf{v}</math> to a bivector <math>\star \mathbf{v} \in V\otimes V</math>, which corresponds to a linear operator <math>L_{\mathbf{v}} : V\to V</math>. Specifically, <math>L_{\mathbf{v}}</math> is a Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric operator, which corresponds to an 3D rotation group#Lie algebra|infinitesimal rotation: that is, the macroscopic rotations around the axis <math>\mathbb{v}</math> are given by the matrix exponential <math>\exp(t L_{\mathbf{v}})</math>. With respect to the basis <math>dx, dy, dz</math> of <math>\R^3</math>, the tensor <math>dx\otimes dy</math> corresponds to a coordinate matrix with 1 in the <math>dx</math> row and <math>dy</math> column, etc., and the wedge <math>dx\wedge dy \,=\, dx\otimes dy - dy\otimes dx</math> is the skew-symmetric matrix <math>\scriptscriptstyle\left \,\!-1\!\!&\!\!0\!\!&\!\!\!\!0\!\!\!\!\!\!  \\ \,0\!\! & \!\!0\!\! & \!\!\!\!0\!\!\!\!\!\! \end{array}\!\!\!\right]</math>, etc. That is, we may interpret the star operator as: <math display="block"> \mathbf{v} = a\,dx + b\,dy + c\,dz \quad\longrightarrow \quad  \star{\mathbf{v}}  \ \cong\ L_{\mathbf{v}}  \ = \left.</math> Under this correspondence, cross product of vectors corresponds to the commutator Lie algebra|Lie bracket of linear operators: <math>L_{\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}} = L_{\mathbf{u}} L_{\mathbf{v}} - L_{\mathbf{v}} L_{\mathbf{u}}</math>.<!-- These dual relations can be implemented using multiplication by the Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)#Unit pseudoscalar|unit pseudoscalar in Clifford algebra#Examples: real and complex Clifford algebras|Cl<sub>3</sub>("R"),  (the vectors  are an orthonormal basis in three-dimensional Euclidean space) according to the relations <math display="block">\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{a}i\,\quad\mathbf{a} = - \mathbf{A} i. </math> The dual of a vector is obtained by multiplication by , as established using the properties of the Geometric product#The geometric product|geometric product of the algebra as follows: <math display="block">\begin{align}   \mathbf{a}i &= \left(a_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + a_3 \mathbf{e}_3\right) \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \\               &= a_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 (\mathbf{e}_1)^2 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \mathbf{e}_1(\mathbf{e}_2)^2 + a_3  \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2(\mathbf{e}_3)^2 \\               &= a_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_3 \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \\               &= (\star \mathbf{a}) \end{align}</math> and also, in the dual space spanned by : <math display="block">\begin{align}   \mathbf{A} i &= \left(A_1 \mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3 + A_2 \mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_1 + A_3 \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\right) \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \\                &= A_1 \mathbf{e}_1 (\mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf ...
