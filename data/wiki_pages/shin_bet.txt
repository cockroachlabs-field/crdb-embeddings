Its motto is ""Magen veLo Yera'e"" (, lit. "Shield and not seen" or "The unseen shield"). The Shin Bet's headquarters are located in northwest Tel Aviv, north of Yarkon Park. It is one of three principal organizations of the Israeli intelligence community, alongside Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Aman (military intelligence) and Mossad (foreign intelligence service). ==Organization== Shabak is believed to have three operational wings: *"The Arab Department:" responsible primarily for Arab-related counter-terrorism|counterterrorism activities in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. *"The Israel and Foreigners Department:" formerly named the Non-Arab Affairs Department. It includes the "Department for Counter-intelligence and Prevention of Subversion in the Jewish Sector", also known as the "Jewish Department". It is responsible for preventing espionage, and for dealing with extremists who carry out actions (such as terrorism) against the state and the Jewish and democratic state|democratic regime. As its original concerns mostly related to the Communist Bloc, it shrank after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union, but rose again in importance in response to Jewish terrorist activity beginning in the early 80s. *"The Protective Security Department:" responsible for protecting high-value individuals and locations in the country such as government officials, embassies, airports, and research facilities. Although a security agency, it is not a part of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, and its chief answers directly to the Prime Minister of Israel. ==Duties and roles== Shabak's duties are safeguarding state security, exposing terrorism|terrorist rings, interrogating terror suspects, providing military intelligence|intelligence for counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, counter-espionage, personal protection of senior public officials, securing important infrastructure and government buildings, and safeguarding Israeli airlines and overseas embassy|embassies. ==History== With the Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli declaration of independence in 1948, the Shabak was founded as a branch of the Israel Defense Forces and was initially headed by Isser Harel (the father of Israeli Intelligence, who later headed the Mossad). Responsibility for Shabak activity was later moved from the IDF to the office of the prime minister. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, Shabak's responsibilities included only internal security affairs. In February 1949 (a short while before the end of the war), its responsibilities were extended to counter-espionage.  (Hebrew) One of the Shabak's leading successes was obtaining a copy of the On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|secret speech made by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, in which he denounced Stalin. A Polish edition of the speech was provided to the Israeli embassy in Warsaw by the boyfriend of the secretary of a Polish communist official. The Shabak's Polish liaison officer conveyed the copy to Israel. The Israeli government then decided to share the information with the United States, which published it with Israeli approval. On the other hand, a study published in 2013 by Matitiahu Mayzel casts doubt on the story, arguing that the speech was not secret and that it was conveyed to the West by multiple sources, including Soviet political and intelligence agencies. A notable achievement in counter-espionage was the 1961 capture of Israel Beer, who was revealed to be a Soviet Espionage|spy. Beer was a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, a senior security commentator and close friend of Ben-Gurion and reached high Israeli circles. Beer was tried and sentenced to ten years in prison (later extended by the Supreme Court to fifteen years, following his appeal), where he died. A year before, Kurt Sitte, a Christianity|Christian German from the Sudetenland and a professor in the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion, was revealed as a Czechoslovakian spy.  (Hebrew) File:Shabak Medal 2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Medal given to Shabak workers on the 40th anniversary of the state of Israel, 1988 In 1967, an Egyptian-Israeli double agent, Rif'at al Gamal/Jacques Bitton, gave Egypt false information about Israel's battle plans, claiming it would begin with ground operations. The Egyptians thus left their aircraft on open runways, which enabled the Israel Air Force to Operation Focus|knock out Egypt's air force within three hours of the outbreak of the Six-Day War. Operation Yated, as it was later known, is considered one of the most successful deceptions in Israeli intelligence history, on a par with Britain's Operation Mincemeat during World War II. After the war, monitoring terrorist activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip became a major part of Shabak's mission. During 1984–1986, Shabak experienced a major crisis following the Kav 300 affair in which four Palestinian militants hijacked a bus. Two of the hijackers were killed in the ensuing standoff and the other two were killed shortly after being taken into custody by Shabak officers, who later covered up the event and conspired to frame a senior Israel Defense Forces|IDF officer.David K. Shipler, "Arab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land". 1986. . pages 89, 90. Following the affair, Shabak head Avraham Shalom was forced to resign. The 1987 Landau Commission, set up to investigate Shabak interrogation methods, criticized the organization and established guidelines to regulate what forms of physical pressure could be used on prisoners. Among the  practices authorised were  "keeping prisoners in excruciatingly uncomfortable postures, covering their heads with filthy and malodorous sacks and depriving them of sleep." Human rights groups in Israel maintained that this amounts to torture.  9 February 2000, BBC A 1995 official report by Miriam Ben-Porat, made public in 2000, showed that Shin Bet "routinely" went beyond the "moderate physical pressure"  authorised  by the Landau Commission. In the report, Israel admitted for the first time that   Palestinian  detainees were  tortured during the First Intifada, between 1988 and 1992. In 1995, the Shin Bet failed to protect the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassinated by right-wing Israeli radical Yigal Amir. Shin Bet had discovered Amir's plans, and a Shin Bet agent was sent to monitor Amir, and reported that Amir was not a threat. Following the assassination, the Shabak director, Carmi Gillon, resigned preemptively. Later, the Shamgar Commission pointed to serious flaws in the personal security unit. Another source of embarrassment and criticism was the violent, provocative and inciting behavior of Avishai Raviv, an espionage|informer of the Shabak's Jewish Unit during the time leading up to the assassination.See the   in Hebrew Later, Raviv was acquitted of the charges that he encouraged Yigal Amir to kill Yitzhak Rabin. A few months after the Rabin assassination, Hamas chief bombmaker Yahya Ayyash was assassinated in a targeted killing in which an explosive device was planted in his cellular phone.Katz, Samuel. "The Hunt for the Engineer". Lyons Press, 2002.  Gillon was replaced by  Israeli Navy admiral Ami Ayalon, who helped to restore the organizational morale, after the debacle of the Rabin assassination, and to rehabilitate its public image. In 2000, Ayalon was replaced by Avi Dichter,  an ex-Sayeret Matkal commando and experienced Shabak agent, who tightened the working relationship with the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli police. Dichter was in charge when the al-Aqsa Intifada erupted. He turned Shabak into a prominent player in the war on terrorism after the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit. In November 2003, four former heads of Shabak (Avraham Shalom, Yaakov Peri, Carmi Gillon and Ami Ayalon) called upon the Government of Israel to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians. In May 2005, Dichter was replaced by Yuval Diskin, who served until 2011. In 2007, the service launched its first-ever public recruitment drive, unveiling a "slick Website" and buying on-line ads in Israel and abroad in a campaign aimed at "attract top-tier computer programmers" to its "cutting-edge" IT division. On March 18, 2008, it was announced that Shabak's official website would also offer a blog, where four of its agents would discuss anonymously how they were recruited, and what sort of work they perform; they would also answer questions sent in by members of the public. The decision to launch the blog was made by the Shin Bet's top brass, including head Yuval Diskin, and is part of an attempt to attract high-tech workers to the agency's growing IT department. According to Shabak officers, the Web site and blog are aimed also at promoting a more accessible and positive public image for the secret service, long associated with "dark, undercover and even violent activity".Yaakov Katz,  , "Jerusalem Post", 17 March 2008. In 2011, Yoram Cohen was chosen as the new head of Shabak, and served until 2016. In 2016, Nadav Argaman was chosen as the new head of Shabak, and assumed office on 8 May 2016. On 11 October 2021, Ronen Bar was announced as the next head of the ISA,{{cite news |author1=Yoni Weiss |title=Ronen Bar Announced as New Shin Bet Head |url=https://hamodia.com/2021/10/11/ronen-bar-anno ...
