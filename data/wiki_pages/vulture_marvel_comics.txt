According to Ditko, Lee wanted the villain to be heavy-set and based on actor Sydney Greenstreet. Ditko designed him to be leaner and more gaunt, feeling he should be swift and fast and also because "The bulkier anything is, the more panel space it has to take up, thereby shrinking panel space for other characters and story panel elements." Since Toomes originally assumed the Vulture alias, several other character have taken on the mantle. The second incarnation, "Blackie Drago", first appeared in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #48 (May 1967), and was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr. Lee created the new version because he thought that Spider-Man looked like a bully fighting a wizened old man. However, the readers wrote in that they did not like the new Vulture, and Lee relented and brought the original back.

Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that exposure to the harness had also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture. The Vulture employs a special electromagnetic harness of his own design that allows him to Flight|fly; his flight is directed by a pair of artificial wings worn on his arms.
