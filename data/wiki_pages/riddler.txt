The character was created by Bill Finger and Dick Sprang, and debuted in "Detective Comics" #140 in October 1948. He has become one of the most enduring enemies of the superhero Batman and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his List of Batman family enemies|rogues gallery. In his comic book appearances, the Riddler is depicted as a criminal mastermind in Gotham City. He has an obsessive compulsion to incorporate riddles, puzzles, and death traps in his schemes to prove his intellectual superiority over Batman and the police. His real name–Edward Nigma–is a pun itself; an "enigma" is a person or thing that is difficult to understand. With this self-conscious use of an elaborate gimmick, the Riddler's crimes are often theatrical and ostentatious. The character commonly wears a domino mask and either a green unitard decorated with question mark prints or a green suit and bowler hat. A black, green, or purple question mark serves as his visual motif. The Riddler has been adapted into numerous forms of media, having been portrayed in live action by Frank Gorshin and John Astin on the 1960s television series "Batman (TV series)|Batman", Jim Carrey in the 1995 film "Batman Forever", Cory Michael Smith on the 2014 Fox Broadcasting Network|Fox series "Gotham (TV series)|Gotham", and Paul Dano in the 2022 film The Batman (film)|"The Batman". John Glover (actor)|John Glover, Robert Englund, Wally Wingert, and others have provided the character's voice ranging from animation to video games.  ==Fictional character biography==  File:Detective140.JPG|thumb|right|Cover of "Detective Comics" #140 (October 1948 in comics|1948), the first appearance of the Riddler.

After a teacher announces that a contest will be held over who can solve a puzzle the fastest, Nigma sets his sights on winning this, craving the glory and satisfaction that will come with the victory. He breaks into the school at night to practice the puzzle until he is able to solve it in under a minute. Due to this he wins the contest and is given a book of riddles as a prize. His cheating rewarded, Edward embraced the mastery of puzzles of all kinds, eventually becoming a carnival employee who excelled at cheating his customers out of their money with his bizarre puzzles and mind games. He soon finds himself longing for greater challenges and thrills and dons the disguise of the "Riddler" to challenge Batman, believing him to be a worthy adversary. In his first encounter with the Dynamic Duo, Riddler first tried to confound the crime-fighters with his infamous double-entry Riddle Clues and then tried to kill them both in a booby-trapped glass maze on a pier, sealing the door so they couldn't leave the structure before it exploded, only for Batman and Robin to escape and the Riddler "vanishing" after getting knocked into the sea by the explosion, leaving only his trademark "?" floating in the water."Detective Comics" #140. DC Comics.   Riddler's history is the same as his Golden Age counterpart. Riddler once collaborated with Joker (character)|Joker and Penguin (character)|Penguin in using an experimental gas on Batman which turned him into a Bat-Hulk. Metamorpho was able to restore him to normal and they apprehended Riddler, Joker, and Penguin."The Brave and the Bold" #68. DC Comics.

DC Comics.  In "Batman: The Long Halloween", the Riddler appears as an informant. The Riddler is hired by Carmine Falcone|Carmine "The Roman" Falcone to tell him the identity of the Holiday (comics)|Holiday killer. Falcone eventually loses his patience with Riddler and has his daughter throw him out on the 1st of April. Outside Falcone's he is confronted by the Holiday killer who fires several shots at him without harming him due to it being April Fools' Day|April Fool's, the killer also leaves several items pertaining to their identity at the scene. This may be why Riddler was left alive, as matters are traditionally reversed on the holiday. He appeared again in the same chapter of the story in which Harvey Dent is disfigured when Batman comes to him for information about the attack. He plays a slightly larger role in the story's sequel "Batman: Dark Victory", in which Batman turns to him to figure out the significance of the lost games of hangman that are left at the scenes of the Hangman (DC Comics)|Hangman killer's crimes. He later showed up as a member of Two-Face's jury during the Hangman's trial. In "Catwoman: When in Rome", he joins Selina Kyle on a trip to Italy in search of his fellow rogue's origins. It is there that he manipulates her into believing that some of Batman's most dangerous foes are after her. He has his henchmen employ several gimmicks and weapons used by the Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze and the Joker to achieve this. He hopes to extract Batman's real identity from her, but to his dismay, she actually doesn't know or care.

He hijacks the bus and begins asking riddles, killing and robbing anyone that gets them wrong. Question (comics)|Question quickly subdues him by asking him Kōan|philosophical riddles in return. He is outwitted and has a mental breakdown before being set free as a reward for getting one last riddle right."The Question" #26. DC Comics. In the one-shot "Riddler: The Riddle Factory", the Riddler becomes the host of an underground game show that focuses on digging up dirt on celebrities. Many of the famous people that he humiliates end up committing suicide shortly afterward, suggesting that perhaps Riddler did more than just inspire their deaths. In the end, his actions turn out to be a front for his attempts to find the hidden treasures of "Scarface" Scarpelli, a Gotham City gangster who lived long before Batman's reign of crimefighting. In the three-part "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight" storyline "The Primal Riddle", written by Steve Englehart, the Riddler engineers one of his greatest deathtraps: Batman is thrown into a narrow pit that is slowly filling up with water. The walls are electrically wired, and a set of bumpers are the only thing that prevents the water from touching the walls and causing Batman to die by electrocution. The only options Batman appears to have are death by electrocution and death by drowning, but as always, Batman manages to tamper with the trap's design and develop a route of escape."Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight" #109-#111. DC Comics. After Harley Quinn briefly breaks free of her devotion to the Joker, she attempts to hold up a large party at Wayne Manor, only to find that the Riddler is targeting the building also. The two gangs engage in a firefight, but Harley gains the upper hand when Big Barda (who was secretly allied with her at the time) interrupts the conflict and captures the Riddler and his men. During the storyline, Riddler makes constant allusions to a "mystery" that is hidden within the mansion, and after his apprehension, damage done to the building causes the entrance to the Batcave to open. Riddler sees this, and then declares that he has "solved the riddle of Wayne Manor"."Harley Quinn" #6-#7. DC Comics. During this period, he attacks Black Canary and Green Arrow in Star City (comics)|Star City, and he is easily defeated. This event helps lay the foundations for Riddler's future confrontations with Green Arrow. During a crisis caused when Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth was broken, resulting in the laws of truth breaking down and causing reality to be shaped by the perceptions of individuals, one of the symptoms was when Batman found himself unable to solve any of the Riddler's riddles but was nevertheless still able to defeat Riddler as Riddler himself could not solve the riddles eithermost likely reflecting the public idea of Riddler's puzzles being insolubleclaiming that he managed to "improvise" to defeat Riddler. His low reputation among heroes and villains was reflected when the Wally West|Flash noted that Batman having trouble with Riddler was a clear sign that the world was ending."JLA" #64 (May 2002). DC Comics.  In the 12-part storyline "Batman: Hush", it is revealed that Riddler suffers from cancer (specifically a brain tumor), which also afflicted the mother of Dr. Hush (character)|Thomas Elliot. Riddler uses one of Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits to cure himself and offers Elliot the chance to cure his mother as well, provided he pays a large sum of money. However, Elliott is, in fact, eager for his mother to die to inherit her fortune. Elliott, who goes on to secretly become the masked criminal Hush, explains he wants to get revenge on his childhood friend Bruce Wayne. The two of them agree to work together and Riddler sets Killer Croc, Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Joker, Clayface, and Scarecrow out to destroy Batman, with Ra's al Ghul, Talia al Ghul, and Lady Shiva being temporarily drawn into the scheme as well. During the psychosis|psychotic break that follows exposure to the Lazarus Pit, the Riddler deduces Batman's secret identity; he then reveals his knowledge to Hush. He has Clayface shapeshifting|shapeshift into the form of Batman's presumed deceased protégé Jason Todd to torment Batman, who is haunted by the former Robin's death. Batman first thinks that Riddler had stolen Todd's corpse and hidden it, but it was Retcon|revealed in a later storyline, "Batman: Under the Hood", that Todd was alive the whole time and had personally played a role in Riddler and Hush's scheme. When the Riddler threatens to expose Batman's secret identity, the Caped Crusader mockingly labels it an empty threat, pointing out that if Riddler revealed the answer to the riddle "who is Batman?", it would become worthless, something Riddler would not be able to stand. In addition, Batman warns him that if he reveals the secret, it would give Ra's al Ghul a vital clue that he used a Lazarus Pit without his permission, and the League of Assassins would subsequently retaliate against him."Batman" #619. DC Comics.  The fallout from the Riddler's failed scheme is played out in "Batman: Gotham Knights" #50-53. In the story "Pushback", Hush reappears and beats Riddler senseless across a rooftop. Seeking refuge, Riddler goes to the Joker and the Penguin. He offers to tell the Joker who had killed his pregnancy|pregnant wife Jeannie if the Clown Prince of Crime would protect him from Hush. Joker immediately agrees, but eventually, Hush, with the help of the impostor Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus, defeats him, forcing Riddler to flee for his life. In "Detective Comics" #797-799, the Riddler seeks shelter from Poison Ivy only to be humiliated. Riddler and Poison Ivy then face off in a physical duel, which Ivy wins easily. As revealed in "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight" #185-189, the Riddler is stripped of his deductive powers and left to rot as a member of Gotham City's vast and invisible homelessness|homeless population. A chance encounter with an ex-National Security Agency|NSA codebreaker gives him a positive environment in which to recover his mind. During that stay, he experiences an induced flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback that leads him to realize that his father had abused him many years ago. Envious of his son's academic achievements in school, and unable to understand his brilliance, his father believed he had cheated on his accomplishments, and beat him out of jealousy. Once Riddler discovers this, he also realizes that his compulsion is born out of a strong desire, to tell the truth, to prove his innocence of deception. Having made this connection, the Riddler spends some of his vast fortunes, acquired over many years of crime, to get minor plastic surgery and extensive tattooing, covering most of his torso with his trademark question insignia. He returns and kills the codebreakerwho had pieced together his identity but couldn't act on itthen promptly steals a priceless scroll out from under Batman's nose. Since then, Riddler has spent most of his time either legally amassing a huge fortune or attacking various heroes to prove his new-found power.
