He was best known as the front-man of Skrewdriver, a Punk rock|Punk band which, from 1982 onwards, he rebranded as a Rock Against Communism band. He raised money through Nationalism|nationalist concerts with his Blood & Honour network. ==Biography== Born in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, Donaldson attended Baines School in nearby Poulton-le-Fylde|Poulton, where he met Sean McKay, Phil Walmsley, and John Grinton. They formed the Cover version|cover band Tumbling Dice, who played songs by the Rolling Stones and other bands. In 1975, they formed Skrewdriver. After the original Skrewdriver lineup disbanded in 1979, Donaldson formed a new lineup and began to write songs for youth and music in the National Front. The new version of Skrewdriver openly promoted far-right groups such as the British National Front|National Front and raised funds for them (and affiliated organisations) through the White Noise Records label. Skrewdriver became known for its involvement in the White nationalism|White Nationalist movement and its associated music genre, Rock Against Communism. In 1987, Donaldson founded Blood & Honour, nationalist music and organised concerts. Donaldson also became leader of two other bands—The Klansmen (a rockabilly band) and White Diamond (a hard rock/heavy metal music|heavy metal band)—and released several solo albums. Along with Skrewdriver guitarist Stigger (Stephen Calladine), he recorded the albums "Patriotic Ballads" volumes 1 and 2, which included covers of Folk music|folk songs such as "No Man's Land (Eric Bogle song)|The Green Fields of France". Donaldson's voice also appeared in the song "The Invisible Empire". On the night of 23 September 1993, Donaldson was involved in a car crash in Derbyshire that resulted in his death the following day, at the age of 36. ==Discography==  *"Justice for the Cottbus Six" (1992) (Rock-O-Rama)  *"Patriotic Ballads" (1991) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Patriotic Ballads II – Our Time Will Come" (1992) (Rock-O-Rama)  *"All Skrewed Up" (1977) (Chiswick) (later re-issued as "The Early Years" w. extra tracks) *"Peel Session" (1977) BBC Radio 1 *"Back with a Bang" (1982) (Rock-O-Rama) *"The Voice of Britain" (1983) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Hail the New Dawn" (1984) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Blood & Honour" (1985) (Rock-O-Rama) *"White Rider (Skrewdriver album)|White Rider" (1987) (Rock-O-Rama) *"After the Fire" (1988) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Warlord" (1989) (Rock-O-Rama) *"The Strong Survive" (1990) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Freedom What Freedom" (1992) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Hail Victory" (1994) (ISD Records)  *"No Turning Back" (1989) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Slay The Beast" (1990) (Rock-O-Rama) *"Patriot" (1991) (Rock-O-Rama)  *"Fetch the Rope" (LP, 1989 / Klan Records) (CD, 1991 / Rock-O-Rama Records) *"Rebel with a Cause" (LP, 1990 / Klan Records) (CD, 1991 / Rock-O-Rama Records) *"Rock 'n' Roll Patriots" (LP, 1991 / Klan Records) (CD. 1991 / Rock-O-Rama Records) Single: *"Johnny Joined the Klan" (1989 / Klan Records) (3 Songs from the "Fetch the Rope" LP)  *"The Reaper" (1991) (Rock-O-Rama) *"The Power & The Glory" (1992) (Glory Discs) ==Further reading== * * *, Patterns of Prejudice (2013)  * Mark Green "Ian Stuart Donaldson – Memories", PC Records (2007) * Mark Green "Ian Stuart Donaldson – Rock 'n Roll Patriot", PC Records (2009) ==References==      Category:1957 births Category:1993 deaths Category:English rock guitarists Category:English male singers Category:English neo-Nazis Category:People from Blackpool Category:People from Poulton-le-Fylde Category:Road incident deaths in England Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:20th-century English singers Category:20th-century British guitarists Category:20th-century British male singers
