It opened on October 4, 1975, and the last commercial passenger flight took off on October 31, 2004. The main role of the airport today is Cargo airline|cargo flights, but it is also home to MEDEVAC and general aviation flights, and is a manufacturing base for Bombardier Aerospace and Airbus A220|Airbus Canada, where final assembly of Regional airliner|regional jet (Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700, CRJ900 and CRJ1000) aircraft and the Airbus A220 (formerly Bombardier CSeries) is conducted. The former passenger terminal Airport apron|apron is now a racing course, and the terminal building was demolished in 2016. Prior to the demolition of the terminal, Montréal–Mirabel International Airport was classified as an airport of entry (AOE) by Nav Canada and was staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). A smaller AOE is still available at the Hélibellule FBO It was one of two airports in Canada with sufficient right-of-way that can be expanded to accommodate 50 million passengers per year, the other being Toronto Pearson International Airport. A lack of traffic meant that Mirabel was never expanded beyond its first phase. It is one of only two non-capital airports with fewer than 200,000 passengers a year to be part of the National Airports System (Canada)|National Airports System. The airport was intended to replace the existing Montréal–Trudeau International Airport|Dorval Airport as the eastern air gateway to Canada. Accordingly, from 1975 to 1997, all international flights to and from Montreal (except for flights to and from the United States) were required to use Mirabel. However, Mirabel's distant location, the lack of adequate transport links to urban centres and the continued operation of domestic flights from Dorval Airport made Mirabel very unpopular with travellers and airlines. It did not help that Montreal's economy declined relative to that of Toronto during the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, passenger levels never approached the levels that had been anticipated, and indeed remained lower than what Dorval could handle when renovated. When the decision was made to consolidate Montreal's passenger traffic at one airport, Dorval was chosen, and Mirabel was relegated to the role of a cargo airport. Mirabel thus turned out to be a white elephant., CLIFFORD KRAUSS, "The New York Times", October 3, 2004 Dorval Airport was renamed Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, after the Canadian Prime Minister whose government initiated the Mirabel project, the aim of which was to close and replace the Dorval airport. By surface area, it was the largest airport in the world that had ever been envisioned, with a planned area of ; King Fahd International Airport in Saudi Arabia, completed in 1999, eventually surpassed its surface area. In 1989,  of the  were deeded back to their original owners.  ==Development==  In the 1960s, Montreal experienced a tremendous economic boom. Massive construction projects, including the Montreal Metro and those linked with the hosting of Expo 67, brought the city international status. More and more visitors were arriving to the city, especially by airplane but not always by choice. The federal government required European airlines to make Montreal their only Canadian destination. That resulted in 15–20% annual growth in passenger traffic at the city's Dorval Airport. Optimistic about the city's future and its continuing ability to attract more and more visitors, government officials decided to build a new airport that would be more than able to absorb increased passenger traffic well into the 21st century. The Canadian Department of Transport studied five possible sites for Montreal's new airport: Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ( to the southeast), Vaudreuil-Dorion ( to the west), Joliette ( to the north), Saint-Amable, Quebec|St-Amable ( to the southeast), and Sainte-Scholastique, Quebec|Ste-Scholastique ( to the northwest). The federal government proposed that the airport should be located at Vaudreuil-Dorion. Not only was it well served by existing road and rail routes, but it was close enough to both Ottawa and Montreal to serve as the gateway for both cities. However, Premier of Quebec|Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, who had a frosty relationship with Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, reportedly did not want such an important project to be placed so close to the Ontario border. The Bourassa government preferred that the new airport be situated in Drummondville ( to the east).  Image:Mirabelintlarpttransportlinks.png|300px|thumb|Diagram of planned transport links serving Mirabel Airport In March 1969 the Government of Canada|federal and Government of Quebec|provincial governments reached a compromise to locate at the St. Scholastique site, and proposals were drawn up to expropriate , an area larger than the entire city of Montreal. This area is served only by a long road link via Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute 15 and Quebec Autoroute 50|Autoroute 50. An additional link via Quebec Autoroute 13|Autoroute 13 was planned but never completed. Also planned was the connection of Autoroute 50 to the National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa/Gatineau area, a goal which would not be achieved until decades later, in 2012. The federal government Eminent domain|expropriation resulted in making Mirabel the world's largest airport by property area. (King Fahd International Airport near Dammam in Saudi Arabia later surpassed Mirabel as the world's largest airport by property area, a record it still retains). The airport's operations zone, which encompassed what was eventually built plus expansion room, amounted to only , about 19% of the total area of the airport. The federal government planned to use the excess land as a noise buffer and as an industrial development zone (which was never started). This attracted the ire of the people of St. Scholastique who protested vehemently against the expropriation of their land. Nevertheless, construction started in June 1970 under the auspices of BANAIM, a government organization formed to build the airport. The architects charged with the design were Papineau, Gérin-Lajoie, LeBlanc, Edwards. High-speed rail transit (the system was to be capable of speeds from  for the Montréal–Mirabel run), initially to be called TRRAMM ("Transport Rapide Régional Aéroportuaire Montréal–Mirabel"), was intended to be completed at a later date. However, it never got beyond the drawing board. The TRRAMM system was also intended to eventually be expanded to other parts of the Montreal region. The major stumbling block for the TRRAMM project was funding. The federal, provincial, and municipal governments never managed to find enough cash to fund the highly ambitious and expensive rapid transit project. <!--In today's terms, the single Montreal–Mirabel TRRAMM line would have cost "at least" a billion Canadian dollars.--> Thus, Mirabel was forced to cope with an inadequate road system and non-existent rail transit, supplemented only by express buses. ==Operational history and decline== File:Air India Old.jpg|thumb|Air India Boeing 747-200 at Montréal–Mirabel International Airport in 1983 Image:NKN-2007-08-05 144714 MIRABEL AIRPORT(Yvan Leduc author for Wikipedia).Jpg|thumb|The passenger terminal before its demolition Montréal–Mirabel International Airport opened for business on October 4, 1975, in time for the 1976 Summer Olympics. In the rush to get the airport open in time for the Olympics, it was decided to transfer flights to Mirabel in two stages. International flights were transferred immediately, while domestic and US flights would continue to be served by Dorval airport until 1982. The federal government predicted that Dorval would be completely saturated by 1985 as part of its justification for building Mirabel. They also projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal's airports annually, with 17 million of those through Mirabel. However, three factors dramatically reduced the amount of projected Aviation|air traffic into Dorval. After 1976, Mirabel and Dorval began to decline in importance because of the increasing use in the 1980s of longer-range jets that did not need to refuel in Montreal before crossing the Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic; the use of longer-range aircraft was made more attractive by national energy policies that provided Montreal refineries with feedstock at prices substantially below world prices, starting in 1975 and ending in the 1980s with the drop in world oil prices. In addition, the simultaneous operation of Mirabel (international flights) and Dorval (continental flights) (see below) made Montreal less attractive to international airlines. A European passenger who wanted to travel to another destination in Canada or fly to the United States had to take an hour-long bus ride from Mirabel to Dorval. The complicated transfer process put Montreal at a significant disadvantage. The planned but unbuilt highways and incomplete train routes compounded the problem. The international airlines responded by shifting their routes to Toronto. One of the obstacles of the planned transfer from Dorval to Mirabel was Air Canada's desire to keep flights in Dorval (and its proximity with AVEOS workshops) and the connections in Pearson Airport.Archived at  and the :    By 1991, Mirabel and Dorval were handling only a total of 8 million passengers and 112,000 tons of cargo annually, while Toronto was handling 18.5 million passengers and 312,000 tons of cargo. Mirabel alone never managed to exceed 3 million passengers per year in its existence as a passenger airport. It soon became apparent that Montreal did not need a second airport.{{Cite web|url=https://bennetkelley.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/quebecs-fateful-day/|title=Quebec's Fateful Day: Embracing Decline in the Name of Culture|date=J ...
