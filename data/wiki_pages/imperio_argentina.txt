She performed onstage in her native Argentina, where she had a long and successful career. At that time, her stage name was "Pettit Imperio". But her most successful moments came after she moved to Spain. It was there that she changed her name to "Imperio Argentina", as a way to honor her "other country". While in Spain, del Río participated in many movies, and she participated frequently in television and radio. She obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999. ==Death== In January 2003, she suffered an angina attack and was admitted to the University Hospital of Malaga.

Her younger child was her daughter, Alejandra Goyanes Nile, by another marriage. She was married twice. As a divorcee, she could not, in Francoist Spain, legally marry Joaquín Goyanes, the father of her daughter. ==Selected filmography==  * "Sister San Sulpicio (1927 film)|Sister San Sulpicio" (1927) * "Restless Hearts" (1928) * "Los claveles de la virgen" (1929) *  "El amor solfeando" (1930) * "Lo mejor es reír" (1931)  *"Cinópolis" (1931) * "Su noche de bodas" (1931) *  "La casa es seria" (1932) * "When Do You Commit Suicide?
