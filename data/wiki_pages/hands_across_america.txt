   "Hands Across America" was a public fundraising event on Sunday, May 25, 1986, when 5 to 6.5 million people holding hands|held hands for 15 minutes in an attempt to form a continuous human chain (politics)|human chain across the contiguous United States. The attempt to have a complete line of people across the country failed, although the number of participants would have been sufficient to succeed if they had been spread out over the full length of the planned course. The various gaps in the line between participants were filled using ribbons, ropes, or banners. Many participants donated $10 each to reserve their place in line. The proceeds were donated to local charities to fight hunger and homelessness and help those in poverty. The event raised about $15 million for charities after operating costs. == Cities ==                         }} File:Hands Across America in Gaithersburg, Maryland (May 1986), by Judy Christensen.jpg|thumb|Gaithersburg, Maryland, participating in "Hands Across America" in May 1986.

The event was conceived and organized by Ken Kragen. Event implementation was through USA for Africa under the direction of Marty Rogol, the founding Executive Director. A theme song, entitled "Hands Across America," was played simultaneously on hundreds of radio stations at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. North American Eastern Standard Time Zone|Eastern time (noon Pacific Standard Time Zone|Pacific time). The song was written by Marc Blatte, John Carney, and Larry Gottlieb, and featured lead vocals by session singers Joe Cerisano and Sandy Farina, and the band Toto (band)|Toto. The song peaked at #65 on the Billboard Hot 100|"Billboard" Hot 100 in 1986. Hands Across America was a project of USA for Africa. USA for Africa produced "We Are the World" and the combined revenues raised by both events raised almost $100 million to fight famine in Africa and hunger and homelessness in the United States. The date and time chosen for the event inadvertently conflicted with another charity fundraiser, Sport Aid, which was organized by USA for Africa on the same day.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/26/world/20-million-run-to-raise-money-for-the-starving-in-africa.html Since Hands Across America was much better publicized in the United States, only 4,000 runners participated in New York City for Sport Aid.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/26/world/20-million-run-to-raise-money-for-the-starving-in-africa.html == Continuity of the chain ==  In order to allow the maximum number of people to participate, the path linked major cities and meandered back and forth within the cities. There were sections where the "line" was six to ten people deep. Enough people participated that if an average of all the participants had been taken and spread evenly along the route standing four feet (1.2&nbsp;m) apart, an unbroken chain across the 48 contiguous states would have been able to be formed.The event aimed to raise money to fight poverty and hunger by literally uniting millions of Americans in a single cause: forming a human chain spanning the continental United States. Together, sponsors and corporations accounted for roughly 2000 miles of the 4125-mile chain. == Legacy == Hands Across America raised $34 million. According to "The New York Times", a net $15 million was distributed after deducting operating costs. Hands Across America was featured in the video for Michael Jackson's song "Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry". Hands Across America was featured in the 1992 episode of "The Simpsons", "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" in which Homer Simpson reminisces about the memories sitting on their couch. One such memory is his sitting on the couch while his wife and children, along with the Flanders and Lovejoy families, participate in the event while watching coverage which notes that "except for large gaps in the western states, Hands Across America was a complete success". The event figures significantly in the plot of the 2019 American horror film "Us (2019 film)|Us", directed by Jordan Peele. Hands Across America also featured in a 2016 episode of the sitcom "The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs". == See also == * Baltic Way * Hands Across Britain * Hands Across Hawthorne == References ==  == Further reading ==  *  *  *  * , December 1, 1986 Category:Contiguous United States Category:Charity events in the United States Category:May 1986 events in the United States Category:Human chains (politics)
