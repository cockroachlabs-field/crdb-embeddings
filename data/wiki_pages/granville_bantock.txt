With his brother Leedham Bantock he wrote a couple of music hall songs which met with some success. He founded a music magazine, "The New Quarterly Music Review", but this lasted only a few years. In 1897, he became conductor at the New Brighton Tower concerts, where he promoted the works of Joseph Holbrooke, Frederic Hymen Cowen, Charles Steggall, Edward German, Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Corder and others, frequently devoting whole concerts to a single composer. He was also conductor of the Liverpool Orchestral Society with which he premiered Frederick Delius|Delius's "Brigg Fair" on 18 January 1908. He became the principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music in 1900. He was a close friend of fellow composer Havergal Brian. He was Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham from 1908 to 1934 (in which post he succeeded Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar)..

He was Knight Bachelor|knighted in 1930. His students included Anthony Bernard, Lilian Elkington, Eric Fogg and Dorothy Howell (composer)|Dorothy Howell. He was influential in the founding of the City of Birmingham orchestra (later the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra), whose first performance in September 1920 was of his overture "Saul". Bantock's "Hebridean Symphony" was recorded by the CBO on 28 January 1925 at Riley Hall, Constitution Hill, Birmingham. This acoustic version, conducted by Adrian Boult, was never released. His music was influenced by folk song of the Hebrides (as in his 1915 "Hebridean Symphony") and the works of Richard Wagner. Many of his works have an Exoticism|"exotic" element, including the choral epic "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar Khayyám" (1906–09).Foreman, Lewis (2007),   (PDF), Chandos Records. Retrieved 27 June 2011. Among his other better-known works are the overture "The Pierrot of the Minute" (1908) and the "Pagan Symphony" (1928). Many of his works have been commercially recorded since the early 1990s. From 1926 to 1933 his Birmingham home was Metchley Lodge (now Metchley Abbey; despite the name, the building has no religious connection), which a Birmingham Civic Society blue plaque on the building records. Shortly after the composer's death in London, in 1946, a Bantock Society was established. Its first president was Jean Sibelius, whose music Bantock championed during the early years of the century. Sibelius dedicated his Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony to Bantock. Edward Elgar dedicated the second of his "Pomp and Circumstance Marches" to Bantock. In 1898 he married Helena von Schweitzer (1868–1961) who acted as a librettist for him. Granville Bantock was also the father-in-law of the composer Margaret More (1903-1966) via her marriage to Granville's son, Raymond Bantock. Their son, Granville Bantock's grandson, is Gavin Bantock, a poet. ==Bibliography== Four biographies have been published on Granville Bantock. The first was authored by his long-time friend and 'secretary', 'Colonel' H. O. Anderton for the "Living Masters of Music" series in 1915. A brief pamphlet (with a portrait) by King Palmer, part of the Paxton Miniature Biographies series, appeared in 1947. A 'personal portrait' of Bantock by his daughter was published by J. M. Dent|Dent in 1972. It is an engaging read and contains a number of photographs. "An Introduction to the Life and Work of Sir Granville Bantock" by Vincent Budd, was published in 2000 by Gnosis Press. It is also illustrated and contains a discographical guide. A larger volume is in progress. In addition to these there is a doctoral thesis by Trevor Bray - "Granville Bantock: his life and music" - submitted in 1972 to Cambridge University. An extract was published by Triad Press the following year as "Bantock: Music in the Midlands before the First World War".  In 2020 J.C. Dressler published "Granville Bantock (1868–1946): a Guide to Research" (Clemson University Press/Liverpool University Press).
