He is also the last Chancellor of the Exchequer to sit in the House of Lords. Born in Paris as the son of a prominent diplomat, Stanhope pursued a military career. Although he also served in Flanders and Italy, he is best remembered for his service in Portugal and Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was the first British Governor of Minorca, which he Capture of Minorca (1708)|captured from the Spanish in 1708. In 1710 he commanded the British contingent of the Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Allied Army which occupied Madrid, having won a decisive victory at the Battle of Zaragoza. Having then evacuated the Spanish capital, Stanhope's rearguard on the retreat to Barcelona were overwhelmed and forced to surrender at Battle of Brihuega|Brihuega. Paroled, he returned to Britain and pursued a political career as a Whig (British political party)|Whig. A supporter of the Hanoverian Succession he was rewarded with office by George I of Great Britain|George I in 1714. As Southern Secretary he oversaw the negotiation of an Anglo-French Alliance (1716-31)|Anglo-French Alliance. Emerging as the dominant figure in government after 1717, following the Whig Split, he led Britain to success in a War of the Quadruple Alliance|new Spanish War and suppressed a Jacobite rising of 1719|Jacobite Rising in 1719. However the government was overtaken by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble and he died in office. He is occasionally mentioned as an alternative candidate to Robert Walpole as Britain's first Prime Minister.Pearce p. 1 ==Background and education== Stanhope was born in Paris in 1673, the eldest of the seven children of Alexander Stanhope (1638–1707), and his wife Katherine (died 1718), the daughter and co-heir of Arnold Burghill, of Thinghall Parva, Withington, Herefordshire, by his second wife Grizell, co-heir of John Prise of Ocle Pyrchard, Herefordshire. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1688. Stanhope accompanied his father, then English Ambassador to Madrid, to Habsburg Spain|Spain in 1690, and obtained some knowledge of that country which was very useful to him in later life. A little later he went to Italy where, as afterwards in Flanders, he served as a volunteer against France, and in 1695 he secured a commission in the English army. In 1701 Stanhope entered the British House of Commons|House of Commons, but he continued his career as a soldier and was in Spain and Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal during the earlier stages of the War of the Spanish Succession. ==Spanish Campaigns==   During the opening stages of the war he was in Ireland on recruiting duty. He desperately sought a chance of combat, and was given permission to accompany the James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde's expedition to Cadiz.Williams. "Stanhope". p. 26 The Battle of Cádiz (1702)|attempt to capture Cadiz failed, but the expedition enjoyed success on the return journey at the Battle of Vigo Bay.  In 1703 he served with the Duke of Marlborough's Army in the Low Countries, having arrived too late to take part in the Siege of Bonn (1703)|Siege of Bonn.Williams. "Stanhope" p.31-32 His regiment was then transferred to Lisbon. Due to Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal's entry into the war on the Allied side, a large British continent was sent to assist them. While Stanhope was in Lisbon recovering from an attack of fever his regiment was part of a Portuguese-commanded garrison which surrendered the town of Portalegre, Portugal|Portalegre.Williams. "Stanhope". p. 34   In 1705 he served in Spain under Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough, notably at the Siege of Barcelona (1705)|Siege of Barcelona and in 1706 he was appointed English minister in Spain, but his duties were still military as well as diplomatic, and in 1708, after some differences with Peterborough, who favoured defensive measures only, he was made commander-in-chief of the British forces in that country.    File:Future Emperor Charles VI, Austrian School, late 17th Century.jpg|thumb|200px|Stanhope fought to put the Allied candidate Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria on the Spanish throne Taking the offensive he captured Mahón|Port Mahon, Minorca. During the operation his younger brother Philip Stanhope (naval officer)|Philip Stanhope, a naval officer, was killed.  After a visit to England in which he took part in the Impeachment in the United Kingdom|impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, he returned to Spain for the campaign of 1710, with Allied victories at Battle of Almenar|Almenar and Battle of Saragossa|Saragossa in July and August enabling Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles to enter Madrid in September. On the back of these triumphs, Stanhope was selected as Whigs (British political party)|Whig candidate for the Westminster seat in the 1710 General Election, with his cousin Lt-General Sherington Davenport as proxy in his absence.  Unlike many constituencies, Westminster had a relatively large electorate of over 10,000 and its proximity to both Court and Parliament meant the result often influenced others. Almenar was used to promote 'brave, virtuous Stanhope' but his Tory opponent Thomas Crosse easily won the seat aided by the satirist Jonathan Swift who published thinly disguised accusations of Stanhope's homosexuality. The Tories won the General election in December by a landslide, by which time Stanhope was a prisoner in Spain but this theme was to form an important part of his future image.   Lack of support from the local population meant the Allies entered an almost deserted Madrid and were effectively isolated when Portuguese forces were prevented from crossing into Spain. In November, the Allies left Madrid for Catalonia in separate detachments, one of 5,000 under Stanhope and the second of 12,000 under the Austrian Starhemberg. Stanhope's division was taken by surprise and forced to surrender by a French army led by Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme at Battle of Brihuega|Brihuega on 9 December 1710. The next day Vendôme followed this up by defeating Starhemberg at Battle of Villaviciosa|Villaviciosa; these defeats were a devastating setback to Allied ambitions in Spain.Holmes p.356-357 Although Allied forces continued to operate out of Catalonia, British commitment to the war was already waning under the new Tory government and Stanhope's replacement as British commander in Spain the John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll took no offensive action. Of great significance was the death of Emperor Joseph I in April 1711 which meant Archduke Charles became Emperor Charles VI. This caused Britain to withdraw from the war since a Spanish and Austrian union threatened the European balance of power, and was as unwelcome as a French one. Philip V of Spain|Philip V retained the Spanish throne, although lost many of Spain's traditional territories. Later Stanhope would admit to Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne that he believed that the Spanish campaign was flawed in its general strategy, and even with more troops deployed there would struggle given the general preference of the Spanish population for Philip over Charles.Williams. "Stanhope" p. 118 Most of the prisoners taken at Brihuega were quickly exchanged but Stanhope himself remained a prisoner in Spain and only returned to England in August 1712, coming via Paris where he encountered the Tory politician Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John who was there negotiating a peace treaty with France.Williams. "Stanhope" p. 121 ==Political career, 1712–1721== Once back in Britain he now abandoned his military career and moved wholly into politics. He soon sat for another seat, Wendover, and became one of the leaders of the British Whig Party|Whig opposition in the House of Commons to Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley's Tory administration. In particular he opposed the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht by which Britain unilaterally made peace with France and abandoned its allies. He was a staunch supporter of the House of Hanover. Once George I of Great Britain|George I succeeded to the throne following the death of Queen Anne in 1714, he replaced the Tory government with a largely Whig one. Several senior Tories were either imprisoned or fled into exile due to their perceived support of the Jacobitism|Jacobite James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart.   In September 1714 he was appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department. With Robert Walpole|Walpole he provided the leadership of the House of Commons. In early 1715 the new government's position was secured when it won a decisive 1715 British general election|election victory.Williams. "Stanhope" p. 169 He was mainly responsible for the measures which were instrumental in crushing the Jacobite rising of 1715. He forwarded the passing of the Septennial Act 1716|Septennial Act in 1716 that established that general elections should be held every seven years. In July 1716 he accompanied George I on his return to Hanover.Williams. "Stanhope" p. 200 He acted as George I's foreign minister, and only just failed to conclude a Anglo-French Alliance (1716–31)|treaty of alliance with France in 1716. In 1717 there was a dramatic schism in the Whig Party with Stanhope and Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Sunderland forming one grouping while Walpole and Townshend opposed them. Walpole led his supporters into opposition, coinciding with a similar dispute within the royal family between George I and his son George II of Great Britain|George, Prince of Wales. This Whig Split divided the dominant Whig movement for three years.  File:James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope by Johan van Diest.jpg|thumb|200px|1718 portrait by Johan van Diest. In 1717, consequent on changes in the ministry, Stanhope was made First Lord of the Treasury, and was the last Chancellor of the Exchequer to sit in the House of Lords.  A year later he returned to his former office of secretary for the southern department. On 3 July 1717, he was created "Baron Stanhope of Elvaston" and "Viscount Stanhope of Mahon" and, on 14 April 1718, "Earl Stanhope". He was in all but name "Prime Minister" and is sometimes presented as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, rather than Sir Robert Walpole who is more usually considered as that figure. Domestically his government suffered a defeat when the Impeachment of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford|Impeachment of Robert Harley, former first minister, ended in his acquittal in July 1717.   He saw Britain's principal foreign policy goals as containing the threat of Spanish, Austrian or Russian expansionist tendencies. His activity was now shown ...
