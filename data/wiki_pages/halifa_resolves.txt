 Image:Flag of North Carolina.svg|thumb|right|275px|The flag of North Carolina|North Carolinian flag commemorates the Halifax Resolves by bearing the date of its adoption: April 12, 1776. The "Halifax Resolves" was a name later given to the resolution (law)|resolution adopted by the North Carolina Provincial Congress on April 12, 1776. The adoption of the resolution was the first official action in the Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies calling for independence from Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain during the American Revolution. The Halifax Resolves helped pave the way for the presentation to Congress of the United States Declaration of Independence less than three months later. ==Background== The creation and ratification of the resolves was the result of a strong movement in the colonies advocating separation from Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain.  These separatists, or "Patriot (American Revolution)|American Whigs" (later, "Patriots"), sought to mobilize public support for a much discussed and all encompassing declaration of independence.; April 2007 news article; University of North Carolina Library; retrieved April 2013; "North Carolina State History" online; retrieved April 2013 The primary impediment to an outright declaration of independence from Great Britain was that none of the delegates to the Second Continental Congress were authorized by their home governments to take any action that would lead to such a declaration. Advocates of independence therefore sought to revise the instructions to each congressional delegation and remove any restrictions regarding a declaration of independence. ==History== The resolution of April 12, 1776, became known as the Halifax Resolves because the North Carolina Provincial Congress|Fourth Provincial Congress of North Carolina adopted them while meeting in the town of Halifax, North Carolina. The 83 delegates present unanimously adopted the resolves, which encouraged delegates to the Continental Congress from all the colonies to finally push for independence. The adoption of the Halifax Resolves was the first official action in the colonies calling for independence from Great Britain., from "North Carolina Manual", 2012; Kelly Agan, Government & Heritage Library, 2017 ==Drive to independence== The Halifax Resolves only empowered North Carolina's three delegates to the Second Continental Congress (Joseph Hewes, William Hooper, and John Penn (delegate)|John Penn) to join with those from other colonies to declare independence from Great Britain's rule. With the passage of the resolves, North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly permit their delegates to vote in favor of independence.; article at "Learn NC" online; retrieved December 15, 2012 The Halifax Resolves, however, stopped short of instructing North Carolina's delegates to introduce a resolution of independence to Congress, a step which was taken by Colony of Virginia|Virginia in June with the adoption of the Lee ResolutionNote: The Lee Resolution was adopted at the Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Provincial Convention of June 7, 1776. The Second Continental Congress issued the United States Declaration of Independence the following month, in July.<!-- akin to "Paris is the capital of France" .. who doesn't know that US Independence Day is July 4?--> ==Legacy== Every year, on April 12, the Halifax Historic District, a historic site operated by the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, celebrates Halifax Day.
