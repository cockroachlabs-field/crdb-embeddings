The airline acquired several DC-3s throughout the 1980s. The airline was established by Joe Sparling and Tom Woods, and started flight training and general purpose charter operations in 1977 with a single Cessna 206. Throughout the 1980s the company steadily grew and acquired several more aircraft including Douglas DC-3s, a Douglas DC-4, and a variety of Cessnas, de Havilland Canada|de Havillands and other aircraft. Also during the 1980s Air North began offering scheduled passenger and cargo service in addition to charter services. During the 1990s the fleet of piston-powered aircraft were replaced with more modern and reliable turboprop aircraft, and by 2000 the fleet consisted of one Beechcraft Model 99 and three Hawker Siddeley HS 748|Hawker Siddeley 748 Series 2As. The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow also began investing in Air North around this time, and with help from this investment Air North acquired a pair of Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200 jets in 2002. These jets allowed Air North to begin competing with the mainline carriers between Yukon and Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. These routes proved to be successful and since then Kelowna, Yellowknife, Ottawa , Toronto, and Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria have also been added to Air North's route map. Since Air North began scheduled jet service on Yukon-South routes passenger traffic at the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport has doubled, and by 2014 nearly 60% of those passengers were flying with Air North. The Beech 99 was sold in 2005, a fourth Hawker Siddeley 748 acquired in 2006, and in 2008 a Boeing 737-200 Combi aircraft|combi was acquired, with its large main deck cargo door and moveable bulkhead allowing all-cargo as well as mixed cargo/passenger operations with the Boeing 737|737. Soon a gravel kit was also installed on the 737 Combi, allowing the aircraft to operate on the airline's northern routes.

Starting in 2010 a new fleet expansion and modernization plan was put into action, beginning with a larger Boeing 737 Classic|B737-400 and a Wingtip device|winglet-equipped B737-500. In 2012 a fifth HS748 (a pure freighter equipped with the large freight door) and a second 737-500 were acquired. 2014 saw the arrival of the third 737-500 sporting an updated livery, and a fourth 737-500 was put into service in 2016. In spring of 2017 two ATR 42 combi aircraft were introduced to the fleet and put to work on the northern routes, bringing an end to the world's last scheduled passenger HS-748 service. Two HS-748s remained in service through 2020 for freight and charters, however these have also now been replaced with additional ATR-42s.  With the newer aircraft in service the three 737-200s and five HS-748s were eventually either retired or sold. Some are now parked behind Air North's maintenance base and used for spare parts and staff training.
