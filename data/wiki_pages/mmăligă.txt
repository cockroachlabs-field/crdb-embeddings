Poles in Ukraine|Poles from the Lviv|Lviv area also prepare this traditional dish. It is also a traditional dish in Thessaly and Fthiotis, Greece, and is also common in the Black Sea region of Turkey. In Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, and many other countries, this dish is known as polenta. == History == Historically a peasant food, it was often used as a substitute for bread or even as a staple food in the poor rural areas. However, in the last decades it has emerged as an upscale dish available in the finest restaurants.  Historically, porridge is the oldest form of consumption of grains in the whole of humanity, long before the appearance of bread. Originally, the seeds used to prepare slurries were very diverse as millet or einkorn. Before the introduction of maize in Europe in the 16th century, mămăligă had been made with millet flour, known to the Romans as "pulmentum".  Maize was introduced into Spain by Hernán Cortés from Mexico in 1530 and spread in Europe in the 16th century. Maize (called "corn" in the United States) requires a good amount of heat and humidity. The Danube Valley is one of Europe's regions ideal for growing maize. A Hungarian scholar documented the arrival of corn in Timișoara, Banat region, 1692. In Transylvania, maize is also called 'cucuruz', which could imply a connection between Transylvanian and Serbian merchants, kukuruz being a Slavs|Slavic word. Some assume it was either Șerban Cantacuzino  or Constantin Mavrocordat who introduced corn in Wallachia, Maria Theresa in Transylvania  and Constantine Ducas (Moldavian ruler)|Constantine Ducas in Moldavia where it is called păpușoi. Mămăligă of millet would have been replaced gradually by mămăligă made of corn. The corn then become an important food, especially in the fight against famine which prevailed in the 17th and 18th centuries. Historian Nicolae Iorga noted that farmers of the Romanian Principalities had grown corn since the early-to-mid-17th century. Etienne Ignace Raicevich, a Republic of Ragusa Ragusan consul of the Napoleonic Empire to Bucharest in the third quarter of the 18th century, wrote that corn was introduced only "da poco tempo" (recently). In an edition of Éditions Larousse|Larousse, the French dictionary, in the Danubian principalities, the existence of corn-based mămăligă dates from 1873.  mamaligma s. f. Boiled corn meal. == Preparation == File:MamaligaBranza.JPG|thumb|right|Mămăligă with sour cream and cheese Traditionally, "mămăligă" is cooked by boiling water, salt and cornmeal in a special-shaped cast iron pot called "ceaun" or "tuci". When cooked peasant-style and used as a bread substitute, "mămăligă" is supposed to be much thicker than the regular Italian polenta to the point that it can be cut in slices, like bread. When cooked for other purposes, "mămăligă" can be much softer, sometimes almost to the consistency of porridge. Because "mămăligă" sticks to metal surfaces, a piece of sewing thread is used to cut it into slices instead of a knife; it can then be eaten by holding it with the hand, just like bread. "Mămăligă" is a versatile food: various recipes of "mămăligă"-based dishes may include milk, butter, various types of cheese, eggs, sausages (usually fried, grilled or oven-roasted), bacon, mushrooms, ham, fish etc. "Mămăligă" is a fat-free, cholesterol-free, high-fiber food. It can be used as a healthy alternative to more refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta or hulled rice.  "Mămăligă" is often served with sour cream and cheese on the side ("mămăligă cu brânză și smântână") or crushed in a bowl of hot milk ("mămăligă cu lapte"). Sometimes slices of "mămăligă" are pan-fried in oil or in lard, the result being a sort of corn pone. Also, the traditional meal is served with meat, usually pork called "tocana" or fried fish, and mujdei, a garlic-and-oil sauce.  Since "mămăligă" can be used as an alternative for bread in many Romanian cuisine|Romanian and Moldovan cuisine|Moldovan dishes, there are quite a few which are either based on "mămăligă", or include it as an ingredient or side dish. Arguably, the most popular of them is sarma (food)|sarmale (a type of cabbage roll)/grapevine roll) with "mămăligă". Another very popular Romanian dish based on "mămăligă" is called bulz (food)|bulz, and consists of "mămăligă" with cheese and butter and roasted in the oven. File:Mamaliga bucatarie moldoveneasca.jpg|thumb|Mămăligă Balmoș (sometimes spelled balmuș) is another "mămăligă"-like traditional Romanian dish, but is more elaborate. Unlike "mămăligă" (where the cornmeal is boiled in water) when making "balmoș" the cornmeal must be boiled in sheep milk. Other ingredients, such as butter, sour cream, "telemea" (a type of feta cheese), "caș" (a type of fresh curdled ewe cheese without whey, which is sometimes called "green cheese" in English), "urda cheese|urdă" (similar to ricotta), etc., are added to the mixture at certain times during the cooking process. It is a specialty dish of old Romanian shepherds, and nowadays very few people still know how to make a proper "balmoș". == Trivia == * A gruel made of cornmeal, water, milk, butter, salt and sugar is called in Romanian "cir de mămăligă". If it is exceedingly thin and made only of cornmeal, water and salt it is called "mieșniță" or "terci". * Depending on the context, "mălai" is the Romanian word for either: ** The Romanian version of cornmeal ** Any type of cereals or edible grains (much like the English maize|corn), but this use of the word is becoming increasingly obsolete ** Money, as a slang term. * Cornstarch|Corn flour (i.e., maize flour) is called in Romanian "mălai" or "făină de porumb". * Before the arrival of maize in Eastern Europe, "mămăligă" was made of millet flour. Long lost, millet "mămăligă" is now again fashionable in western Europe. * Mămăligă is mentioned multiple times in Aaron Lebedeff's Yiddish novelty song "Rumania, Rumania". In Yiddish it is spelled מאַמאַליגע. == In literature == In Chapter One of "Dracula" by Bram Stoker is the commentary, "I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was ‘mamaliga’, and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call ‘impletata’”. == Similar dishes == Mămăligă is similar to the Italian cuisine|Italian "polenta", which is also very popular in Brazil. Mush (cornmeal)|Cornmeal mush is its analogue common in some regions of the United States and grits in the southern regions. Its analogue in Serbia and Bulgaria is called kačamak (, ) and is served mainly with white Brined cheese|brine cheese or pork rind (fried pieces of pork fat with parts of the skin). In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia (also "polenta" or "palenta"), Serbia (also "kačamak") and in Montenegro the dish is mainly called "pura". In North Macedonia it is called "bakrdan" ()  and in Slovenia "polenta". Hungarians|Hungarians call it "puliszka". The Transylvanian Saxons call it 'palukes' in Transylvanian Saxon cuisine|their traditional cuisine. In Turkey it is also called mamaliga, or kaçamak. Another similar dish, called "kuymak" or "muhlama", is among the typical dishes of the Black Sea Region, although now popular in all the greater cities where there are many regional restaurants. Broccoliga is a variant of Mămăligă featuring a broccoli-polenta mixture suffused with cheddar cheese and herbs. Known by different names in local languages ( "abysta",  "mamrys",  "ghomi",  "zhuran-khudar", Chechen language|Chechen: "ah'ar-hudar/zhuran-hudar", Nogai language|Nogai: мамырза "mamyrza",   "sera"), it is also widespread in Caucasian cuisines. There is also a distinct similarity to "cou-cou" (as it is known in the Barbados), or "fungi" (as it is known in Antigua and Barbuda and other Leeward Islands in the Caribbean Sea).
