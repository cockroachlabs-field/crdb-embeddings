Sonny Barger, Darwin Holmstrom. HarperCollins, 8 Jun 2010Superbikes: The World's Top Performance Machines. Alan Dowds. Tangerine Press, 2004Cycle world, Volume 44. CBS Publications, 2005 is a three-cylinder reciprocating engine|piston engine where cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft. Less common than inline-four engine|straight-four engines, straight-three engines have nonetheless been used in various motorcycles, cars and agricultural machinery. == Design == File:Reihenmotor Drei Zylinder.gif|thumb|four stroke Straight-three engine with firing order 1-3-2 A crankshaft angle of 120 degrees is typically used by straight-three engines, since this results in an evenly spaced Firing_order#Firing_interval|firing interval. Another benefit of this configuration is perfect Engine_balance#Primary_balance|primary balance and Engine_balance#Secondary_balance|secondary balance, however an end-to-end Couple (mechanics)|rocking couple is induced because there is no symmetry in the piston velocities about the middle piston. A balance shaft is sometimes used to reduce the vibrations caused by the rocking couple. Other crankshaft angles have been used occasionally. The 1976-1981 Laverda Jota motorcycle used a 180 degree crankshaft, where the outer pistons rise and fall together and inner cylinder is offset from them by 180 degrees. This results in three power strokes evenly-spaced at 180 degrees each, and then no power strokes during the final 180 degrees of crankshaft rotation. The 2020 Triumph_Tiger|Triumph Tiger 900 motorcycle uses a "T-Plane" crankshaft where the crankshaft throws are at 90 intervals, such that the throws for cylinders 1 and 3 are separated by 180 degrees (therefore the three throws together forming a "T" shape when viewed from the end). == Usage in cars == File:Tuned-SAAB-twostroke.jpg|thumb|Circa-1960 Saab two-stroke engine File:Suzuki K10B.JPG|thumb|2010 List of Suzuki engines#K engine|Suzuki K10B engine Among the first cars to use a straight-three engine is the 1953-1955 DKW#Automobiles made after 1945|DKW F91, powered by a  two-stroke engine. The 1956-1960 Saab 93 saw the introduction of Saab's  two-stroke engine, which was also used in the Saab 95, Saab 96 and Saab Sonett until 1968 after which it was replace by the Ford Taunus V4 engine. The Wartburg (car)|Wartburg cars (manufactured in East Germany) and FSO Syrena (manufactured in Poland) also used straight-three engines. The 1967 Suzuki Fronte#Fronte 360|Suzuki Fronte 360 uses a  two-stroke engine. In 1980, Suzuki began production of a  four-stroke engine, which was introduced in the Alto and Fronte models. The Subaru EF engine is a 4-stroke petrol engine which was introduced in 1984 and used in the Subaru Justy|Justy and the Subaru Sumo|Sumo (the export version of the Sambar). The straight-three versions of the Ford EcoBoost engine - a turbocharged 1.0-litre petrol engine - was introduced in the 2012 Ford Focus. It uses an unbalanced flywheel to shift the inherent three-cylinder imbalance to the horizontal plane where it is more easily managed by engine mounts, and so remove the need to use balance shafts. In 2016, cylinder deactivation was added, claimed to be a world first for three-cylinder engines. {| class="wikitable sortable" |+ Other car engines |- ! Years !! Name !! Fuel!!
