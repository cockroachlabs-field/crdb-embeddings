In mathematics, a Lie algebroid is a vector bundle <math>A \rightarrow M</math> together with a Lie bracket on its space of Section (fiber bundle)|sections <math>\Gamma(A)</math> and a vector bundle morphism <math>\rho: A \rightarrow TM</math>, satisfying a Leibniz rule. A Lie algebroid can thus be thought of as a "many-object generalisation" of a Lie algebra. Lie algebroids play a similar same role in the theory of Lie groupoids that Lie algebras play in the theory of Lie groups: reducing global problems to infinitesimal ones. Indeed, any Lie groupoid gives rise to a Lie algebroid, which is the vertical bundle of the source map restricted at the units. However, unlike Lie algebras, not every Lie algebroid arises from a Lie groupoid. Lie algebroids were introduced in 1967 by Jean Pradines. ==Definition and basic concepts== A "Lie algebroid" is a triple <math>(A, , \rho)</math> consisting of * a vector bundle <math>A</math> over a manifold <math>M</math> * a Lie algebra#Definition and first properties|Lie bracket <math></math> on its space of sections <math>\Gamma (A)</math> * a morphism of vector bundles <math>\rho: A\rightarrow TM</math>, called the "anchor", where <math>TM</math> is the tangent bundle of <math>M</math> such that the anchor and the bracket satisfy the following Leibniz rule: :<math>=\rho(X)f\cdot Y + f</math> where <math>X,Y \in \Gamma(A), f\in C^\infty(M)</math> and <math>\rho(X)f</math> is the derivative of <math>f</math> along the vector field <math>\rho(X)</math>. One often writes "<math>A \to M</math>" when the bracket and the anchor are clear from the context; some authors denote Lie algebroids by "<math>A \Rightarrow M</math>", suggesting a "limit" of a Lie groupoids when the arrows denoting source and target become "infinitesimally close".  It follows from the definition that * for every <math>x \in M</math>, the kernel <math>\mathfrak{g}_x(A)=\ker(\rho_x)</math> is a Lie algebra, called the "isotropy Lie algebra" at <math>x</math> *the kernel <math>\mathfrak{g}(A)=\ker(\rho)</math> is a (not necessarily locally trivial) bundle of Lie algebras, called the "isotropy Lie algebra bundle" * the image <math>\mathrm{Im}(\rho) \subseteq TM</math> is a Singular distribution (differential geometry)|singular distribution which is integrable, i.e. its admits maximal immersed submanifolds <math>\mathcal O \subseteq M</math>, called the "orbits", satisfying <math>\mathrm{Im}(\rho_x) = T_x \mathcal{O}</math> for every <math>x \in \mathcal O</math>. Equivalently, orbits can be explicitly described as the sets of points which are joined by "A-paths", i.e. pairs <math>(a: I \to A, \gamma: I \to M)</math> of paths in <math>A</math> and in <math>M</math> such that <math>a(t) \in A_{\gamma(t)}</math> and <math>\rho (a(t)) = \gamma'(t)</math> * the anchor map <math>\rho</math> descends to a map between sections <math>\rho: \Gamma(A) \rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(M)</math> which is a Lie algebra morphism, i.e. :<math>\rho()= </math> for all <math>X,Y \in \Gamma(A)</math>. The property that <math>\rho</math> induces a Lie algebra morphism was taken as an axiom in the original definition of Lie algebroid. Such redundancy, despite being known from an algebraic point of view already before Pradine's definition, was noticed only much later.  A "Lie subalgebroid" of a Lie algebroid <math>(A, , \rho)</math> is a vector subbundle <math>A'\to M'</math> of the restriction <math>A_{\mid M'} \to M'</math> such that <math>\rho_{\mid A'}</math> takes values in <math>TM'</math> and <math>\Gamma(A,A'):= \{ \alpha \in \Gamma(A) \mid \alpha_{\mid M'} \in \Gamma(A') \}</math> is a Lie subalgebra of <math>\Gamma(A)</math>. Clearly, <math>A'\to M'</math> admits a unique Lie algebroid structure such that <math>\Gamma(A,A') \to \Gamma(A')</math> is a Lie algebra morphism. With the language introduced below, the inclusion <math>A' \hookrightarrow A</math> is a Lie algebroid morphism. A Lie subalgebroid is called "wide" if <math>M' = M</math>. In analogy to the standard definition for Lie algebra, an "ideal" of a Lie algebroid is wide Lie subalgebroid <math>I \subseteq A</math> such that <math>\Gamma(I) \subseteq \Gamma(A)</math> is a Lie ideal. Such notion proved to be very restrictive, since <math>I</math> is forced to be inside the isotropy bundle <math>\ker(\rho)</math>. For this reason, the more flexible notion of "infinitesimal ideal system" has been introduced.  A "Lie algebroid morphism" between two Lie algebroids <math>(A_1, _{A_1}, \rho_1)</math> and <math>(A_2, _{A_2}, \rho_2)</math> with the same base <math>M</math> is a vector bundle morphism <math>\phi: A_1 \to A_2</math> which is compatible with the Lie brackets, i.e. <math>\phi (_{A_1}) = _{A_2}</math> for every <math>\alpha,\beta \in \Gamma(A_1)</math>, and with the anchors, i.e. <math>\rho_2 \circ \phi = \rho_1</math>. A similar notion can be formulated for morphisms with different bases, but the compatibility with the Lie brackets becomes more involved. Equivalently, one can ask that the graph of <math>\phi: A_1 \to A_2</math> to be a subalgebroid of the direct product <math>A_1 \times A_2</math> (introduced below).Eckhard Meinrenken, , Lecture notes, fall 2017 Lie algebroids together with their morphisms form a Category (mathematics)|category. == Examples ==  * Given any manifold <math>M</math>, its "tangent Lie algebroid" is the tangent bundle <math>TM \to M</math> together with the Lie bracket of vector fields and the identity of <math>TM</math> as an anchor. *Given any manifold <math>M</math>, the zero vector bundle <math>M \times 0 \to M</math> is a Lie algebroid with zero bracket and anchor. *Lie algebroids <math>A \to \{*\}</math> over a point are the same thing as Lie algebras. * More generally, any bundles of Lie algebras is Lie algebroid with zero anchor and Lie bracket defined pointwise.  * Given a foliation <math>\mathcal{F}</math> on <math>M</math>, its "foliation algebroid" is the associated involutive subbundle <math>\mathcal{F} \subseteq TM</math>, with brackets and anchor induced from the tangent Lie algebroid. * Given the action of a Lie algebra "<math>\mathfrak{g}</math>" on a manifold <math>M</math>, its "action algebroid" is the trivial vector bundle <math>\mathfrak{g} \times M \to M</math>, with anchor given by the Lie algebra action and brackets uniquely determined by the bracket of <math>\mathfrak{g}</math> on constant sections <math>M \to \mathfrak{g}</math> and by the Leibniz identity. *Given a principal bundle|principal "G"-bundle "<math>P</math>" over a manifold "<math>M</math>", its "Atiyah algebroid" is the Lie algebroid <math>A = TP/G</math> fitting in the following short exact sequence: *:<math> 0 \to \ker(\rho) \to TP/G\xrightarrow{\rho} TM \to 0.</math> : The space of sections of the Atiyah algebroid is the Lie algebra of "<math>G</math>"-invariant vector fields on "<math>P</math>", its isotropy Lie algebra bundle is isomorphic to the Adjoint bundle|adjoint vector bundle <math>P\times_G \mathfrak g</math>, and the right splittings of the sequence above are principal connections on "<math>P</math>." *Given a vector bundle <math>E \to M</math>, its "general linear algebroid", denoted by "<math>\mathfrak{gl}(E)</math>" or "<math>\mathrm{Der}(E)</math>", is the vector bundle whose sections are derivations of <math>E</math>, i.e. first-order differential operators <math>\Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E)</math> admitting a vector field <math>\rho(D) \in \mathfrak{X}(M)</math> such that <math>D(f \sigma) = f D(\sigma) + \rho(D)(f) \sigma</math> for every <math>f \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M), \sigma \in \Gamma(E)</math>. The anchor is simply the assignment <math>D \mapsto \rho(D)</math> and the Lie bracket is given by the commutator of differential operators. *Given a Poisson manifold "<math>(M,\pi)</math>", its "cotangent algebroid" is the cotangent vector bundle "<math>A = T^*M</math>", with Lie bracket "<math>:= \mathcal{L}_{\pi^\sharp (\alpha)} (\beta) - \mathcal{L}_{\pi^\sharp (\beta)} (\alpha) - d \pi( \alpha, \beta)</math>" and anchor map "<math>\pi^\sharp: T^*M \to TM, \alpha \mapsto \pi(\alpha,\cdot)</math>". *Given a closed 2-form <math>\omega \in \Omega^2(M)</math>, the vector bundle "<math>A_\omega := TM \times \mathbb{R} \to M</math>" is a Lie algebroid with anchor the projection on the first component and Lie bracket"<math display="block">:= \Big( , \mathcal{L}_X(g) - \mathcal{L}_Y(f) - \omega(X,Y) \Big).</math>"Actually, the bracket above can be defined for any 2-form <math>\omega</math>, but <math>A_\omega</math> is a Lie algebroid if and only if <math>\omega</math> is closed.  * Given any Lie algebroid <math>(A \to M,,\rho)</math>, there is a Lie algebroid <math>(TA \to TM,,\rho)</math>, called its "tangent algebroid", obtained by considering the tangent bundle of <math>A</math> and <math>M</math> and the Pushforward (differential)|differential of the anchor. * Given any Lie algebroid <math>(A \to M,_A,\rho_A)</math>, there is a Lie algebroid <math>(J^k A \to M,,\rho)</math>, called its "k-jet algebroid", obtained by considering the Jet bundle|k-jet bundle of <math>A \to M</math>, with Lie bracket uniquely defined by <math> := j^k _A</math> and anchor <math>\rho(j^k_x\alpha):= \rho_A(\alpha(x) )</math>. *Given two Lie algebroids <math>A_1 \to M_1</math> and <math>A_2 \to M_2</math>, their "direct product" is the unique Lie algebroid <math>A_1 \times A_2 \to M_1 \times M_2</math> with anchor <math>(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \mapsto \rho_1(\alpha_1) \oplus \rho_2 (\alpha_2) \in TM_1 \oplus TM_2 \cong T(M_1 \times M_2), </math> and such that <math>\Gamma(A_1) \oplus \Gamma(A_2) \to \Gamma(A_1 \times A_2), \alpha_1 \oplus \alpha_2 \mapsto \mathrm{pr}_{M_1}^*\alpha_1 + \mathrm{pr}_{M_2}^*\alpha_2</math> is a Lie algebra morphism. *Given a Lie algebroid <math>(A \to M,_A,\rho_A)</math> and a map <math>f: M' \to M</math> whose Pushforward (differential)|differential is Transversality (mathematics)|transverse to the anchor map <math>\rho: A \to TM</math> (for instance, it is enough for <math>f</math> to be a Surjective function|surjective Submersion (mathematics)|submersion), the "pullback algebroid" is the unique Lie algebroid <math>f^!A \to M'</math>,  with <math>f^!A:=TM' \times_{TM} A \to M'</math> the pullback vector bundle, and <math>\rho_{f^!A}: f^!A \to TM'</math> the projection on the first component, such that <math>f^!A \to A</math> is a Lie algebroid morphism. == Important classes of Lie algebroids ==  A Lie algebroid is called "totally intransitive" if the anchor map <math>\rho: A \to TM</math> is zero. Bundle of Lie algebras (hence also Lie algebras) are totally intransitive. This actually exhaust completely the list of totally intransitive Lie algebroids: indeed, if <math>A</math> is totally intransitive, it must coincide with its isotropy Lie algebra bundle.  A Lie algebroid is called "transitive" if the anchor map <math>\rho: A \to TM</math> is surjective. As a consequence: * there is a short exact sequence<math display="block"> 0 \to \ker(\rho) \to A \xrightarrow{\rho} TM \to 0;</math> * right-splitting of <math>\rho</math> defines a principal bundle connections on <math>\ker(\rho)</math>; * the isotropy bundle <math>\ker(\rho)</math> is locally trivial (as bundle of Lie algebras); * the pullback of <math>A</math> exist for every <math>f: M' \to M</math>. The prototypical examples of transitive Lie algebroids are Atiyah algebroids. For instance: * tangent algebroids <math>TM</math> are trivially transitive (indeed, they are Atiyah algebroid of the principal <math>\{e\}</math>-bundle <math>M \to M</math>) * Lie al ...
