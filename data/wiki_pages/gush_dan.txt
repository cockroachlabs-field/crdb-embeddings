"Dan bloc") or "Tel Aviv metropolitan area" () is a conurbation in Israel, located along Israeli coastal plain|the country's Mediterranean coastline. There is no single formal definition of Gush Dan, though the term is in frequent use by both governmental bodies and the general public. It ranges from combining Tel Aviv with cities that form urban continuum with it, to the entire areas from both the Tel Aviv District|Tel Aviv and the Central District (Israel)|Central District, or sometimes the whole Metropolitan Area of Tel Aviv. which includes a small part of the Southern District (Israel)|Southern District as well. Gush Dan is the largest conurbation and metropolitan area in Israel, with the metropolitan area having an estimated population of 4,054,570 residents, 95% of whom are Israeli Jews. ==Cities in Gush Dan== Population in cities as of the end of 2018:  ;Over 400,000 *Tel Aviv-Yafo  ;Over 200,000 *Rishon LeZion  *Petah Tikva  *Ashdod  *Netanya  *Bnei Brak  ;Over 100,000 *Holon  *Ramat Gan  *Ashkelon  *Rehovot  *Bat Yam  *Herzliya  *Kfar Saba  ;Over 50,000 *Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut  *Ramla  *Lod  *Ra'anana  *Givatayim  *Hod HaSharon 61,102 *Rosh HaAyin 50,453 ;Over 10,000 *Ness Ziona 49,108 *Ramat HaSharon 46,019 *El'ad 46.896 *Yavne 45,453 *Kiryat Ono *Yehud-Monosson *Tira, Israel|Tira *Giv'at Shmuel *Kafr Qasim *Qalansawe *Be'er Ya'akov *Even Yehuda *Gan Yavne *Ganei Tikva *Gedera *Giv'at Shmuel *Jaljulia *Kadima-Zoran *Kfar Yona *Kiryat Ekron *Kokhav Ya'ir *Mazkeret Batya *Shoham *Tel Mond  <gallery> File:Gush Dan.png|Map of the Gush Dan File:Location telaviv.png|Map of inner metropolitan area File:Tel Aviv SPOT 1083.jpg|Satellite Image of the Inner Ring of the Gush Dan File:Tel Aviv Area at Night (ISS026-E-28912).jpg|NASA photo of Tel Aviv area at night </gallery> ==Metropolitan rings== Israel Central Bureau of Statistics divides the Tel Aviv metropolitan area into four: {|class="wikitable" |+<big>Metropolitan rings in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area</big> |- ! bgcolor="#efefef" rowspan="2" | "Metropolitan ring" ! bgcolor="#efefef" rowspan="2" | "Localities" ! bgcolor="#efefef" colspan="4" | "Population (EOY 2018 estimate)" ! bgcolor="#efefef" rowspan="2" | "Population density<br />(per km²)" ! bgcolor="#efefef" rowspan="2" | "Annual Population<br />growth rate" |- ! bgcolor="#efefef" | Total ! bgcolor="#efefef" | Israeli Jews|Jews and others<sup>1</sup> ! bgcolor="#efefef" | Thereof: Israeli Jews|Jews ! bgcolor="#efefef" | Arab citizens of Israel|Arabs |- | <big>Core</big><sup>2</sup> | <big>1</big> | <big>451,500</big> | <big>431,100</big> | <big>407,200</big> | <big>20,400</big> | <big>8,718.6</big> | <big>1.7%</big> |- | <big>Inner Ring</big><sup>3</sup> | <big>13</big> | <big>975,600</big> | <big>973,700</big> | <big>911,900</big> | <big>2,000</big> | <big>8,097</big> | <big>1.4%</big> |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Section | 4 | 144,300 | 144,100 | 138,800 | 200 | 3,327.4 | 1.3% |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Eastern Section | 5 | 495,100 | 494,400 | 479,600 | 700 | 12,394.3 | 1.9% |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Section | 4 | 336,300 | 335,200 | 293,500 | 1,100 | 9,042.2 | 0.6% |- | <big>Middle Ring</big><sup>4</sup> | <big>31</big>  | <big>1,219,800</big> | <big>1,177,300</big> | <big>1,108,100</big> | <big>42,500</big> | <big>4,157.4</big> | <big>1.6%</big> |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Section | 6 | 239,500 | 239,200 | 232,300 | 300 | 4,567.4 | 1.3% |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Eastern Section | 8 | 325,700 | 325,300 | 304,400 | 400 | 4,558.6 | 1.7% |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Section | 17 | 654,500 | 612,800 | 571,500 | 41,800 | 3,861.5 | 1.7% |- | <big>Outer Ring</big><sup>5</sup> | <big>258</big> | <big>1,338,000</big> | <big>1,200,200</big> | <big>1,140,700</big> | <big>137,800</big> | <big>1,052.9</big> | <big>2%</big> |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Section | 97 | 497,100 | 397,300 | 375,100 | 99,800 | 1,284.9 | 1.3% |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Eastern Section | 47 | 294,700 | 258,000 | 254,200 | 36,700 | 1,056.4 | 3.3% |- | &nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Section | 91 | 453,300 | 452,600 | 424,200 | 700 | 877.3 | 1.4% |- |"Judea And Samaria Section"<sup>6</sup> |23 |93,000 |92,300 |87,200 |600 | - |4.3% |- | <big>"Total"</big> | <big>"303"</big> | <big>"3,984,900"</big> | <big>"3,782,300"</big> | <big>"3,567,900"</big> | <big>"202,700"</big> | <big>"2,361.4"</big> | <big>"1.7%"</big> |}  The statistic does not however include the Palestinian localities located East of the Green Line (Israel)|Green Line. }} ==History==  |1946 |343000 |1956 |845000 |1966 |1291000 |1976 |1661000 |1986 |2036000 |1996 |2547000 |2006 |3098000 |2016 |3854000 |refnote=2017 datahttp://www.cbs.gov.il/ts/ID98991f858e0e0c/ }} The name "Gush Dan" means "Dan Bloc", and is so named because the area was the territory of the tribe of Dan in the ancient Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel. According to the biblical narrative, the tribe had originally tried to settle in the central coastal area of Canaan, but due to enmity with the Philistines who had already settled there, were only able to camp in the hill country overlooking the Sorek Valley. The camp location became known as Mahaneh Dan ("Camps of Dan"). The region they attempted to settle included the area as far north as Jaffa|Joppa and as far south as Shephelah in the area of Timnah. As a result of the pressure from the Philistines, the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast, instead migrating to the north of the country. After conquering Laish, the tribe refounded it as their capital and renamed it Tel Dan|Dan. In remembrance of the original territory assignments, this coastal region is referred to as Gush Dan. The modern city of Tel Aviv was founded in 1909 as a suburb of the Arab majority coastal city of Jaffa. The city grew rapidly in the ensuing decades thanks to Jewish immigration from Europe, with the population reaching 150,000 in 1934, and 230,000 14 years later when Israel gained its independence. Before the establishment of the state, other towns in the Gush Dan were founded as well, such as Petah Tikva in 1878, Rishon LeZion in 1882, Ness Ziona in 1883, Rehovot in 1890, and the majority of other Gush Dan cities were established before 1948. In 1947, the Jewish population of the Gush Dan was nearly 400,000, comprising the majority of the Jewish population of Mandate Palestine. As such almost all of it was included in the Jewish state proposed by the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Arab population of the region, which had been nearly 150,000 before the war, was reduced to around 10,000. They were quickly replaced by a larger number of Jews fleeing from postwar Europe and persecution in Arab countries. However, at this time many new immigrants did not come to Tel Aviv. In the 1950s towns were built on the edges of the Gush Dan, including Ashdod, Rosh HaAyin and Yavne. The nation's sole port at t ...
