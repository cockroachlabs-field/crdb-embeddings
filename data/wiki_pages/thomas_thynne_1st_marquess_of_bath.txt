He served as Southern Secretary, Northern Secretary and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1751 and 1789, he was known as the 3rd Viscount Weymouth. He is possibly best known for his role in the Falklands Crisis (1770)|Falklands Crisis of 1770. ==Early life== He was born on 13 September 1734, the eldest son and heir of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth (1710–1751) by his wife Louisa Thynne, Viscountess Weymouth|Louisa Carteret (c.&nbsp;1712–1736), a daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 2nd Baron Carteret (1690–1763). On her father's side, she was a great-granddaughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701), and her father's first-cousin was William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692–1711), on whose death the Earl of Bath|Earldom of Bath became extinct.  The Thynnes are descended from Sir John Thynne (c.&nbsp;1515–1580), the builder of Longleat House, the family seat in Wiltshire, who acquired vast estates after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Sir John owed his wealth and position to the favour of his master, the Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset.'Parliamentary history : 1529–1629', in "A History of the County of Wiltshire", vol. 5 (1957), , accessed 7 July 2011 He was comptroller of the household of the future Queen Elizabeth I of England. Another famous ancestor was Thomas Thynne (died 1682)|Thomas Thynne (1648–1682), called on account of his wealth "Tom of Ten Thousand" and celebrated by John Dryden|Dryden as Issachar in "Absalom and Achitophel", who was murdered in London in February 1682. ==Career== He succeeded his father as 3rd Viscount Weymouth in January 1751 and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for a short time during 1765, although he never visited that country. Having become prominent in British politics, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department in January 1768 and acted with great promptitude during the unrest caused by John Wilkes and the Middlesex election of 1768. He was then attacked and libeled by Wilkes, who was consequently expelled from the British House of Commons|House of Commons.  Before the close of 1768, he was transferred from the Northern Department to become Secretary of State for the Southern Department, but he resigned in December 1770 in the midst of the "Falklands Crisis (1770)|Falklands Crisis", a dispute with Spain over the possession of the Falkland Islands.  In November 1775, Weymouth returned to his former office of Secretary of State for the Southern Department, undertaking in addition the duties attached to the northern department for a few months in 1779, but he resigned both positions in the autumn of that year. This period covered the American War of Independence. ==Later life== He was High Steward of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield from 1781 until his death in November 1796, having been created Marquess of Bath in 1789. The title of Earl of Bath that had been held by his Granville ancestor was then unavailable, as it had been recreated for a member of the Pulteney family. ==Marriage and issue== In 1759, he married Elizabeth Thynne, Marchioness of Bath|Lady Elizabeth Bentinck, daughter of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and the art collector Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, with whom he had three sons and four daughters, including: * Lady Henrietta Thynne (born 16 November 1762)"The Register of Births and Baptisms in the Parish of St James within the Liberty of Westminster. 1761-1786". 16 December 1762. *Lady Sophia Thynne (born 18 December 1763)"The Register of Births and Baptisms in the Parish of St James within the Liberty of Westminster. 1761-1786". 17 January 1764. *Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath (25 January 1765 – 27 March 1837), eldest son and heir."The Register of Births and Baptisms in the Parish of St James within the Liberty of Westminster. 1761-1786". 25 February 1765. * Lady Maria Thynne (born 1 August 1767, died March 1768)"The Register of Births and Baptisms in the Parish of St James within the Liberty of Westminster. 1761-1786". 29 August 1767.Buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly, on 31 March 1768.

His wife's family once owned the land on which the street was later built. ==References==  "Attribution:" *                         Catgeory:Thynne family|Thomas  Category:1734 births Category:1796 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:British Secretaries of State Category:Grooms of the Stool Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Lords Lieutenant of Ireland Category:Marquesses of Bath|1 Category:Members of the Privy Council of Great Britain Category:Leaders of the House of Lords Category:Court of George III of the United Kingdom
