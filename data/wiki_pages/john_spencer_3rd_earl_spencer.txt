He was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey and William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne from 1830 to 1834. Due to his reputation for integrity, he was nicknamed "Honest Jack". ==Early years== His father George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer had served in the ministries of William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger, Charles James Fox and William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville, and was First Lord of the Admiralty (1794–1801). George Spencer was married to the eldest daughter of Charles Bingham, 1st Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan. Their eldest son, John Charles, was born at Spencer House, London|Spencer House, London, on 30 May 1782. In 1800, after Harrow School|Harrow, he took up his residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, and for some time applied himself energetically to mathematical studies; but he spent most of his time in hunting and racing. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire on 5 June 1803. In 1804, he entered British House of Commons|parliament as a member for Okehampton in Devon. He vacated his seat in 1806, to contest the University of Cambridge against Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Henry Petty and Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston (when he was hopelessly beaten), but he was elected that same year for St Albans, and appointed a lord of the treasury. At the general election in November 1806, he was elected for Northamptonshire, and he continued to sit for the county until he succeeded to the peerage. For the next few years after this speech, Lord Althorp occasionally spoke in debates and was always on the side of Liberalism, but from 1813 to 1818 he was only rarely in the House of Commons. His absence was partly due to a feeling that it was hopeless to struggle against the will of the Tory ministry, but more particularly because of the death of his wife. ==Leader of the Commons== In 1819, on his return to political life, he pressed for establishing a more efficient Court of Bankruptcy|bankruptcy court, and of expediting the recovery of small debts; and he saw both these reforms accomplished before 1825. During the greater part of the reign of George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV, the British Whig Party|Whigs lost their influence in the state from their want of cohesion, but this defect was soon remedied in 1830 when Lord Althorp was chosen their leader in the lower house, and his capacity for the position was proved by experience. In Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey's government Althorp was both Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was instrumental in the success of the government measures. Along with John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell, he led the fight to pass the Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832, making more than twenty speeches, and is generally considered the architect of its victory. ==The Lords== After the dissolution of 1833, the Whig government had been slowly dying, and was further weakened by Althorp's promotion to the House of Lords following the death of his father in 1834. The new Lord Spencer abandoned the cares of office and returned to country life with unalloyed delight. Henceforth agriculture, not politics, was his principal interest. He was the first president of the Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society (founded 1838), and a notable cattle breeder. Though often urged by his political friends to come to their assistance, he rarely quit the peaceful pleasures which he loved. He died without issue at Wiseton on 1 October 1845, and was succeeded by his brother Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer|Frederick (d. 1857). ==Reputation and legacy== The Whigs required, to carry the Reform Bill, a leader above party spirit. "Honest Jack Althorp" has been called "the most decent man who ever held high Government office". Although he was not a particularly good public speaker, his integrity was an invaluable asset to the Government. Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge said that one of John Wilson Croker's speeches was demolished by the simple statement of Lord Althorp that he "had collected some figures which entirely refuted it, but had lost them." To Croker's credit, he replied that he would never doubt Althorp's word. Spencer Street in Melbourne, is named in his honour. ==Marriage== On 13 April 1814, Spencer married Esther Acklom (September 1788 – 11 June 1818) at Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London. Cokayne quotes from the Joseph Farington|Farington Diaries, "in marrying He complied with the wishes of Lord and Lady Spencer, it was not of His own seeking" and from the Letter Bag of Spencer-Stanhope family|Lady Elizabeth Spencer-Stanhope, "since Jack Althorp would not propose to her, she proposed to him; and such an unusual proceeding was fraught with happy consequences ... his devotion after marriage amply compensated for his lack of ardour before." Esther died on 11 June 1818 at the age of 29 at Halkin Street, Belgravia, London, England, in childbirth and she was buried on 18 June 1818 in Brington, Northamptonshire, England. John was said to be deeply upset by his wife's death and was devoted to her memory for the rest of his life: he resolved never to remarry, and it is said that he gave up hunting, his favourite pastime, to mark the depth of his loss. ==Coat of arms==  ==Ancestry==  ==References==   *T.C.
