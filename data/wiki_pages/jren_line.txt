The name is no longer in official use and the section is regarded as the  westernmost part of the Sørlandet Line. Owned by Bane NOR, the line has double track from Stavanger Station to Sandnes Station, and single track (rail)|single track from Sandnes to Egersund Station. The line is railway electrification system|electrified at  and equipped with centralized traffic control and GSM-R. The line is served by the Jæren Commuter Rail and intercity trains along the Sørlandet Line, both operated by Go-Ahead Norge. CargoNet runs container freight trains on the line, which terminate at Ganddal Freight Terminal. The line opened as a  narrow gauge stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from Egersund to Flekkefjord as the Flekkefjord Line in 1904. The Jæren Line's only branch, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård, opened in 1924. In 1944, the Sørlandet Line was extended to Sira, Norway|Sira on the Flekkefjord Line, and the Jæren Line was integrated in the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to standard gauge. ==Route== File:Jæren Line map.svg|thumb|left|Map of the Jæren Line and the Ålgård Line The Jæren Line constitutes the section of the Sørlandet Line between Stavanger and Egersund.Bjerke (1994): 194 At the time of the line's opening, it was  long,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 44 but has since the 1950s been  long.Bjerke (1994): 195 The railway is double track on the  section from Stavanger Station to Sandnes Station, and single track (rail)|single track from there to Egersund Station.

Southwards from Stavanger, the route largely runs along the waterfront, hugging Gandsfjorden. The first station after Stavanger is Paradis Station ( from Stavanger Station). The line runs past the closed Hillevåg Station and a closed spur to an industrial area at Mariero before reaching Mariero Station (). The line continues past the closed Lyngnes Station, a closed spur to Sørbø Trelast and the closed Vaulen Station. After passing the closed Hinna Station and the closed Jåttå Station, which was exclusively used to serve matches and concerts at Viking Stadion, the line immediately afterwards reaches Jåttåvågen Station (), which also serves the stadium and the newly redeveloped area of Jåtten. The line continues past Gausel Station (), which in addition to serving a redeveloped area serves as a major transfer hub for buses towards Forus and Sola, Norway|Sola. Next the line passes the closed Forus Station before running through the  long Lurahammer Tunnel and passing the closed Luravika Station and Lura Station. Through the town center of Sandnes, the line runs as an elevated railway, which previously also included a branch to the port in Sandnes. Sandnes Sentrum Station () is the main station serving the town. The line continues past Sandnes Station (), which is the end of the double track. After passing the closed Brualand Station and the open Ganddal Station (), the closed Ålgård Line branches off. Ganddal Freight Terminal is the only freight terminal in Jæren. It has an annual capacity for 80,000 containers and can handle  long trains. The next station on the mainline are the closed Skjæveland Station and Orstad Station, followed by the operating Øksnevadporten Station (). South of there lays to spurs, to Øksnevad, Kvarnaland and Block Watne. The line continues past the closed Engjelsvåg Station before reaching Klepp Station (). The line continues past the closed Leland Station and the closed Tumarki Station before having a closed spur to Varheia. After passing the closed Vardheia Station, the line reaches Bryne Station  (). Next the line passes a spur to Hetland and then passes four closed stations, Kjelsholen Station|Kjelsholen, Hognestad Station|Hognestad, Gjerdo Station|Gjerdo and Tårland Station|Tårland. After reaching Nærbø Station (), the line continues past the closed Kvia Station and the closed Dysjaland Station before reaching Varhaug Station (). Located at  AMSL, it is the highest-elevated station on the line. After passing the closed Odland Station, the line runs past the closed Stavnheim Station and reaches Vigrestad Station (). The line continues past the closed Hogstad Station and the closed Stokkaland Station before reaching Brusand Station (). Afterwards it crosses Vauleelva and then runs through the  long Varden Tunnel before passing the closed Varden Station and reaching Ogna Station ().Bjerke (1994): 200 At Ogna there is a distinct change to the landscape, as it changes from a flat to a hilly. Particularly between Bryne and Ogna, the line have a large curve radius, but between Ogna and Egersund this changes to much tighter curvature.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 31–35 After Ogna the line crosses Ognaelv and runs through the  long Sirevåg Tunnel before reaching Sirevåg Station  (). The line then runs through two tunnels before passing the closed Vatnamot Station and reaching Hellvik Station  (). The line continues through six tunnels, the longest being , before passing the closed Maurholen Station. It then passes through four more tunnels and two bridges before reaching Egersund Station  (). At Egersund, the line continues as the Sørlandet Line. Originally the Jæren Line ran to the old station in Egersund, which was kept until 1952 as a  branch from Egersund Station. This included bridges over Eieelva and Lundeelva.Bjerke (1994): 202 ==History== File:Railway and windmill at Nærbø.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow-gauged Jæren Line and a windmill at Hå in 1912  During the 19th century, transport along the Jæren coast was dominated by ship. Some simple roads had been built, but these were insufficient for quick and efficient transport. In the mid-19th century, the roads were improved, and ideas were launched to start a traction engine service along the coast. At an 1866 meeting at the sheriff's office in, Forest Manager Andreas Tanberg Gløersen launched the first idea of building a railway to connect Stavanger and Egersund. Gløersen had been to the Netherlands where he had taken and observed train operations. Later the same year, a meeting was held with representatives from the municipalities of Hå, Klepp and Time.Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 6 The meeting concluded that a railway should be built, and the responsibility for the preparatory work was given to County governor (Norway)|County Governor Vilhelm Ludvig Herman von Munthe af Morgenstierne. He started by conducting traffic counting throughout the district. This resulted in an estimate for a revenue of NOK&nbsp;215,000 and a cost of NOK&nbsp;153,000 per year.Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 7 Originally the proposal was to connect the various villages in Jæren together. But during planning, national authorities stated that the line would be part of a trans-national railway that would connect Rogaland to Eastern Norway. This resulted in the railway being planned with a straighter profile and running via fewer communities.Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 8 File:Jærbanen gjennom Hå 3.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow-gauged Jæren Line near Ogna in 1908 The proposal was sent to the Ministry of the Interior (Norway)|Ministry of the Interior, who recommended the line and presented it to Parliament of Norway|Parliament on 6 May 1874.Bergsgård (1964): 208 Parliament passed legislation to build the line on 3 June 1874. During the celebrations in Stavanger that evening, a gunner lost his hand following the explosion of a cannon. Particularly in Sandnes the choice of route resulted in much debate. Parliament had in its proposal for the line stipulated that the railway should have good port access in Sandnes.Eggebø (1996): 28 The "Blue Line" proposal ran along the waterfront, but would require two different stations in Sandnes. The "Red Line" proposal ran midway through the town center, splitting it in two. However, it gave only a single station, and was eventually chosen, after the municipal council initially had su ...
