It is located on the border of the Negev and the Judaean Desert|Judean Deserts,  west of the Dead Sea and  east of Beersheba. The city is home to a diverse population of , including Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, both secular and religious, Negev Bedouin|Bedouins and Black Hebrew Israelites|Black Hebrews, as well as new immigrants. After attempts to settle the area in the 1920s, Arad was founded in November 1962 as an Israeli development town, the first planned city in Israel. Arad's population grew significantly with the Aliyah from the former Soviet Union. Landmarks in Arad include the ruins of Tel Arad, Arad Park, a domestic airfield and Israel's first legal race circuit. The city is known for its annual summer music festival, the Arad Festival. ==History==  File:Tel Arad.JPG|thumb|Tel Arad Arad is named after the Biblical Bronze Age Canaanite town located at Tel Arad (a Biblical archaeology site famous for the discovery of ostracon|ostraca), which is located approximately  west of modern Arad. The Bible (Judges 1:16) describes it as a Canaanite stronghold whose king kept the Israelites from moving from the Negev to the Judean Mountains, although Tel Arad was destroyed over 1,200 years before the arrival of the Israelites. However, Shoshenq I's chronicles seem to mention a settlement in Tel Arad. After its destruction during the Canaanite era, the town lay abandoned for centuries before being resettled by the Israelites from the 11th century BC onward. The Israelites initially settled it as an unwalled piece of land cut off as an official or sacred domain was established on the upper hill. It was later a garrison-town known as "The Citadel". The citadel and sanctuary are believed to have been constructed at the time of Kings David and Solomon. Artifacts found within the sanctuary of the citadel mostly reflect offerings of oil, wine, wheat, etc. brought there by numerous people during the time of the Kingdom of Judah, up to Judah's fall to the Babylonians. Under the Judaean kings, the citadel was periodically refortified, remodeled and rebuilt, until ultimately it was destroyed between 597 BCE and 577 BCE whilst Jerusalem was under siege by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. However, during the Persian Empire|Persian, Maccabees|Maccabean, Roman Empire|Roman, and early Muslim eras, locals continued to transport these items to the sacred precinct of the upper hill. Markers of these ancient Israelite rituals remain to this day, with broken pottery littering the entire site. During the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period, the location was still correctly identified by Eusebius, and the name "Arad" was preserved by the Bedouins. Ancient Arad became a Christian bishopric. Stephanus, one of its bishops, was a signatory of the synodal letter of John III of Jerusalem against Severus of Antioch in 518 and took part in Council of Jerusalem (536)|the 536 synod of the three Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Salutaris (to the last of which Arad belonged) against Anthimus I of Constantinople.Michel Lequien, , Paris 1740, Vol. III, coll. 727â€“730Pius Bonifacius Gams, , Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;454 No longer a residential bishopric, Arad is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see."Annuario Pontificio 2013" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 836  The first modern attempt to settle the area was made by the Yishuv, the body of Jewish residents in Mandate Palestine|Mandatory Palestine, on 23 February 1921, when the British Mandate government allowed discharged soldiers from the Jewish Legion to settle in the area. Nine men and two women attempted the task, but after four months were forced to leave because water was not found in the area.  Image:WikiAir IL-13-06 015 - Arad.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Arad On 15 November 1960, a planning team, followed by a full-fledged committee on 29 December, was appointed by the Israeli cabinet to examine the possibility of establishing a city in the northeastern Negev desert and Arad region. An initial budget of Israeli pound|IL50,000 was granted for the project, headed by Aryeh Eliav. On 31 January 1961, the final location was chosen ( southwest of Mount Kidod), and plans were approved for roads and water connections. In March 1961, blueprints for a city of 10,000- 20,000 residents were drawn up. Yona Pitelson was the chief architect and planner. The plan took into account topography and climate, with residential buildings constructed with large inner courtyards that offered protection from the desert sun and wind. High density residential areas were built first in order to create an urban milieu and shorten walking distances. File:Arad plan.png|thumb|Original city plan for Arad The oil company Nefta built a work camp in the area in July 1961, consisting of six temporary sheds, after oil was found there in commercial quantities. The town itself was established in 1962 by a group of young ex-kibbutz and ex-moshav members seeking an environment free of overcrowding, traffic, noise, and pollution. The founding ceremony was held on 21 November, and attended by then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. It was one of the last development towns to be founded. According to the city website, Arad was the first pre-planned city in Israel. Until 1964 Arad had about 160 families, most of whom were natives. After 1971 Arad began absorbing "Aliyah|olim" (Jewish immigrants), mostly Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|from the Soviet Union, but also from English speaking countries and Latin America, and its population increased from 4,000 in 1969 to 10,500 in 1974 and 12,400 in 1983. During the first half of the 1990s, Arad absorbed 6,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union. In 1995, the city had 20,900 residents. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared Arad a city on 29 June 1995. ==Geography== File:AradMap.png|thumb|right|Neighborhoods of Arad Arad is located mostly on the western and southwestern Kidod Range, and the Arad Plain, which marks the southwestern end of the Judean Desert. It is located  west of the southern end of the Dead Sea, and is by road,  east of Beer Sheva|Beersheva,  south of Jerusalem,  south east of Tel Aviv, and  north of the southernmost city of Eilat. The city spans an area of , one of the largest municipal areas in Israel, even though its urban area is much smaller. In 1993, the city's jurisdiction was , still many times larger than the urban area. The historical site of Tel Arad and the Arad Park (also known as Ran Grove) can also be found within its municipal area, west of the urban core. Arad also has a commercial landing strip located slightly to the south of its urban core. It borders the Tamar Regional Council|Tamar and Abu Basma Regional Council|Abu Basma regional councils, and the closest local municipality to Arad is the Negev Bedouin|Bedouin local council Kuseife. ==Neighborhoods== File:Arad Gevim.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Gevim neighborhood from the southeast File:Arad Rotem.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Rotem neighborhood from the east File:Arad Shaked.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Shaked neighborhood from the southwest Each neighborhood in Arad contains streets named in a thematic manner, for example, a neighborhood where all streets are named after jewels. The exception to this are the four central quarters, which have more conventional street names, and the original two neighborhoods (Rishonim and Ne'urim). The themed neighborhoods make up the entire city north of Highway 31 (Israel)|Highway 31. South of the highway is Arad's industrial zone (the northern area being the light industry zone).
