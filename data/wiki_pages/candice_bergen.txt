Her mother, Frances Bergen (married and maiden names|née Westerman), was a John Robert Powers|Powers model who was known professionally as Frances Westcott. Her father, Edgar Bergen, was a ventriloquist, comedian, and actor. Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants who anglicized their surname, which was originally Berggren ("mountain branch"). Bergen was raised in Beverly Hills, California, and attended the Harvard-Westlake School. As a child, she was often described as "Charlie McCarthy's little sister", which irritated her (referring to her father's star ventriloquism|dummy)."So when I was born, it was only natural that I was known in the press not as Candice Bergen, but as "Charlie's sister."" (Bergen, "My Dad, Charlie and Me' in Jack Canfield, "et al.", "A Second Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul" 1998:36 She began appearing on her father's radio program at a young age,"Bergen & McCarthy 55-12-25 Christmas (Guest Candice Bergen)", listed on Golden Age OTR's playlist on Live365.com and in 1958, at age 11, with her father on Groucho Marx's quiz show "You Bet Your Life", as Candy Bergen. She said that when she grew up, she wanted to design clothes. She later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she was elected both Homecoming#Traditions|Homecoming Queen and Miss University, but, as Bergen later acknowledged, she failed to take her education seriously and after failing two courses in art and opera, she was asked to leave at the end of her sophomore year. She ultimately received an honorary doctorate from Penn in May 1992. She worked as a fashion model before she took up acting, featured on the covers of "Vogue". She received her acting training at HB Studio in New York City. ==Career==  Bergen made her screen debut playing a university student in the ensemble film "The Group (film)|The Group" (1966), directed by Sidney Lumet, who knew Bergen's family. The film delicately touched on the subject of lesbianism.  The film was a critical and financial success. After the film's success, Bergen left college to focus on her career. She played the role of Shirley Eckert, an assistant school teacher, in "The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles" (1966) with Steve McQueen.  The movie was nominated for several Academy Awards and was a big financial success. It was made for 20th Century Fox. She guest starred on an episode of "Coronet Blue", whose director Sam Wanamaker recommended her for a part in the comedy "The Day the Fish Came Out" (1967) directed by Michael Cacoyannis, distributed by Fox. The film was a box-office flop, but Fox nevertheless signed her to a long-term contract.  Bergen was announced for the role of Anne in "Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls", but did not appear in the film. Bergen went to France to appear in Claude Lelouch's romantic drama "Live for Life" (1967) opposite Yves Montand, popular in France but not the US. In 1968, she played the leading female role in "The Magus (film)|The Magus", a British mystery film for Fox starring Michael Caine and Anthony Quinn that was almost universally ridiculed on its release and was another major flop. She was featured in a 1970 political satire, "The Adventurers (1970 film)|The Adventurers", based on a novel by Harold Robbins, playing a frustrated socialite.  Her salary was $200,000.  The film received negative reviews, and while it did respectable business at the box office, it did not help her career. Bergen called it a "movie out of the 1940s." Bergen played the girlfriend of Elliott Gould in "Getting Straight (film)|Getting Straight" (1970), a counterculture movie which drew another spate of bad reviews, but was commercially profitable.  She said it took her career in "a new direction... my first experience with democratic, communal movie making." She also starred in the controversial Western "Soldier Blue" (1970), an overseas success but a failure in its homeland, perhaps because of its unflattering portrayal of the U.S. Cavalry.  The film's European success led to Bergen's being voted by British exhibitors as the seventh-most popular star at the British box office in 1971.Peter Waymark. "Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas." Times  30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.  Bergen appeared with Oliver Reed in "The Hunting Party (1971 film)|The Hunting Party" (1971), a violent Western which drew terrible reviews and flopped at the box office. Bergen received some strong reviews for her support role in "Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge" (1971), directed by Mike Nichols.  She then had the lead role in the drama "T.R. Baskin" (1971) and earned the best reviews of her career up to that time.  She described the latter as the first role "that is really sort of a vehicle, where I have to act and not just be a sort of decoration" saying she'd decided "it was time for me to get serious about acting." Bergen was absent from screens for a few years. She returned with a support part in a British heist film, "11 Harrowhouse" (1974), then did a Western with Gene Hackman and James Coburn, "Bite the Bullet (film)|Bite the Bullet" (1975).  Both films were modest successes.  In 1975, she replaced Faye Dunaway at the last minute to co-star with Sean Connery in "The Wind and the Lion" (1976), as a strong-willed American widow kidnapped in the Moroccan desert.  The film drew mixed reviews and broke even at the box office. Bergen was reunited with Hackman in "The Domino Principle" (1977) for Stanley Kramer, another failure.At the Movies Flatley, Guy. New York Times 10 Dec 1976: 62. She appeared in "A Night Full of Rain" (1978) for Lina Wertmüller and was the love interest of Ryan O'Neal's character in the "Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story" sequel, "Oliver's Story" (1978), but both films failed critically and financially.   Bergen appeared in the Burt Reynolds romantic comedy "Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over" (1979), for which she received Academy Awards|Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for best supporting actress. She portrayed a best-selling author in "Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous" (1981) with Jacqueline Bisset.'The Cool, Elegant Woman?: This Isn't Me The Times of India 22 Mar 1981: 16.  A remake of the Bette Davis film "Old Acquaintance", it was not a success. In 1982, Bergen appeared in the Academy Award for Best Picture|Oscar-winning film "Gandhi (film)|Gandhi" in which she portrayed documentary photographer Margaret Bourke-White.  Bergen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.  Beginning in the 1970s, Bergen became a frequent List of Saturday Night Live guests|guest host of "Saturday Night Live". She was the first woman to host the show, and the first host to do a second show.  She was also the first woman to join the Five-Timers Club, when she hosted for the fifth time in 1990.  Bergen also guest-starred on "The Muppet Show" in its first year. In 1984 she joined the Broadway cast of "Hurlyburly". On television, Bergen appeared as Morgan Le Fay in "Arthur the King" (1985) and in the miniseries "Hollywood Wives (miniseries)|Hollywood Wives" (1985).  She was Burt Reynolds' romantic interest in "Stick (film)|Stick" (1985), and for TV appeared in "Murder: By Reason of Insanity" (1985) and "Mayflower Madam" (1987).  In 1988, she took the lead role in the sitcom "Murphy Brown", in which she played a tough television reporter. The series provided her with the opportunity to show her little-seen comic talent, and although primarily a conventional sitcom, the show did tackle important issues. Murphy Brown, a recovering alcoholism|alcoholic, became a single mother and later battled breast cancer. In 1992, Vice President of the United States|Vice President Dan Quayle criticized prime-time TV for showing the Murphy Brown character "mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice." Quayle's disparaging remarks were subsequently written into the show, with Murphy shown watching Quayle's speech in disbelief at his insensitivity and ignorance of the reality of the lives of single mothers. A subsequent episode explored the subject of family values within a diverse set of families. The Brown character arranges for a truckload of potatoes to be dumped in front of Quayle's residence, an allusion to an infamous incident in which Quayle erroneously directed a school child to spell the word "potato" as "potatoe". In reality, Bergen agreed with at least some of Quayle's observations, saying that while the particular remark was "an arrogant and uninformed posture", as a whole, it was "a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did." Bergen's run on "Murphy Brown" was extremely successful. The show ran for ten seasons and between 1989 and 1998, Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times and won five. After her fifth win, she declined future nominations for the role.Candice Bergen, Straight Up: Murphy Brown explains herself—not that she has to Rewriting Murphy's Law Everything that can go right seems to have gone right for Candice Bergen.
