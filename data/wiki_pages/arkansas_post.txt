Eisenhower }}  The "Arkansas Post" () (Spanish language|Spanish: ""Puesto de Arkansas""), formally the "Arkansas Post National Memorial", was the first European colonization of the Americas|European settlement in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and present-day U.S. state of Arkansas. In 1686, Henri de Tonti established it on behalf of Louis XIV|Louis XIV of France for the purpose of trading with the Quapaw|Quapaw Nation. The Kingdom of France|French, Spanish Empire|Spanish, and Americans, who acquired the territory in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase, considered the site of strategic value. It was the capital of Arkansas Territory|Arkansas from 1819 until 1821 when the territorial government relocated to Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock. During the fur trade years, Arkansas Post was protected by a series of fortifications. The forts and associated settlements were located at three known sites and possibly a fourth. Some of the historic structures have been lost as the waterfront has been subject to erosion and flooding. The land encompassing the second (and fourth) Arkansas Post site (Red Bluff) was designated as a state park in 1929. In 1960, about  of land at the site were protected as the Arkansas Post National Memorial, a List of national memorials of the United States|National Memorial and National Historic Landmark. Since the 1950s, three Archaeology|archeological excavations have been conducted at Arkansas Post. Experts say the most extensive cultural resources at the site are archaeological, both for the 18th and 19th-century European-American settlements, and the earlier Quapaw villages. Due to changes in the river and navigation measures, the water level has risen closer to the height of the bluffs, which used to be well above the river. The site is now considered low lying. Erosion and construction of dams, canals, and Lock (water navigation)|locks on the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers have resulted in the remains of three of the historic forts now being underwater in the river channel. ==History==   File:Henri_de_Tonti.jpg|thumb|left|Henri de Tonti = <!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not add images to this section.

Thank you. --> The Arkansas Post was founded in the summer of 1686 by Henri de Tonti, Jacques Cardinal, Jean Couture, Peter Bisaillon, and three other Frenchmen as a trading post near the site of a Quapaw village named "Menard–Hodges site|Osotouy". It was about 35 miles upriver from the strategically significant confluence of the Arkansas River with the Mississippi River. The post was established on land given to De Tonti for his service in René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle's 1682 expedition. The French came to an arrangement with the local Quapaw to trade French goods for beaver furs. This arrangement did not yield much profit, as the Quapaw had little interest in hunting beaver. But the trade and friendly relations with the Quapaw and other local native peoples, such as the Caddo and Osage Nation|Osage, were integral to the post's survival for most of its operations. The French settlers initially called the post "Aux Arcs" ("at the home of the Arkansas." "Arkansea" was the Algonquian languages|Algonquian name used by the Illinois Confederation|Illinois and related tribes to refer to the Quapaw, and was adopted by the French.) The traders first built a simple wooden house and fence at the site. This was the first permanent French holding west of the Mississippi and the first European settlement in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Here the French conducted the first documented Christian services in Arkansas. The importance of the post was fully realized in 1699, when King Louis XIV|Louis XIV of France began to invest more resources into Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana. John Law (economist)|John Law's Mississippi Company made a venture from 1717 to 1724 recruiting Germans|German settlers to develop the surrounding area as a major agricultural hub. The plan was to grow crops on the lower Arkansas for trade with Arkansas Post, New Orleans (which did not have the climate to support grain cultivation), and Illinois Country|French Illinois. The French brought about 100 Slavery in New France|slaves and Indentured servitude|indentured servants to the area as workers, and offered land grants to German settlers. But this project failed when the company withdrew from Arkansas Post, due to financial decline related to the Mississippi Company#Mississippi Bubble|Mississippi Bubble. Most of the slaves and indentured servants were relocated or sold elsewhere along the Lower Mississippi River, but a few remained in or near the post, becoming hunters, farmers, and traders. By 1720, the post had lost much of its significance to the French because of the lack of profit, and the population was low.  In 1723, the post was garrisoned by thirteen French soldiers, and Lieutenant Avignon Guérin de La Boulaye was the commander. Father Paul du Poisson was the priest at the post from July 1727 until his death in 1729. The post was significantly expanded in 1731, when its new commander, First Ensign Pierre Louis Petit de Coulange, built a barracks, a magazine (artillery)|powder magazine, a prison, and a house for him and future commanders. On May 10, 1749, during the Chickasaw Wars, the post engaged in its first military action. Chief Payamataha of the Chickasaw attacked the rural areas of the post with 150 of his warriors, killing and capturing several settlers. The site of this first post is believed to be near what is now called the Menard–Hodges site, located about  (but about  by road) from the Arkansas Post Memorial.  This property, also a National Historic Landmark, is owned by the National Park Service, and is undeveloped. = <!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not add images to this section.

This was further from the Chickasaw territory east of the Mississippi, and closer to the Quapaw villages, the post's main trading partners and potential allies. This new location, about 45 miles from the mouth of the Arkansas, was called "Écores Rouges" (Red Bluff), at "the heights of the Grand Prairie". It was situated on a bend in the river, on higher ground than the previous site. In 1752, Captain Paul Augustin Le Pelletier de La Houssaye, the next commander, rebuilt the post's major structures, such as the barrack, prison, and powder magazine. In addition, he expanded the commander's house to include a chapel and quarters for the priest. He added a warehouse|storehouse, hospital, bake house, and latrine. To protect the post's new buildings, he erected a stockade eleven feet in height. = In 1756, after the start of the Seven Years' War between France and England, Captain Francois de Reggio moved the post to a location 10 miles from the confluence with the Mississippi in order for the post to better respond to British and Chickasaw attacks. Whereas the first two locations had been on the Arkansas's north bank, this one was on the south. The layout of this post was generally similar to earlier ones, containing the usual important structures protected by a stockade.  <!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not add images to this section.

Thank you. -->  After the British Empire|British defeated the French in the Seven Years' War and gained most of their North American territories east of the Mississippi, France ceded the area west of the Mississippi to Spain. This was in exchange for the British to gain land in Spanish Florida and give up any claims to Cuba. The post was officially ceded to Spain in 1763, but Spain did not take up its administration until 1771. Initially, the Spanish kept the post at the third site and built the first Fort Carlos there to defend it. The majority of the post's population remained French. This reality complicated Spain's effort for diplomacy. In 1772, Commander Fernando de Leyba was ordered to assert dominance over the local French and to reduce the amount of feasts and gifts they provided for the local Quapaw, as it was costing the colonial government too much. The Quapaw nearly came to blows with the Spanish, but eventually Commander Leyba conceded to previous practice and restored the goods, and conflict was avoided. = File:FortCarlos2diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of the 1760s era stockade. In 1777 and 1778, the post was partially inundated by floodwaters. The garrison captain, Balthazar de Villiers, wrote to the Spanish List of colonial governors of Louisiana|governor of Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez, requesting the post be moved upriver. De Villiers cited annual flooding and the long distance from the local Quapaw villages as concerns. In the fall of 1778, Colonel David Rogers and Capt. Robert Benham (politician)|Robert Benham made a stop here while on their way to meet with Gálvez to convince him that Spain should support the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. Gálvez gave permission for de Villiers to move the post back to the site of the second French post, 36 miles upriver at Red Bluff, and in 1779, the post was relocated. The colonists hoped the settlement would be less flood-prone. Fort Carlos III was built here in July 1781, near the former Le Houssaye fort. It consisted of several small buildings surrounded by a stockade. During the last two decades of the 18th century, several Americans from the new United States settled at the post. They developed a separate American village on the bluffs north of the river, nearer to the Quapaw villages. Many of these settlers arrived as refugees from the American Revolutionary War.

This was part of a small British campaign against the Spanish on the Mississippi River during the American Revolutionary War, when power was shifting in North America.
