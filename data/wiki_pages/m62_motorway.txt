The road is part of the unsigned International E-road network|Euroroutes European route E20|E20 (Shannon, County Clare|Shannon to Saint Petersburg) and European route E22|E22 (Holyhead to Ishim, Tyumen Oblast|Ishim). The motorway, which was first proposed in the 1930s, and conceived as two separate routes, was opened in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor near Huddersfield and finishing at that time in Tarbock on the outskirts of Liverpool. The motorway absorbed the northern end of the Stretford-Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960.  Adjusted for inflation to 2007, its construction cost approximately £765&nbsp;million. The motorway has an average daily traffic flow of 144,000 vehicles in West Yorkshire, and has several sections prone to gridlock, in particular, between Leeds and Huddersfield and the M60 section around Eccles. The M62 coach bombing of 1974 and the Great Heck rail crash of 2001 are the largest incidents to have occurred on the motorway. Stott Hall Farm, situated between the carriageways on the Pennine section, has become one of the best-known sights on the motorway. The M62 has no junctions numbered 1, 2 or 3, or even an officially numbered 4, because it was intended to start in Liverpool proper, not in its outskirts. Between Liverpool and Manchester, and east of Leeds, the terrain along which the road passes is relatively flat. Between Manchester and Leeds it traverses the Pennines and its foothills, rising to  above sea level slightly east of junction 22 in Calderdale, not far from the boundary between Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. ==Planning== The motorway's origins are found in the 1930s, when the need for a route between Lancashire and Yorkshire had been agreed after discussion by their county highway authorities. At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was needed to connect the ports to industrial Yorkshire. After the Second World War, the Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the A580 road|A580 East Lancashire Road in Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton and the A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road near Selby. The 1949 Road Plan for South Lancashire identified the need to upgrade the A580 to dual carriageway with grade separation and provide bypasses at Huyton and Cadishead. In 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, the Lancashire–Yorkshire Motorway, was laid down, with Ferrybridge at the eastern terminus rather than Selby. By the 1960s, the proposed A580 upgrade to dual carriageway was considered inadequate, and there was an urgent need to link Liverpool to the motorway network. The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire. When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience of the Interstate Highway System led him to conclude that the Merseyside Expressway, planned to run between Liverpool and the M6 motorway|M6, would need to be extended to the M63 motorway|Stretford-Eccles Bypass and beyond, to create a continuous motorway between Liverpool and Ferrybridge (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964). Initially the plans were unpopular and not supported by the Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport, but the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963.  Formal planning began on Wednesday 12 July 1961, when Ernest Marples authorised the two surveyors of Lancashire and the West Riding - Sir James Drake (engineer)|James Drake of Lancashire and Stuart Maynard Lovell of the West Riding, to plan a  motorway from Worsley, in Lancashire, to Ledsham, West Yorkshire|Ledsham (now the Selby Fork) in the West Riding. From either end, the plan was that there would be 'improved roads' from the eastern end, at the Selby Fork, eastwards to Hull, and 'improved roads' from the western end, at Worsley (now the Worsley Braided Interchange), westwards to Liverpool."Liverpool Echo" Thursday 13 July 1961, page 18 ==Construction==  It was the intention to build an urban motorway in Liverpool. The M62 was intended to terminate at Liverpool's Inner Motorway, which was not built. The proposed route would have followed the railway into Liverpool as far as Edge Hill railway station|Edge Hill, with junctions at Rathbone Road and Durning Road where it would drop to two lanes before terminating at the Islington Radial. Difficulties arose building the Liverpool urban motorway resulting in delays, with the section between Tarbock and Liverpool the last to be completed in 1976. In total, two viaducts, ten bridges and seven underpasses were constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential areas. The motorway was constructed only as far as the A5058 road|Queens Drive inner ring road, which is junction 4. The section west of Manchester was intended to be a separate motorway, the M52 to link Liverpool and Salford, but a continuous motorway between Leeds and Liverpool was deemed more feasible, Construction between Liverpool and Manchester started in 1971, with the construction of a link between the M57 motorway|M57 and M6 motorways. Simultaneously, a contract to link the M6 with Manchester was underway, which required land drainage and the removal of unsuitable earth. This section was completed in August 1974, creating a continuous link between Ferrybridge and Tarbock.   File:M62 construction in Milnrow.jpg|thumb|right|Construction starting in Milnrow, 1968 Two motorways were planned, the M52 from Liverpool to Salford and the M62 to link Pole Moor with the Stretford–Eccles Bypass. The first part of the M62 to be built was the Stretford–Eccles Bypass, which is now the section between Junctions&nbsp;7 to 13 of the M60 motorway|M60. Construction started in 1957, and the motorway opened in 1960. It was originally built as a two-lane motorway only. It was later re-numbered M63. The section of the planned M52 between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford opened as the M602 motorway in 1971. The Eccles–Pole Moor section of the M62 opened in 1971. Between Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles and Pole Moor, 67 motorway crossings were required, including seven viaducts and eight junctions. Much of the Worsley Braided Interchange was built on undeveloped Bog|mossland where deep peat deposits had been covered with waste. Between Worsley and Milnrow, some underlying coal seams were still actively worked when the motorway was constructed and allowances had to be made to counteract possible future subsidence. The motorway crosses the Irwell Valley and the Pendleton Fault on a  single-span bridge  above the River Irwell|river.  File:M62 Summit sign 29 July 2017.jpg|thumb|right|M62 Summit sign Surveying for the Pennine section began in November 1961 and its route was determined in July 1963. Construction between Windy Hill and Pole Moor was difficult through inhospitable hilly terrain, peat bog, and in undesirable weather conditions. The motorway's highest point,  above sea level at Windy Hill (Pennines)|Windy Hill near Denshaw () is the highest point of any motorway in England.{{cite web |url = https://www.panoramio.com/photo/7235243 |title = Photo of Highest motorway in England |via = Panoramio |date = ...
