He invented the equals sign (=) and also introduced the pre-existing Plus sign|plus (+) and Minus sign|minus (−) signs to English speakers in 1557. ==Biography== Born around 1512, Robert Recorde was the second and last son of Thomas and Rose Recorde of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, in Wales. Recorde entered the University of Oxford about 1525, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College there in 1531.  Having adopted medicine as a profession, he went to the University of Cambridge to take the degree of M.D. in 1545.  He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done prior to going to Cambridge. He invented the "equals" sign, which consists of two horizontal parallel lines, stating that no two things can be more equal.  It appears that he afterwards went to London, and acted as physician to King Edward VI of England|Edward VI and to Mary I of England|Queen Mary, to whom some of his books are dedicated.  He was also controller of the Royal Mint and served as Comptroller of Mines and Monies in Ireland.  After being sued for defamation by a political enemy, he was arrested for debt and died in the King's Bench Prison, Southwark, by the middle of June 1558. ==Publications== Image:First Equation Ever.png|thumb|350px|The first known equation, equivalent to  71}} in modern notation, from "The Whetstone of Witte".

Recorde published several works upon mathematical and medical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, such as the following: *"The Ground of Arts|The Grounde of Artes, teachings the Worke and Practise, of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions" (1543), the first English language book on algebra. *"The Pathway to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry ... bothe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall, and also for Projection of Plattes" (London, 1551) *"The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc." (London, 1556) A book explaining Ptolemy|Ptolemaic astronomy while mentioning the Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric model in passing. *"The Whetstone of Witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmeteke: containing the extraction of rootes; the cossike practise, with the rule of equation; and the workes of Surde Nombers" (London, 1557). This was the book in which the equals sign was introduced within a printed edition. With the publication of this book Recorde is credited with introducing algebra into the Island of Britain with a systematic notation.Robert Recorde, "The Whetstone of Witte" (London, England: John Kyngstone, 1557),  (although the pages of this book are not numbered). From the chapter titled "The rule of equation, commonly called Algebers Rule" (p. 236): "Howbeit, for easie alteration of "equations". I will propounde a fewe examples, bicause the extraction of their rootes, maie the more aptly bee wroughte. And to avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes: is equalle to: I will sette as I doe often in worke use, a paire of paralleles, or Gemowe  lines of one lengthe, thus: = , bicause noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle." (However, for easy manipulation of "equations", I will present a few examples in order that the extraction of roots may be more readily done. And to avoid the tedious repetition of these words "is equal to", I will substitute, as I often do when working, a pair of parallels or twin lines of the same length, thus: = , because no two things can be more equal.) * A medical work, "The Urinal of Physick" (1548), frequently reprinted., by Robert Recorde, 1548; at Google Books Most of those works were written in the form of a catechism. (here cited p. 131). Several books whose authors are unknown have been attributed to him: "Cosmographiae isagoge", "De Arte faciendi Horologium" and "De Usu Globorum et de Statu temporum".John Hall, "An Historiall Expostulation", p. 60.
