 In mathematics,  a "distributive lattice" is a lattice (order)|lattice in which the operations of join and meet distributivity|distribute over each other. The prototypical examples of such structures are collections of sets for which the lattice operations can be given by set union (set theory)|union and intersection (set theory)|intersection. Indeed, these lattices of sets describe the scenery completely: every distributive lattice is&mdash;up to order isomorphism|isomorphism&mdash;given as such a lattice of sets. ==Definition== As in the case of arbitrary lattices, one can choose to consider a distributive lattice "L" either as a structure of order theory or of universal algebra. Both views and their mutual correspondence are discussed in the article on lattice (order)|lattices. In the present situation, the algebraic description appears to be more convenient. A lattice ("L",∨,∧) is "distributive" if the following additional identity holds for all "x", "y", and "z" in "L": : "x" ∧ ("y" ∨ "z") = ("x" ∧ "y") ∨ ("x" ∧ "z"). Viewing lattices as partially ordered sets, this says that the meet operation Limit-preserving function (order theory)|preserves non-empty finite joins. It is a basic fact of lattice theory that the above condition is equivalent to its duality (order theory)|dual: §6, Theorem 9 : "x" ∨ ("y" ∧ "z") = ("x" ∨ "y") ∧ ("x" ∨ "z") &nbsp; for all "x", "y", and "z" in "L".For individual elements "x", "y", "z", e.g. the first equation may be violated, but the second may hold; see the N<sub>5</sub> picture for an example. In every lattice, defining "p"≤"q" as usual to mean "p"∧"q"="p", the inequality "x" ∧ ("y" ∨ "z") ≥ ("x" ∧ "y") ∨ ("x" ∧ "z") holds as well as its dual inequality "x" ∨ ("y" ∧ "z") ≤ ("x" ∨ "y") ∧ ("x" ∨ "z"). A lattice is distributive if one of the converse inequalities holds, too. More information on the relationship of this condition to other distributivity conditions of order theory can be found in the article on distributivity (order theory). == Morphisms == A morphism of distributive lattices is just a lattice homomorphism as given in the article on lattice (order)|lattices, i.e. a function that is compatible with the two lattice operations. Because such a morphism of lattices preserves the lattice structure, it will consequently also preserve the distributivity (and thus be a morphism of distributive lattices). == Examples == File:Young's lattice.svg|thumb|Young's lattice Distributive lattices are ubiquitous but also rather specific structures. As already mentioned the main example for distributive lattices are lattices of sets, where join and meet are given by the usual set-theoretic operations. Further examples include: * The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum algebra of most logics that support logical conjunction|conjunction and Logical disjunction|disjunction is a distributive lattice, i.e. "and" distributes over "or" and vice versa. * Every Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice. * Every Heyting algebra is a distributive lattice. Especially this includes all complete Heyting algebra|locales and hence all open set lattices of topological spaces. Also note that Heyting algebras can be viewed as Lindenbaum algebras of intuitionistic logic, which makes them a special case of the first example. * Every Total order|totally ordered set is a distributive lattice with max as join and min as meet. * The natural numbers form a (conditionally complete) distributive lattice by taking the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This lattice also has a least element, namely 1, which therefore serves as the identity element for joins. * Given a positive integer "n", the set of all positive divisors of "n" forms a distributive lattice, again with the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This is a Boolean algebra if and only if "n" is Square-free integer|square-free. * A Riesz space|lattice-ordered vector space is a distributive lattice. *Young's lattice given by the inclusion ordering of Young diagram#Diagrams|Young diagrams representing Partition (number theory)|integer partitions is a distributive lattice. * The points of a distributive polytope (a convex polytope closed under coordinatewise minimum and coordinatewise maximum operations), with these two operations as the join and meet operations of the lattice.. Early in the development of the lattice theory Charles S. Peirce believed that all lattices are distributive, that is, distributivity follows from the rest of the lattice axioms., p. xlvii., p. 33 bottom However, independence mathematical proof|proofs were given by Ernst Schröder (mathematician)|Schröder, Voigt,<sup>(:de:Andreas Heinrich Voigt|de)</sup> Jacob Lüroth|Lüroth, Alwin Korselt|Korselt, Korselt's non-distributive lattice example is a variant of "M"<sub>3</sub>, with 0, 1, and "x", "y", "z" corresponding to the empty set, a Line (geometry)|line, and three distinct points on it, respectively. and Richard Dedekind|Dedekind. == Characteristic properties == Various equivalent formulations to the above definition exist. For example, "L" is distributive if and only if the following holds for all elements "x", "y", "z" in "L": : ("x"<math>\wedge </math>"y")<math>\vee </math>("y"<math>\wedge </math>"z")<math>\vee </math>("z"<math>\wedge </math>"x") = ("x"<math>\vee </math>"y")<math>\wedge </math>("y"<math>\vee </math>"z")<math>\wedge </math>("z"<math>\vee </math>"x"). Similarly, "L" is distributive if and only if : "x"<math>\wedge </math>"z" = "y"<math>\wedge </math>"z" and "x"<math>\vee </math>"z" = "y"<math>\vee </math>"z" always imply "x"="y". <gallery caption="Hasse diagrams of the two prototypical non-distributive lattices" align="center"> Image:M3 1xyz0.svg|The diamond lattice "M"<sub>3</sub> is non-distributive:  = "x" ∧ 1 = "x" ≠ 0 = 0 ∨ 0 = . Image:N5 1xyz0.svg|The pentagon lattice "N"<sub>5</sub> is non-distributive:  = "x" ∧ 1 = "x" ≠ "z" = 0 ∨ "z" = . </gallery> File:Non-dstrbtive lattices-warning.png|thumb|Distributive lattice which contains N5 (solid lines, left) and M3 (right) as sub"set", but not as sub"lattice" The simplest "non-distributive" lattices are "M"<sub>3</sub>, the "diamond lattice", and "N"<sub>5</sub>, the "pentagon lattice". A lattice is distributive if and only if none of its sublattices is isomorphic to "M"<sub>3</sub> or&nbsp;"N"<sub>5</sub>; a sublattice is a subset that is closed under the meet and join operations of the original lattice. Note that this is not the same as being a subset that is a lattice under the original order (but possibly with different join and meet operations). Further characterizations derive from the representation theory in the next section. An alternative way of stating the same fact is that every distributive lattice is a subdirect product of copies of the Two-element Boolean algebra|two-element chain, or that the only Subdirectly irreducible algebra|subdirectly irreducible member of the class of distributive lattices is the two-element chain. As a corollary, every Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean lattice has this property as well.Balbes and Dwinger (1975), p. 63 citing Birkhoff, G. "Subdirect unions in universal algebra", Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. SO (1944), 764-768. Finally distributivity entails several other pleasant properties. For example, an element of a distributive lattice is Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|meet-prime if and only if it is Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|meet-irreducible, though the latter is in general a weaker property. By duality, the same is true for Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|join-prime and Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|join-irreducible elements.See Birkhoff's representation theorem#The partial order of join-irreducibles. If a lattice is distributive, its covering relation forms a median graph.. Furthermore, every distributive lattice is also modular lattice|modular. == Representation theory == The introduction already hinted at the most important characterization for distributive lattices: a lattice is distributive if and only if it is isomorphic to a lattice of sets (closed under Union (set theory)|set union and Intersection (set theory)|intersection). (The latter structure is sometimes called a ring of sets in this context.) That set union and intersection are indeed distributive in the above sense is an elementary fact. The other direction is less trivial, in that it requires the representation theorems stated below. The important insight from this characterization is that the identities (equations) that hold in all distributive lattices are exactly the ones that hold in all lattices of sets in the above sense. Birkhoff's representation theorem for distributive lattices states that every "finite" distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of Upper set|lower sets of the Partially ordered set|poset of its join-prime (equivalently: join-irreducible) elements. This establishes a bijection (up to isomorphism) between the class of all finite posets and the class of all finite distributive lattices. This bijection can be extended to a equivalence of categories|duality of categories between homomorphisms of finite distributive lattices and Monotonic function|monotone functions of finite posets. Generalizing this result to infinite lattices, however, requires adding further structure. Another early representation theorem is now known as Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices (the name honors Marshall Harvey Stone, who first proved it). It characterizes distributive lattices as the lattices of Compact space|compact open set|open sets of certain topological spaces. This result can be viewed both as a generalization of Stone's famous Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|representation theorem for Boolean algebras and as a specialization of the general setting of Stone duality. A further important representation was established by Hilary Priestley in her Priestley's representation theorem for distributive lattice|representation theorem for distributive lattices. In this formulation, a distributive lattice is used to construct a topological space with an additional partial order on its points, yielding a (completely order-separated) "ordered Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone space" (or "Priestley space"). The original lattice is recovered as the collection of clopen set|clopen lower sets of this space. As a consequence of Stone's and Priestley's theorems, one easily sees that any distributive lattice is really isomorphic to a lattice of sets. However, the proofs of both statements require the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of the axiom of choice. == Free distributive lattices == File:Monotone Boolean functions.svg|thumb|360px|Free distributive lattices on zero, one, two, and three generators. The elements labeled "0" and "1" are the empty join and meet, and the element labeled "majority" is ("x" ∧ "y") ∨ ("x" ∧ "z") ∨ ("y" ∧ "z") = ("x" ∨ "y") ∧ ("x" ∨ "z") ∧ ("y" ∨ "z"). The free object|free distributive lattice over a set of generators "G" can be constructed much more easily than a general free lattice. The first observation is that, using the laws of distributivity, every term formed by the binary operations <math>\lor</math> and <math>\land</math> on a set of generators can be transformed into the following equivalent "normal form": :<math>M_1 \lor M_2 \lor \cdots \lor M_n,</math> where <math>M_i</math> are finite meets of elements of "G". Moreover, since both meet and join are associative, Commutativity|commutative and Idempotence|idempotent, one can ignore duplicates and order, and represent a join of meets like the one above as a set of sets: :<math>\{N_1, N_2, \ldots, N_n\},</math> where the <math>N_i</math> are finite subsets of "G". However, it is still possible that two such terms denote the same element of the distributive lattice. This occurs when there are indices "j" and "k" such that <math>N_j</math> is a subset of <math>N_k.</math> In this case the meet of <math>N_k</math> will be below the meet of <math>N_j,</math> and hence one can safely remove the "redundant" set <math>N_k</math> without changing the interpretation of the whole term. Consequently, a set of finite subsets of "G" will be called "irredundant" whenever all of its elements <math>N_i</math> are mutually incompara ...
