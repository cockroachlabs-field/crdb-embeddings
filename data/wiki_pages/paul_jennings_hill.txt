Hill was sentenced to capital punishment in the United States|death by lethal injection and was executed on September 3, 2003. ==Early life== Paul Hill was born in Miami, Florida, on February 6, 1954, to Oscar Jennings Hill, an airline pilot, and his wife Louise. He was raised in Coral Gables, Florida. At the age of 17, Hill was charged with the assault of his father when his parents attempted to get him treatment for his drug abuse|drug problem. Hill said he experienced a religious conversion two years later in 1973, after being sent to a military school. , "Washington Post", August 7, 1994 Hill later enrolled in Belhaven University, where he met his future wife, Karen Demuth, with whom he had three children. ==Early career== Hill graduated from Reformed Theological Seminary, where he studied under Greg Bahnsen, a founder of the right-wing Christian Reconstructionist movement."Religion in Today's World: Global Issues, Sociological Perspectives" By Melissa M. Wilcox. p. 187. He attended St. Paul Presbyterian Church, which espoused theonomy, a movement related to Reconstructionism. Following his ordination in 1984, Hill became a minister (Christianity)|minister affiliated with both the Presbyterian Church in America and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. He was excommunication#Calvin's view on excommunication|excommunicated in 1993 following a number of nationally televised appearances in which he claimed to be the new national spokesperson for "defensive action" Anti-abortion violence|against abortion providers and claimed a connection to the Army of God (USA)|Army of God. , "Washington Post Sunday", p. A01. August 7, 1994 ==Crime, trial, and execution== On July 29, 1994, Hill approached the American Family Planning|Ladies Center, an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. When he spotted clinic doctor John Britton (doctor)|John Britton and his bodyguard, retired United States Air Force|USAF Lieutenant Colonel James H. Barrett, James H. Barrett Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force outside the clinic, he fired on both of them at close range with a Mossberg 500|Mossberg Model 500A Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge pump-action shotgun. Both Britton and Barrett died; Barrett's wife, June, was also wounded. Following the shots, Hill laid his shotgun on the ground and waited to be arrested. Following his arrest, Hill was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Florida for the First Circuit, charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Hill moved, successfully, to be allowed to appear "pro se"; i.e., he represented himself. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. Hill's motion to use the affirmative defense of justification was denied. According to Hill, his actions were a defensive act, rather than a retribution. On December 6, 1994, Hill was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to death. Appeals to the First District Court of Appeal, 656 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 1995), and subsequently to the Florida Supreme Court, 688 So.2d 901 (Fla.1996), were unsuccessful. Hill petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari (asked the Court to hear his appeal). The petition was denied. 522 U.S. 907 (1997). After losing his automatic appeals, Hill decided to waive the remainder of his appeals. The execution warrant for Hill was not signed until July 2003, at which time it was signed by Governor Jeb Bush. Hill died by lethal injection in Florida State Prison on September 3, 2003, aged 49. His last words were, "If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it. May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected." Hill chose Rev. Donald Spitz as his spiritual adviser during the last week of his life. Hill was close friends with Spitz both before and after he killed John Britton and James H. Barrett. Spitz was with Hill during the last week of his life and with Hill when he was executed. ==Motives and aftermath== Prior to the murders, Hill sent two position papers to Christian reconstructionism|Reconstructionist author Gary North (economist)|Gary North, which set out Hill's views of abortion and why he considered murder of abortionists to be warranted. The papers were followed by three additional letters to North in October 1994. North's responses, issued after the murders, comprised two letters that were made available to the public. The letters rejected and refuted Hill's theological arguments, and concluded that, "...the public will regard your dual assassination as the act of a condemned man outside of God's church and acting on his own in defiance of Bible-revealed law and therefore also God's moral law."  by Gary North (economist)|Gary North (critical response to Hill) Hill spent almost a decade in prison awaiting his execution. In a statement made before his execution, Hill's views on the murders remained unchanged; he said that he felt no remorse for his actions, and that he expected "a great reward in Heaven". Hill left behind a manuscript manifesto which his backers promised him they would publish. Hill also encouraged others who believe abortion is an illegitimate use of lethal force to "do what you have to do to stop it." , "Pensacola News Journal" (August 24, 2003) ==In media== While in police custody, Hill told the media "Now is the time to defend the unborn as to defend a slave that's about to be murdered." Hill's purported ties to the Army of God movement as well as his life and crimes are explored in the feature-length HBO Documentary film "Soldiers in the Army of God" (2000), directed by Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson as part of HBO's "America Undercover" Series. "Lake of Fire (film)|Lake of Fire", a 2006 documentary by Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye on the Abortion debate|abortion controversy in the United States, features footage of Hill protesting outside abortion clinics in Florida, and shows footage of Hill's arrest and trial. Hill also says to the filmmaker that "whatever force is justified in defending the life of a born child is also justified in defending the life of an unborn child." ==See also== * Capital punishment in Florida * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Florida * List of people executed in the United States in 2003 * Donald Spitz * David Trosch * Eric Rudolph * John Britton (doctor) * Shelley Shannon * Anti-abortion violence ==References==    Category:1954 births Category:2003 deaths Category:21st-century executions by Florida Category:21st-century executions of American people Category:1994 murders in the United States Category:American assassins Category:American people executed for murder Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:Army of God (United States) Category:Belhaven University alumni Category:Calvinist and Reformed clergy with criminal convictions Category:Executed assassins Category:Executed activists Category:Executed people from Florida Category:Former Presbyterians Category:Members of the clergy convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Florida Category:People excommunicated by Presbyterian churches Category:People executed by Florida by lethal injection Category:People from Coral Gables, Florida Category:People from Miami Category:Perpetrators of religiously motivated violence in the United States Category:American members of the clergy convicted of crimes Category:20th-century American clergy
