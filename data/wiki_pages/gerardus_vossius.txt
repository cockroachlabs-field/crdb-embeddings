Here in Dordrecht the son received his education, until in 1595 he entered the University of Leiden, where he became the lifelong friend of Hugo Grotius, and studied classics, Hebrew language|Hebrew, church history and theology.

From 1614 to 1619 he was director of the theological college at Leiden University. In the meantime, he was gaining a great reputation as a scholar, not only in the Netherlands, but also in France and England. But in spite of the moderation of his views and his abstention from controversy, he came under suspicion of heresy, and escaped expulsion from his office only by resignation (1619).
