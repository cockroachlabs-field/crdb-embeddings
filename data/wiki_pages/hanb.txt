  File:Hanbo.png|thumb|right The ""hanbō"" (半棒, "half-staff") is a Stick fighting|staff used in martial arts. Traditionally, the "hanbō" was approximately three "Shaku (unit)|shaku" or about  long, half the length of the usual staff, the "rokushakubō" ("six "shaku" staff"). Diameter was .  However, depending on the school the length and diameter varied. As with any weapon, bearers would often find one best suited to their build, opting often for one that comes up to about waist/hip height. ==Usage== "Hanbōjutsu", the art of wielding the "hanbō", is a focus in several martial arts including the "Kukishin-ryū" "koryū" classical school of martial arts, and "Kukishinden-ryū", one of the nine schools of "Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu". Part of the importance in using this length is that it is approximately that of a walking cane. Although techniques with a cane in this "ryū-ha" utilize pulling or hooking and possess one rounded end, they invariably function the same as a "hanbō" in all other respects. The hanbō can be held toward one end, and be swung like a katana or kendo sword. Additionally, it can be held in the middle like a staff and strike and block from either end. The "hanbō" can be used as a means of striking, restraining or even throwing someone. It is useful to know because sticks are abundant and can be picked up if attacked. Masaaki Hatsumi says that one who wishes to be a swordsman should first master "hanbō" techniques, since it can be held and utilized in a similar fashion to a Japanese sword (but without the cutting edge). When utilized properly (parrying by deflecting the sword by striking the flat parts of the blade), it can be used against a "katana". ==See also== * Bō * Budō * Bujutsu * Jō * Tambo (weapon)|Tambo or Tanjo <!-- Nb.
