There are three main river drainages for central Maryland:  the Potomac River to the west passing through Washington, D.C., the Patapsco River to the northeast passing through Baltimore, and the Patuxent River between the two.  The   Patuxent drainage basin|watershed had a rapidly growing population of 590,769 in 2000. It is the largest and longest river entirely within Maryland, and its drainage basin|watershed is the largest completely within the state. ==Geography== The river source,  from the Chesapeake, is in the hills of the Maryland Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont near the intersection of four counties – Howard County, Maryland|Howard, Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick, Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery and Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll, and only  from Parr's Spring, the source of the south fork of the Patapsco River.  Flowing in a generally southeastward direction, the Patuxent crosses the urbanized corridor between Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and opens up into a navigable tidal estuary near the colonial seaport of Queen Anne, Prince George's County, Maryland|Queen Anne in Prince George's County, Maryland, just southeast of Bowie, Maryland|Bowie.  The river is bounded by significant marsh areas for  from the Waysons Corner, Maryland|Waysons Corner area to the Hunting Creek confluence. The -long tidal estuary is never wider than . It marks the boundary between Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery, Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's, Charles County, Maryland|Charles and Saint Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's counties on the west and Howard County, Maryland|Howard, Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel, and Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert counties on the east. The Chesapeake estuary's deepest point,  below sea level, is in the lower Patuxent. The two largest cities in the watershed are Bowie, Maryland|Bowie and Laurel, Maryland. There is a percentage of agricultural activity in the region as well. The mid and lower banks of the river have swamp and marshland ecosystems. Many of those ecosystems are protected by some form of parkland, on the state and local levels. The most notable of which include Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Visitor's Center|Merkle Wetlands Sanctuary in the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Visitor's Center|Edgar A.

Farther north, there is the 20 square mile Patuxent Research Refuge, which helps to protect Patuxent River wildlife.  The "Little Patuxent River", the "Middle Patuxent River", and the "Western Branch" are the three largest tributaries. The Middle Patuxent flows into the Little Patuxent just upstream from the historic Savage Mill in Savage, Maryland|Savage. The Little Patuxent then joins the Patuxent just southwest of Crofton, Maryland|Crofton. The Middle Patuxent flows  through the middle of Howard County, while the Little Patuxent flows  through northeast and southeast Howard County and western Anne Arundel County.U.S. Geological Survey.

An archaeological dig at Bristol, MD|Pig Point (just north of Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary|Jug Bay at the end of Wrighton Road , at the end of Wrighton Road, Bristol, MD|Bristol, via Google Maps) uncovered some of the oldest known artifacts in the Mid Atlantic states,, E.B. Furgurson III, "The Archaeology News Network", April 2011. Original source: "The Capital"  including pottery, arrow and spear points, and remnants of wigwams, fires and foodways. The site was probably a center of trade in the region and has one of the best unbroken archaeological records on the East Coast. The Pig Point site includes remnants of the oldest structures ever found in Maryland, wigwam post holes dating to the third century. The word "Patuxent" is derived from the Algonquin language used by the indigenous people living in the area prior to the arrival of the European settlers. Its meaning is debated. According to some sources it means "water running over loose stones"Patuxent Riverkeeper - About the river: http://paxriverkeeper.org/about-the-river/ while others believe it means the "place where tobacco grows".Stein Charles Francis. 19771976.
