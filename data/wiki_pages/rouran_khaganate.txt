China's Borderland History and Geography Studies, Jun. 2003 Vol. 13 No. 2. Page 15. was a Tribe|tribal confederation and later state founded by a people of Proto-Mongols|Proto-Mongolic Donghu people|Donghu origin.Wei Shou. "Book of Wei".  "蠕蠕，東胡之苗裔也，姓郁久閭氏" tr. "Rúrú, offsprings of Dōnghú, surnamed Yùjiŭlǘ"*Pulleyblank, Edwin G. (2000). , "Early China". p. 20 The Rouran supreme rulers are noted for being the first to use the title of "khagan", having borrowed this popular title from the Xianbei.Vovin, Alexander (2007). "Once again on the etymology of the title "qaγan"". "Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia", vol. 12 () The Rouran Khaganate lasted from the late 4th century until the middle 6th century, when they were defeated by a Göktürks|Göktürk rebellion which subsequently led to the rise of the Turkic peoples|Turks in world history. Their Khaganate overthrown, some Rouran remnants possibly became Tatar confederation|TatarsXu Elina-Qian, , University of Helsinki, 2005. pp. 179–180Peter Benjamin Golden|Golden, Peter B. "Some Notes on the Avars and Rouran", in "The Steppe Lands and the World beyond Them". Ed. Curta, Maleon. Iași (2013). pp. 54–56. while others possibly migrated west and became the Pannonian Avars (known by such names as "Varchonites" or "Pseudo Avars"), who settled in Pannonia (centred on modern Hungary) during the 6th century.Findley (2005), p. 35. These Avars were pursued into the Byzantine Empire by the Göktürks, who referred to the Avars as a slave or vassal people, and requested that the Byzantines expel them. While this Rouran-Avars link remains a controversial theory, a recent DNA study has confirmed the genetic origins of the Avar elite as originating from the Mongolian plains. Other theories instead link the origins of the Pannonian Avars to peoples such as the Uar (tribe)|Uar. Considered an imperial confederation, the Rouran Khaganate was based on the "distant exploitation of agrarian societies", although many researchers claim that the Rouran had a feudal system, or "nomadic feudalism". The Rouran controlled trade routes, and raided and subjugated oases and outposts such as Gaochang. Their society is said to show the signs of "both an early state and a chiefdom". The Rouran have been credited as "a band of steppe robbers", because they adopted a strategy of raids and extortion of Northern China. The Khaganate was an aggressive militarized society, a "military-hierarchical polity established to solve the exclusively foreign-policy problems of requisitioning surplus products from neighbouring nations and states." ==Name==  "Róurán" 柔然 is a Classical Chinese transcription of the endonym of the confederacy;"Weishu"  "木骨閭死，子車鹿會雄健，始有部眾，"自號柔然"" "Mugulü died;  son Cheluhui, fierce and vigorous, began to gather the tribal multitude,  "self-appellation Rouran"" 蠕蠕 "Ruǎnruǎn" ~ "Rúrú" (Weishu), however, was used in Tuoba-Xianbei sources such as orders given by Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei."Weishu"  "而役屬於國。後世祖以其無知，狀類於蟲，故改其號為蠕蠕。" tr. "yet   vassal(s) of Northern Wei|(our) state. Later, Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei|(Emperor) Shizu took him/them as ignorant and  appearance worm-like, so  changed his/their appellation to Ruanruan ~ Ruru" It meant something akin to "wriggling worm" and was used in a derogatory sense. Other transcriptions are 蝚蠕 "Róurú" ~ "Róuruǎn" (Book of Jin|Jinshu); 茹茹 "Rúrú" (Book of Northern Qi|Beiqishu, Book of Zhou|Zhoushu, Suishu); 芮芮 "Ruìruì" (Book of Southern Qi|Nanqishu, Liangshu, Songshu), 大檀 "Dàtán" and 檀檀 "Tántán" (Songshu). Mongolian Sinologist Sühe Baatar suggests "Nirun" Нирун as the modern Mongolian term for the "Rouran", as Нирун resembles reconstructed Chinese forms beginning with *"ń"- or *"ŋ"-. Rashid-al-Din Hamadani recorded "Niru'un" and "Dürlükin" as two divisions of the Mongols.Golden, Peter B. "Some Notes on the Avars and Rouran", in "The Steppe Lands and the World beyond Them". Ed. Curta, Maleon. Iași (2013). p. 54.  Klyastorny reconstructed the ethnonym behind the Chinese transcription 柔然 "Róurán" (Eastern Han Chinese|LHC: *"ńu-ńan"; Middle Chinese|EMC: *"ɲuw-ɲian" > LMC: *"riw-rian") as *"nönör" and compares it to Mongolic languages|Mongolic нөкүр "nökür" "friend, comrade, companion" (Khalkha Mongolian|Khalkha нөхөр "nöhör"). According to Klyashtorny, *"nönör" denotes "stepnaja vol'nica" "a free, roving band in the steppe, the 'Comes|companions' of the early Rouran leaders". In early Mongol society, a "Nökör|nökür" was someone who had left his clan or tribe to pledge loyalty to and serve a charismatic warlord; if this derivation were correct, "Róurán" 柔然 was originally not an ethnonym, but a social term referring the dynastic founder's origins or the core circle of companions who helped him build his state.Golden, Peter B. (2016) "Turks and Iranians: Aspects of Türk and Khazaro-Iranian Interaction" in Turcologica 105. p. 5 However, Golden identifies philological problems: the ethnonym should have been *"nöŋör" to be cognate to "nökür", & possible assimilation of -/k/- to -/n/- in Chinese transcription needs further linguistic proofs. Even if 柔然 somehow transmitted "nökür", it more likely denoted the Rouran's status as the subjects of the Tuoba. Before being used as an ethnonym, Rouran had originally been the byname of chief Cheluhui (车鹿会), possibly denoting his status "as a Northern Wei|Wei servitor".Golden, Peter B. "Some Notes on the Avars and Rouran", in "The Steppe Lands and the World beyond Them". Ed. Curta, Maleon. Iași (2013). p. 58. ==History==  Primary Chinese-language sources Songshu and Liangshu connected Rouran to the earlier Xiongnu (of unknown ethnolinguistic affiliation) while Weishu traced the Rouran's origins back to the Donghu,Golden, Peter B. "Some Notes on the Avars and Rouran", in "The Steppe Lands and the World beyond Them". Ed. Curta, Maleon. Iași (2013). pp. 54–55. generally agreed to be Proto-Mongols. Xu proposed that "the main body of the Rouran were of Xiongnu origin" and Rourans' descendants, namely Da Shiwei (aka Tatars), contained Turkic elements, besides Mongolic Xianbei. Even so, the Xiongnu language|Xiongnu's language is still unknown and Chinese historians routinely ascribed Xiongnu origins to various nomadic groups, yet such ascriptions do not necessarily indicate the subjects' exact origins: for examples, Xiongnu ancestry was ascribed to Turkic-speaking Göktürks and Tiele people|Tiele as well as Para-Mongolic-speaking Kumo Xi and Khitan people|Khitans. However, historical developments show that the Xiongnu subsequently conquered Dong-Hu, the common ancestor of the Khitan people|Kitan and Kumo Xi peoples. Kwok Kin Poon additionally proposes that the Rouran were descended specifically from Donghu's Xianbei lineage, i.e. from Xianbei who remained in the eastern Eurasian Steppe after most Xianbei had migrated south and settled in Northern China.Hyacinth (Bichurin), Collection of information on peoples lived in Central Asia in ancient times, 1950. p. 209 Genetic testings on Rourans' remains suggested Donghu-Xianbei paternal genetic contribution to Rourans.{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Jiawei |last2=Zhao |first2=Jongbin |d ...
