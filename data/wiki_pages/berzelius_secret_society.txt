Berzelius Society symbol depicted within shield. "Berzelius" is a secret society at Yale University named for the Swedish scientist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, considered one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry.  Founded in 1848, 'BZ', as  the society is called often, is the third oldest society at Yale and the oldest of those of the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School, the institution which from 1854 to 1956 was the sciences and engineering college of Yale University. Berzelius became a senior society in the tradition of Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head (secret society)|Wolf's Head  in 1933 when the Sheffield Scientific School was integrated into Yale University. Book and Snake and St. Elmo (secret society)|St. Elmo, also societies from Sheffield, followed suit. Skull and Bones, founded in 1832, Scroll and Key, founded in 1841, and Wolf's Head (secret society)|Wolf's Head, founded in 1883, catered to students in the Academic Department, or liberal arts college. The alumni trust organization, the "Colony Foundation", owns the society's building.  Outsiders refer to the building as a 'tomb', the customary appellation for a secret society structure at Yale; however, many BZ members refer to their building as "The Hall." This is likely a transferred linguistic remnant of the tradition of the 'Sheff' secret societies, which had 'halls' for residential use and 'tombs' as separate meeting places, in contrast to the Yale College senior secret societies, which maintained only "tombs." == Architects of Berzelius Buildings == *Donn Barber.

(completed 1898, residential building, nonextant, brick Neo-Renaissance-style dormitory.  Bacon was an American Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architect best remembered for his severe Greek Doric Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. (built 1915–1922), which was his final project.  Yale purchased the building in 1933 for student housing and later used it for faculty offices. The building was demolished in 1969 to make way for the construction of the Yale Health Services Center, 17 Hillhouse Avenue. Architectural historian Patrick L. Pinnell notes in  "Yale University" that Berzelius sold to the Scroll and Key|Scroll and Key Society the site on which the latter erected its own tomb.Pinnell, Patrick L. (1999) , Princeton Architectural Press  Architectural historian Scott Meacham cites both Berzelius buildings in his study of Yale and Dartmouth society and fraternity architecture. The original building was built to resemble a Greek temple. The surviving ca. 1908-10 building's location, set off from the more active center of Yale's campus, lends privacy to Berzelius' members, and its unadorned largely blank exterior conveys to outsiders the deceptive sense that nothing much happens inside. In addition to the meeting room, dining area, and numerous study rooms, there are below-ground activity rooms with a pool table and ping pong table for recreation. BZ recently underwent a major restoration.

This process prepares its members — whose diversity is highly valued — for an active, intellectually vigorous, and moral life, giving them a place and time for contemplation and reflection so that they might rise boldly to the challenges of their lives, devoted to good character, tolerant of others, and willing to serve their communities, while forging links of mind to mind in a chain unbroken." ==See also== *Collegiate secret societies in North America *Manuscript Society *Book and Snake *Aurelian Honor Society ==References==  == External links == *    Category:Culture of Yale University Category:Secret societies at Yale Category:Student organizations established in 1848 Category:1848 establishments in Connecticut
