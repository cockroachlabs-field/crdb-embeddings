"Lossless Transform Audio Compression (LTAC)" is a audio data compression|compression algorithm developed by Tilman Liebchen, Marcus Purat and Peter Noll at Institute for Telecommunications, Technical University Berlin (TU Berlin), to compress Pulse-code modulation|PCM audio in a lossless compression|lossless manner, "unlike" conventional lossy compression|lossy audio data compression|audio compression algorithms (like MP3). LTAC will not be developed any further since it has been superseded by its successor Lossless Predictive Audio Compression (LPAC), which is based on linear prediction. This makes it much faster than LTAC and even leads to better compression results. LPAC has become official standard as MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding. == See also == * Lossless Predictive Audio Compression (LPAC) == References ==   }} == External links == *    Category:Lossless audio codecs
