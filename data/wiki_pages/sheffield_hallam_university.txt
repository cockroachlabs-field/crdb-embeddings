The university is based on two sites; the City Campus is located in the city centre near Sheffield railway station, while the Collegiate Crescent Campus is about two miles away in the Broomhall Estate off Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. A third campus at Brent Cross Town in the London Borough of Barnet is expected to open for the 2025-26 academic year. The university is the List of universities in the United Kingdom by enrolment| largest university in the UK (out of ) with  students (of whom 4,400 are international students), 4,494 staff and 708 courses. ==History==  In 1843, as the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom|industrial revolution gathered pace and Sheffield was on the verge of becoming the steel, tool and cutlery making capital of the world, the Sheffield School of Design was founded following lobbying by artist Benjamin Haydon. The day-to-day running was controlled by the local council, whilst the Board of Trade in London appointed the head. Tuition began in a 60x40ft rented room off Glossop Road.Basford, John A School of Art is Beginning, From Sheffield Government School of Design to Sheffield Hallam University, Part 1 1843–1963, Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam University, p. 3 In 1850, the School of Design was renamed Sheffield School of Art. In 1905, the City of Sheffield Training College (later renamed Sheffield City College of Education) on Collegiate Crescent admitted its first 90 students. During the World War I|First World War, the Collegiate Hall was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 3rd Northern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. A new city centre campus was constructed during the 1960s. During construction, in February&nbsp;1962, a tower crane on site collapsed during the Great Sheffield Gale. It crashed into the side of what would become the Owen Building, causing serious damage and setting back construction. In 1967, the Owen Building was completed. Built in a functional 1960s design, it has since been modernised and comprehensively renovated with an atrium linking it to four adjacent buildings. In 1969 the Sheffield School of Design merged with the city's College of Technology to form Sheffield Polytechnic. In 1976, Sheffield Polytechnic merged with the city's two teacher training colleges (Sheffield City College and Totley Hall College) and was renamed Sheffield City Polytechnic. In 1987 Sheffield City Polytechnic became a founding member of the NCUK|Northern Consortium.see   In 1992, Sheffield City Polytechnic became Sheffield Hallam University (SHU), with the right to award its own degrees.

The new Faculty of Development and Society, with an emphasis on 'people, places and spaces', brought together education, geography, humanities, law, and social sciences.  At the same time, with the intention of further developing research and teaching in the new Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, a new Clinical Academic Group was launched.  The building that had been designed and constructed to house the National Centre for Popular Music became the university's students' union building (the HUBS).  The Nelson Mandela Building, the former students' union building (when opened in 1978 was known as the Phoenix building), was sold and has since been demolished. In 2007, SHU took over the teaching of nursing and midwifery from the University of Sheffield.  These activities are now based at the Collegiate Crescent Campus. The following year the Psalter Lane campus (formerly the Sheffield College of Art) was closed, and the activities transferred to the City Campus. The £26 million energy-efficient Furnival Building opened in September (renamed Cantor Building in 2011 in recognition of a major donor to the university).  The building, which includes teaching spaces and an Sheffield Institute of Art Gallery|art gallery has been described as "the impressive new entry point to the campus". For the 2025-26 academic year, the University expects to open its London campus at the Brent Cross Town development in the London Borough of Barnet. The campus will accommodate up to 5,000 students by 2030. ==Organisation and governance==  File:Sheffield Hallam University buildings.jpg|thumb|Charles Street building File:SHU buildings.png|thumb|SHU's Owen Building (left) and Stoddart Building (right), part of the City Campus on Arundel Gate  File:Collegiate Campus, SHU.jpg|thumb|Collegiate Campus, Sheffield Hallam University File:SHU Students Union 30 Oct 2017 2.jpg|thumb|Sheffield Hallam Students' Union In 2020, the university relaunched its structure moving away from four faculties and re-organising academic departments into colleges.
