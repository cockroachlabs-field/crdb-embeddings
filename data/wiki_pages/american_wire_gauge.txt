  "American wire gauge" ("AWG"), also known as the "Brown & Sharpe wire gauge", is a logarithmic Step function|stepped Standardization|standardized wire gauge system used since 1857, predominantly in North America, for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, Electrical conduction|electrically conducting wire. Dimensions of the wires are given in ASTM standard B 258. The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its ampacity|current-carrying ampacity. Increasing gauge numbers denote decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other SI|non-metric gauging systems such as British Standard Wire Gauge (SWG), but unlike IEC 60228, the metric system|metric wire-size standard used in most parts of the world. This gauge system originated in the number of Wire drawing|drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30&nbsp;gauge) required more passes through the Draw plate|drawing dies than 0&nbsp;gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose. The AWG tables are for a single, solid and round conductor. The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG. AWG is also commonly used to specify Body jewelry sizes|body piercing jewelry sizes (especially smaller sizes), even when the material is not metallic. ==Formulas== By definition,  }} is 0.005&nbsp;inches in diameter, and Nr.&nbsp;0000 is 0.46&nbsp;inches in diameter, or nearly half-an-inch. The ratio of these diameters is 1:92, and there are 40&nbsp; gauge sizes from the smallest  }} to the largest  }}, or 39&nbsp;steps. Each successive gauge number decreases the wire diameter by a constant factor. Any two neighboring gauges (e.g., AWG  and AWG  ) have diameters whose ratio (dia.  ÷ dia. ) is <math>\sqrt {92} \approx 1.12293 \; ,</math> while for  gauges two steps apart (e.g., AWG , AWG , and AWG ), the ratio of the  to  is about  The diameter of an  wire is determined according to the following formula: :<math> d_n = 0.005 \; \text{inch} \times 92^{(36 - n)/39} = 0.127 \;\text{mm} \times 92^{(36 - n)/39}~.</math> (where  is the  size for gauges from 36 to 0,   −1}} for Nr.&nbsp;00,   −2 }} for &nbsp;000, and   −3}} for &nbsp;0000.

Common values of “” are 10 (base 10 logarithm|base&nbsp;10 logarithms, usually shown as just  on the keys of most calculators; a more explicit notation is to write out <math>\, \log_{10}(\cdot) ~</math>). Likewise, most hand calculators show the natural logarithm as , or more explicitly as <math>\,\log_e(\cdot) \equiv \ln(\cdot)~,</math> where  is Leonhard Euler|Euler's number, <math>\, e \approx 2.7182819~.</math> "Any" logarithm will do, including exotic logarithms such as the binary or base-two logarithm <math>\;\log_2(\cdot)~;</math> the only caveat is that the "same" logarithm must be used throughout any one calculation. }} ;Step 1: "Calculate the ratio" <math>\,\mathcal R \,</math> of the wire's diameter <math>\,d\,</math> to the standard gauge (&nbsp;#36 ) ::<math>\mathcal R = \frac{\; d_\text{  } \;}{ 0.005\,\text{ inch } }  = \frac{ d_\text{  } }{\; 0.127\,\text{ mm } \;}</math> :where the middle expression with <math>\,d_\text{}\,</math> is used if <math>\,d\,</math> is measured in inches, and the right-hand expression with <math>\,d_\mathrm{}\,</math> when <math>\,d\,</math> is measured in millimeters. ;Step 2 : "Calculate the American wire gauge number"  using "any" convenient logarithm; pick any one of the following expressions in the last two columns of formulas to calculate ; notice that they differ in the choice of base of the logarithm, but otherwise are identical: ::<math> \begin{align}  n  = \; -39       \log_{92}( \mathcal{R} )                               + 36  \;    &= \; -39\frac{ \log_{10}( \mathcal{R} ) }{ \; \log_{10}( 92 ) \;}  \,  + 36 \;    &&=\; -39\frac{  \ln     ( \mathcal{R} ) }{ \;   \ln    ( 92 ) \;} \;\; \, + 36 \; \\ \\    &= \; -39\frac{  \log_{e}( \mathcal{R} ) }{ \;  \log_{e}( 92 ) \;}  \; + 36 \;    &&=\; -39\frac{  \log_{2}( \mathcal{R} ) }{ \;  \log_{2}( 92 ) \;} + 36  \; \\ \\    &= \; -39\frac{  \log_{B}( \mathcal{R} ) }{ \;  \log_{B}( 92 ) \;} + 36  ~,  \\  \end{align} </math> :In general, the calculation can be done using any base  strictly greater than zero.) is the same in both the numerator and denominator for any one calculation. }} and the cross-section area is :<math>A_n = \frac{\pi}{4} d_n^2 = \frac{\pi}{4}\left(\, 0.005 \text{ inch } \right)^2 \times 92^{ ( 36 - n ) / 19.5 } \approx 0.000019635 \text{ inch}^2 \times 92^{ ( 36 - n ) / 19.5 } \approx 0.012668 \text{ mm}^2 \times 92^{ ( 36 - n ) / 19.5 } \; .</math> The standard ASTM B258-02 defines the ratio between successive sizes to be the 39th root of 92, or approximately 1.1229322. ASTM B258-02 also dictates that wire diameters should be tabulated with no more than 4&nbsp;significant figures, with a resolution of no more than 0.0001&nbsp;inches (0.1&nbsp;mils) for wires larger than Nr.&nbsp;44&nbsp;, and 0.00001&nbsp;inches (0.01&nbsp;mils) for wires Nr.&nbsp;45&nbsp; and smaller. Large  wires have gauge sizes denoted by multiple zeros – 0, 00, 000, and 0000 – the more zeros, the larger the wire, starting with &nbsp;0. The two notations overlap when the 2&nbsp;step formula for , above, produces zero. In that case the gauge number  is zero, it's taken as-is. If  is a "negative" number, the gauge number  is notated by multiple zeros, up to just under a half-inch; beyond that point, the “wire” may instead considered a copper bar or rod. The gauge can be denoted either using the long form with several zeros or the short form &thinsp;"/0" called gauge ""number of zeros"/0" notation. For example 4/0 is short for &nbsp;0000. For any &thinsp;/0&nbsp;wire, use the number of zeros <math>\; z = -n + 1 ~\mathsf{\text{ for } } ~ n < 0 \;,</math> &nbsp; and similarly &nbsp; <math>\; n = -z + 1   ~\mathsf{\text{ for } } ~ z > 0 ~.</math> in the above formulas. For instance, for &nbsp;0000 or 4/0, use <math>\, n = -4 + 1 = -3 ~ .</math>  The sixth power of  is very close to 2,The result is roughly 2.0050, or one-quarter of one percent higher than 2 which leads to the following rules of thumb: * When the "Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area" of a wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 3&nbsp;. (E.g. two  Nr.&nbsp;14  wires have about the same cross-sectional area as a single  nr.&nbsp;11 wire.)  This doubles the conductance. * When the "diameter" of a wire is doubled, the  will decrease by&nbsp;6&nbsp;. (E.g.  nr.&nbsp;2 is about twice the diameter of  nr.&nbsp;8&nbsp;.)  This quadruples the cross-sectional area and the conductance. A decrease of ten gauge numbers, for example from nr.&nbsp;12 to nr.&nbsp;2, multiplies the area and weight by approximately&nbsp;10, and reduces the electrical resistance (and increases the Electrical conductance|conductance) by a factor of approximately&nbsp;10. For the same cross section, aluminum wire has a conductivity of approximately 61% of copper, so an aluminum wire has nearly the same resistance as a copper wire smaller by 2  sizes, which has 62.9% of the area. ==Tables of AWG wire sizes== The table below shows various data including both the resistance of the various wire gauges and the allowable current (ampacity) based on a copper conductor with plastic insulation.  The diameter information in the table applies to "solid" wires.  Wire#Stranded wire|Stranded wires are calculated by calculating the equivalent cross section (geometry)|cross sectional Copper wire and cable|copper area.  Fusing current (melting wire) is estimated based on  ambient temperature.  The table below assumes direct current|DC, or Alternating current|AC frequencies equal to or less than 60&nbsp;Hz, and does not take skin effect into account.  "Turns of wire per unit length" is the reciprocal of the conductor diameter; it is therefore an upper limit for wire wound in the form of a helix (see solenoid), based on uninsulated wire. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" ! rowspan=4 | AWG ! rowspan=3 colspan=2 | Diameter ! rowspan=3 colspan=2 | Turns of wire, <br/>without <br/>insulation ! rowspan=3 colspan=2 | Area ! colspan=9 | Copper wire |- ! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Resistivity|Resistance per unit length Figure for solid copper wire at 68&nbsp;°F, (Not in accordance to NEC Codebook 2014 Ch. 9, Table 8) computed based on 100% IACS conductivity of 58.0&nbsp;MSiemens (unit)|S/m, which agrees with multiple sources: *  (although the ft/m conversion seems slightly erroneous) * Belden (electronics company)|Belden Master Catalog, 2006, although data from there for gauges 35 and 37–40 seems obviously wrong.
