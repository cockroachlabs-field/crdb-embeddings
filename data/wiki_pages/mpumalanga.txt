The name means ""East"", or literally ""The Place Where the Sun Rises"" in the Nguni languages|Swazi, Xhosa, Ndebele and Zulu languages. Mpumalanga lies in eastern South Africa, bordering Eswatini and Mozambique. It constitutes 6.5% of South Africa's land area. It shares borders with the South African provinces of Limpopo to the north, Gauteng to the west, the Free State (province)|Free State to the southwest, and KwaZulu-Natal to the south. The capital is Mbombela. Mpumalanga was formed in 1994, when the area that was the Eastern Transvaal (province)|Transvaal was merged with the former bantustans KaNgwane, KwaNdebele and parts of Lebowa and Gazankulu. Although the contemporary borders of the province were only formed at the end of apartheid, the region and its surroundings has a history that extends back thousands of years. Much of its history, and current significance is as a region of trade. == History ==  File:Iziko Lydenburg Heads 2.JPG|alt=Lydenburg Head |thumb|One of the Lydenburg heads|Lydenburg Heads from around A.D. 500 found in Mpumalanga  Archeological sites in the Mpumalanga region indicate settlement by humans and their Human ancestors|ancestors dating back 1.7 million years. Rock paintings, engravings and other archeological evidence throughout the province indicate that Mpumalanga has a long history of human habitation by groups of hunter gathers. Excavations not far from the Mpumalanga border in the Ohrigstad|Origstad district, show evidence of Middle Stone Age habitation dating back to 40,000 years ago. The Lion Cavern, in Ngwenya on the Eswatini border, shows evidence of people mining Iron ore in Africa|iron ore in the Mpumalanga region and surrounding areas from at least 28 000 years ago. Evidence from mine shafts and trade goods shows that there was notable industry in tin, copper, gold, iron, ochre, and bronze. The Lydenburg heads|Lydenburg Heads, from around 500 CE, are Africa's oldest Iron Age artworks south of the equator were found in Mpumalanga. Evidence from a site near Mbombela shows evidence of agricultural societies from between the 6th to 17th century.

The Heritage Portal |url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/article/one-most-extraordinary-archaeological-and-historical-phenomena-southern-africa |access-date=14 September 2020 |website=www.theheritageportal.co.za}} These societies became centers of trade, with increasingly large and centralised populations, a pattern that increased as they connected to the Portuguese trading post in Maputo Bay. In this era, groups that would become the Swazi people|Swazi, Pedi people|Pedi, Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele, MaPulana|Mapulana and others established themselves in the area that is now Mpumalanga.  In 1845, as part of the Great Trek, the first Dutch-speaking colonial settlers arrived in what they called the eastern Transvaal. The rest of the 19th century in the region was characterised by colonial encroachment and conflict over land and political control. In 1852, the Boers established the South African Republic. The well established Pedi, Swazi and Zulu kingdoms put up significant resistance against the settlers. The Pedi people|Pedi fought wars with the Boers in 1876 (see South African Wars (1879–1915)|Sekhukhune Wars) and the Zulu Kingdom|Zulu fought with 1820 Settlers|British settlers in 1879 (see Anglo-Zulu War). These interconnected conflicts played a role in shifting the balance of power in southern Africa to colonial control. After 1860, missionaries, especiailly German missionaries like Alexander Merensky set up mission stations in the region, spreading Christianity and European values. Just as the region had been a center for trade in the precolonial era, in the colonial era, the Eastern Transvaal region became an important thoroughfare for trade between Johannesburg and Delagoa Bay (now Maputo). Gold mining around areas like Pilgrim's Rest, South Africa|Pilgrims Rest and Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton and farming were the main forms of economic activity. On farms in the Transvaal, under a system known as Inboekstelsel, Boers carried out raids to capture children and forced them into indentured labour. During the Second Boer War|South African War, the region was the site of notable battles.  When the National Party (South Africa)|National Party came to power in 1948, their policy of apartheid  intensified the segregation that had defined communities in the Transvaal (province)|Transvaal. Under a policy of forced removals, Black South Africans were evicted from areas reserved for white people and moved into homelands, including KaNgwane, KwaNdebele, Lebowa and Gazankulu. South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/mpumalanga |access-date=2022-05-26 |website=www.sahistory.org.za}} As the apartheid regime implemented oppressive Apartheid legislation|policies that defined almost every aspect of life, activists responded with resistance. In 1959, the small town of Bethal on what is now the Mpumalanga highveld was the center of the South African potato boycott|anti-apartheid consumer potato boycott in response to the working conditions Black South African labourers faced on farms in the area. South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/dont-eat-potatoes |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=www.sahistory.org.za}} The region was influenced by dynamics in exile and elsewhere in the country, for instance Black Consciousness Movement|Black Consciousness, the Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville Massacre and the Soweto uprising|1976 Soweto Uprisings. In the 1980s, under intense repression, youth and labour organizations moblized against the government and townships and Bantustans erupted in political unrest and violence.  In 1986, an avoidable disaster killed 177 mine workers in Kinross, Mpumalanga|Kinross Mine in the region's highveld. The respo ...
