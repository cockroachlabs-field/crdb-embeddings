    "Parliamentary opposition" is a form of opposition (politics)|political opposition to a designated government, particularly in a Westminster system|Westminster-based parliamentary system. This article uses the term "executive (government)|government" as it is used in Parliamentary systems, i.e. meaning "the administration" or "the cabinet" rather than "the state". In some countries the title of ""Official Opposition"" is conferred upon the largest political party sitting in opposition in the legislature, with said party's leader being accorded the title "Leader of the Opposition". In First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post assemblies, where the Duverger's law|tendency to gravitate into two major political party|parties or party groupings operates strongly, "government" and "opposition" roles can go to the two main groupings serially in alternation. The more proportional a representative system, the greater the likelihood of multiple political parties appearing in the parliamentary Debate chamber|debating chamber. Such systems can foster multiple "opposition" parties which may have little in common and minimal desire to form a united bloc opposed to the government of the day. Some well-organised democracies, Dominant-party system|dominated long-term by a single faction, reduce their parliamentary opposition to tokenism. In some cases, in more authoritarian countries, tame "opposition" parties are created by the governing groups in order to create an impression of democratic debate. Some legislatures offer opposition parties particular powers. In Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, 20 days each year are set aside as "Opposition day|Opposition Days" or "Supply Days", during which the opposition gets to set the agenda. Canada also has a Question Period, during which the opposition (and the Parliament generally) can ask questions of government ministers. ==See also== * Loyal opposition * Opposition Party (Hungary) * Official Opposition (Canada) * Official Opposition (India) * Official Opposition (New Zealand) * His Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition|His Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom) * Opposition (Australia) * Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (South Africa) * Opposition (Malaysia) * Opposition (Croatia) * Opposition Front Bench (Ireland) * Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong) & Localist groups (Hong Kong) (Opposition camp in Hong Kong) * Ruling party * Shadow cabinet * The Establishment * Minority leader * His Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (Gibraltar) * Anti-Administration party ==References==  Category:Parliamentary opposition|  Category:Legislatures Category:Westminster system
