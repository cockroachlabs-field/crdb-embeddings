The city is known as the first settlement in Europe to be granted Coat of arms of Košice|its own coat-of-arms.Lucinda Mallows: , Globe Pequot Press, Connecticut, 2007 ==Etymology== The first written mention of the city was in 1230 as "Villa Cassa". The name probably comes from the Slavic personal name "Koš", "Koša" → "Košici" (Koš'people) → "Košice" (13821383) with the patronymic slavic languages|Slavic suffix "-ice" through a natural development in Slovak (similar place names are also known from other Slavic countries). In Hungarian "Koša" → "Kasa", "Kassa" with a vowel mutation typical for the borrowing of old Slavic names in the region (Vojkovce → Vajkócz, Sokoľ → Szakalya, Szakál, Hodkovce → Hatkóc, etc.). The Latinized form "Cassovia" became common in the 15th century. Another theory is a derivation from Old Slovak "kosa", "clearing", related to modern Slovak "kosiť", "to reap". Though according to other sources the city name may derive from an old Hungarian the first Hungarian names|name which begins with "Ko".Magyar Nyelvtudományi Társaság (Society of Hungarian Linguistics), , Akadémiai Kiadó, 1922, p. 142, Cited: "Kokos (Kakas), Kolumbán (Kálmán), Kopov (Kopó), Kokot (Kakat hn.) stb.

The first written reference to the Hungarian town of Košice (as the royal village – "Villa Cassa") comes from 1230. After the Battle of Mohi|Mongol invasion in 1241, King Béla IV of Hungary invited German colonists (see: Zipser Germans, Germans of Hungary) to fill the gaps in population. The city was in the historic Abauj County of the Kingdom of Hungary. The city was made of two independent settlements: Lower Kassa and Upper Kassa, amalgamated in the 13th century around the long lens-formed "ring", of today's Main Street. The first known town privileges come from 1290. The city proliferated because of its strategic location on an international trade route from agriculturally rich central Hungary to central Poland, itself along a greater route connecting the Balkans and the Adriatic Sea|Adriatic and Aegean Sea|Aegean seas to the Baltic Sea. The privileges given by the king were helpful in developing crafts, business, increasing importance (seat of the royal chamber for Upper Hungary), and for building its strong fortifications. In 1307, the first guild regulations were registered here and were the oldest in the Kingdom of Hungary. As a Hungarian Royal free city|free royal town, Košice reinforced the king's troops in the crucial moment of t ...
