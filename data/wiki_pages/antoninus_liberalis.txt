 File:Antoninus Liberalis Transformationum congeries 1676.jpg|thumb|Antoninus Liberalis Transformationum congeries, 1676 edition "Antoninus Liberalis" () was an Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek grammarian who probably flourished between AD 100 and 300.Celoria, : "His dates are a matter of nervous speculation: 'second to third century AD'.". == Work == His only surviving work is the "Metamorphoses" (Μεταμορφώσεων Συναγωγή, "Metamorphoseon Synagoge", literally "Collection of Transformations"), a collection of forty-one very briefly summarised tales about mythical metamorphoses effected by offended deities, unique in that they are couched in prose, not verse. The literary genre of myths of transformations of men and women, heroes and nymphs, into stars (see "Catasterismi"), plants and animals, or springs,  rocks and mountains, were widespread and popular in the classical world. This work has more polished parallels in the better-known "Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses" of Ovid and in the "The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses" of Lucius Apuleius. Like them, its sources, where they can be traced, are Hellenistic works, such as Nicander's "Heteroeumena" and  "Ornithogonia" ascribed to Boios.Timothy Renner, "A Papyrus Dictionary of Metamorphoses,", "Harvard Studies in Classical Philology" (1978:278); many of Antoninus Liberalis' transformations are also into birds. The work survives in a single manuscript, of the later 9th century, now in the Palatine Library in Heidelberg; it contains several works. John of Ragusa brought it to the Dominican convent at Basel about 1437; in 1553, Hieronymus Froeben gave it to Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, who gave it to the Library. In 1623, with the rest of the Palatine Library, it was taken to Rome; in 1798, to Paris, as part of Napoleonic plunder under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino; in 1816, it was restored to Heidelberg.Heidelberg al. gr. 398. Guilielmus Xylander printed the text in 1568; since some leaves have since disappeared, his edition is also a necessary authority for the text. Many of the transformations in this compilation are found nowhere else, and some may simply be inventions of Antoninus. The manner of the narrative is a laconic and conversational prose: "this completely inartistic text," as Sarah Myers called it,Myers, University of Michigan, reviewing Celoria's translation in "Bryn Mawr Classical Review", 1994 (). offers the briefest summaries of lost metamorphoses by more ambitious writers, such as Nicander and Boios|Boeus. Francis Celoria, the translator, regards the text as perfectly acceptable "koine" Greek, though with numerous "hapax legomena"; it is "grimly simple" and mostly devoid of particle (grammar)|grammatical particles which would convey humor or a narratorial persona.Celoria, "The Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis", 2. == Tales ==  # Ctesylla # The Meleagrids # Hierax (mythology)|Hierax # Cragaleus # Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius # Periphas (king of Attica)|Periphas # Anthus (mythology)|Anthus # Lamia (mythology)|Lamia or Sybaris (mythology)|Sybaris # Pierides (mythology)|Emathides # Minyades # Aëdon or Nightingale # Cycnus of Aetolia|Cycnus or Swan # Aspalis # Munichus # Meropis (mythology)|Meropis # Oenoe (mythology)|Oenoe # Leucippus (daughter of Galatea)|Leucippus # Botres|Eeropus or Bee-eater # The Thieves # Clinis # Polyphonte # Cerambus # Battus (mythology)|Battus # Ascalabus # Metioche and Menippe # Hylas # Iphigeneia # Typhon # Galanthis|Galinthias # Byblis # The Messapian shepherds|Messapians # Dryope (daughter of Dryops)|Dryope # Alcmene # Myrrha|Smyrna # The Lycian peasants|Herdsmen # Pandareus # The Dorians # Psamathe (Nereid)|Wolf # Arceophon # Britomartis # The Teumessian fox|Fox  == Footnotes ==  == Notes ==  == References ==  *Celoria, Francis, ed. and trans.
