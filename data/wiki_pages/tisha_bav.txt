Tisha B'Av marks the end of the The Three Weeks|three weeks between dire straits and is regarded as the saddest day in the Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar, and it is thus believed to be a day which is destined for tragedy.  "Tisha B'Av" falls in July or August in the Gregorian calendar. The observance of the day includes #Main prohibitions|five prohibitions, most notable of which is a 25-hour fast. The Book of Lamentations, which mourns the destruction of Jerusalem, is read in the synagogue, followed by the recitation of "kinnot", liturgical dirges that lament the loss of the Temples and Jerusalem. As the day has become associated with remembrance of other major calamities which have befallen the Jewish people, some "kinnot" also recall events such as the murder of the Ten Martyrs by the Romans, Edict of Expulsion|expulsions from England, Expulsion of Jews from Spain|Spain and elsewhere, Rhineland massacres|massacres of numerous medieval Jewish communities during the Crusades, and the Holocaust. ==History==  Image:NinthAvStonesWesternWall.JPG|thumb|right|Excavated stones from the Western Wall of the Temple Mount (Jerusalem, Israel), knocked onto the street below by Roman battering rams in 70 CE According to the Mishnah ("Ta'anit (Talmud)|Taanit" 4:6), five specific events occurred on the ninth of Av that warrant fasting: # The The Twelve Spies|Twelve Spies sent by Moses to observe the land of Canaan returned from their mission. Only two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb, brought a positive report, while the others spoke disparagingly about the land. The majority report caused the Children of Israel to cry, panic and despair of ever entering the "Promised Land". For this, they were punished by Names of God in Judaism|God that their generation would not enter the land.See ; . The midrash quotes God as saying about this event, "You cried before me pointlessly, I will fix for you  crying for the generations",Numbers Rabbah 16:20 alluding to the future misfortunes which occurred on the same date. # The Solomon's Temple|First Temple built by Solomon|King Solomon was Siege of Jerusalem (586 BC)|destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE, and the population of the Kingdom of Judah was sent into the Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile. According to the Bible, the First Temple's destruction began on the 7th of Av (2 Kings 25:8) and continued until the 10th (Jeremiah 52:12). According to the Talmud,Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit 29a the actual destruction of the Temple began on the Ninth of Av, and it continued to burn throughout the Tenth of Av. # The Second Temple built by Ezra and Nehemiah was Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE,Secular chronology gives the year as 70 CE. Some versions of rabbinic chronology give the year as 68 CE. See Missing years (Jewish calendar)#Two-year difference within the Hebrew calendar for elaboration. scattering the people of Judea and commencing the Jewish diaspora|Jewish exile from the Holy Land. # The Romans subsequently crushed Bar Kokhba's revolt and destroyed the city of Betar (fortress)|Betar, killing over 500,000 Jewish civilians (approximately 580,000) on 4 August 135 CE. # Following the Bar Kokhba revolt, Roman commander Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Quintus Tineius Rufus plowed the site of the Temple in Jerusalem and the surrounding area, in 135 CE.  Over time, Tisha B'Av has come to be a Jewish day of mourning, not only for these events, but also for later tragedies which occurred on or near the 9th of Av. References to some of these events appear in liturgy composed for Tisha B'Av (see below). *The Crusades|First Crusade officially commenced on 15 August 1096 (Av 24, AM 4856), Pogroms of 1096|killing 10,000 Jews in its first month and destroying Jewish communities in France and the Rhineland. *The Jews were Edict of Expulsion|expelled from England on 18 July 1290 (Av 9, AM 5050). *The Jews were History of the Jews in France#The Great Exile of 1306|expelled from France on 22 July 1306 (Av 10, AM 5066). *The Jews were Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain on 31 July 1492 (Av 7, AM 5252).. Note that 31 July is the Julian calendar date; corrected for the Gregorian calendar it would be 10 August. *Germany entered World War I on 1–2 August 1914 (Av 9–10, AM 5674), which caused massive upheaval in European Jewry and whose aftermath led to the Holocaust. * On 2 August 1941 (Av 9, AM 5701), SS commander Heinrich Himmler formally received approval from the Nazi Party for "The Final Solution." As a result, the The Holocaust|Holocaust began during which almost one third of the world's Jewish population perished. *On 23 July 1942 (Av 9, AM 5702), began the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto, en route to Treblinka. *The AMIA bombing, of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killed 85 and injured 300 on 18 July 1994 (10 Av, AM 5754). *The 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza. While the Holocaust spanned a number of years, most religious communities use Tisha B'Av to mourn its 6,000,000 Jewish victims, in addition to or instead of the secular Holocaust Memorial Days. On Tisha B'Av, communities which otherwise do not modify the traditional prayer liturgy have added the recitation of special "kinnot" related to the Holocaust.  In connection with the fall of Jerusalem, three other fast-days were established at the same time as the Ninth Day of Av: these were the Tenth of Tevet, when the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians began; the Seventeenth of Tammuz, when the first breach was made in the wall by the Romans; and the Third of Tishrei, known as the Fast of Gedaliah, the day when Gedaliah was assassinated in the time of the Babylonians following the destruction of the First Temple. The three weeks leading up to Tisha B'Av are known as The Three Weeks, while the nine days leading up to Tisha B'Av are known as The Nine Days. ==Laws and customs== File:Woodcut tisha b'av.png|thumb|Tisha b'Av (1657 woodcut) "Tisha B'Av" falls in July or August in the Gregorian calendar. When Tisha B'Av falls on Shabbat (Saturday), it then is known as a  ("delayed") in Hebrew and the observance of Tisha B'Av then takes place on the following day (that is, Sunday). This last occurred in 2022, and will next occur in 2029. No outward signs of mourning intrude upon the normal Sabbath, although normal Sabbath eating and drinking end just before sunset Saturday evening, rather than nightfall. The fast lasts about 25 hours, beginning just before sunset on the preceding evening lasting until nightfall the next day. In addition to fasting, other pleasurable activities are also forbidden.  "Tisha B'Av" bears a similar stringent nature to that of Yom Kippur. In addition to the length of the fast which lasts about 25 hours, beginning just before sunset on the eve of Tisha B'Av and ends at nightfall the following day, Tisha B'Av also shares the following five prohibitions:Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 650:2 #No eating or drinking; #No washing or bathing; #No application of creams or oils; #No wearing of (leather) shoes; #No marital (sexual) relations. These restrictions are waived in the case of health issues but a competent posek, a rabbi who decides Halakha|Jewish Law, must be consulted. For example, those who are seriously ill will be allowed to eat and drink. On other fast days almost any medical condition may justify breaking the fast; in practice, since many cases differ, consultation with a rabbi is often necessary. Ritual washing in Judaism|Ritual washing up to the knuckles is permitted. Washing to cleanse dirt or mud from one's body is also permitted.

In synagogue, prior to the commencement of the evening services, the "parochet" (which normally covers and adorns the Torah Ark) is removed or drawn aside, lasting until the Mincha prayer service. According to the Moses Isserles|Rema it is customary to sit on low stools or on the floor, as is done during "Shiva (Judaism)|shiva", from the meal immediately before the fast (the Seudah#Seudah HaMafseket|seudah hamafseket) until Zmanim#Midday|midday (chatzot hayom) of the fast itself.  It is customary to eat a Boiled egg|hard boiled egg dipped in ashes, and a piece of bread dipped into ashes, during this pre-fast meal.
