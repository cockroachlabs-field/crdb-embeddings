It has its source on the northern slopes of Mount Nero|Mt. Nero, elevation  above sea level, and after a course of about &mdash;the second longest of the province&mdash;flows into the Po River  east of Piacenza, in the vicinity of Roncarolo, a "frazione" of the commune of Caorso, on the border with the Lombardy|Lombard commune of Caselle Landi. The upper valley is somewhat influenced by the sea air, keeping it free of fog and strong winds, and therefore relatively pleasant even during the winter months. In this valley there are 79 fortifications (castles, fortified towers and dwellings, etc.) The main villages along this river are: Ferriere, Bosconure, Cantoniera, Farini d'Olmo, Bettola, Ponte dell'Olio, Vigolzone, Grazzano Visconti, Podenzano. In addition to the main villages, other areas of the Val Nure (Valley of the Nure) are delineated by parishes, with churches located along the peaks of the mountains. One example is Cogno San Bassano, at the top of the mountain above Farini d'Olmo. ==References==   Category:Rivers of Italy Category:Rivers of the Province of Piacenza Category:Rivers of the Apennines
