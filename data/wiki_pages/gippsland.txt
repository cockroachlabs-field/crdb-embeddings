It covers an elongated area of  located further east of the Shire of Cardinia (Melbourne's outermost list of Melbourne suburbs#Southeastern municipalities and their suburbs|southeastern suburbs) between Dandenong Ranges and Mornington Peninsula, and is bounded to the north by the mountain ranges and plateaus/highlands of the Victorian Alps|High Country (which separate it from Hume (region)|Hume region in Victoria's northeast), to the southwest by the Western Port Bay, to the south and east by the Bass Strait and the Tasman Sea, and to the east and northeast by the Black-Allan Line (the easternmost section of the Victoria/New South Wales state border). The Gippsland region is generally divided by the Strzelecki Ranges and tributaries of the Gippsland Lakes into five statistical sub-regions — namely the West Gippsland, South Gippsland, Latrobe Valley, Central Gippsland and East Gippsland.  As at the 2016 Australian census, Gippsland had a population of , with the principal population centres of the region, in descending order of population, , Warragul, Drouin, Victoria|Drouin, Bairnsdale, , Sale, Victoria|Sale, , Wonthaggi, , and Phillip Island. Gippsland is best known for its primary production such as mining, power generation and farming as well as its tourist destinations — Phillip Island (Victoria)|Phillip Island, Wilsons Promontory, the Gippsland Lakes, Walhalla, Victoria|Walhalla, the Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau, and the Strzelecki Ranges. ==History== The traditional owners are Indigenous Australians of the Gunai people|Gunai nation and in part of West Gippsland the Bunurong nation. Before permanent European colonisation, the area was visited by Seal hunting|sealers and acacia|wattle bark gatherers who did not settle. Samuel Anderson (Australian settler)|Samuel Anderson (1803-1863),The Andersons of Westernport "Horton and Morris" 1983 a Scottish immigrant from Kirkcudbright, agriculturist and explorer, arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1830, and in 1835 established a squatter agricultural settlement on the Bass River (Victoria)|Bass River in Gippsland, the third permanent colonial settlement in Victoria (then called the Port Phillip District). His business partner Robert Massie joined him in 1837. Both had worked for the Van Diemen's Land Company at Circular Head, Tasmania. Samuel's brothers Hugh (1808-1898) and Thomas (1814-1903) arrived at Bass shortly after, where they established a successful farming venture. Further European colonisation followed two separate expeditions to the area.   During his expedition to the South (December 1839 - May 1840) in March 1840, Polish explorer Paweł Edmund Strzelecki led an expedition across Gunai people|Gunai country, and gave his own names to many of their natural landmarks and places. Following these expeditions, the name "Gippsland" stuck, a name chosen by Strzelecki in honour of the Governor of New South Wales|New South Wales Governor, George Gipps, his sponsor.Wells, J. (2003), "Colourful Tales of Old Gippsland", p. 92. See also  Angus McMillan led the second European expedition between 1840, naming Gunai people|Gunai country "Caledonia Australis". The naming of this geographical region, however, remained the name given by P. E. Strzelecki - Gippsland The township of Bass, Victoria|Bass was surveyed and colonised in the early 1860s. The intensive colonisation of south Gippsland began late in the 1870s. A story of that process is told in, "The land of the Lyre Bird" (1920)."The land of the Lyre Bird: a story of early settlement in the Great South Forest of South Gippsland; being a description of the big scrub in its virgin state with its birds and animals, and of the adventures and hardships of its early explorers and prospectors also accounts by the settlers of clearing, settlement and development of the country", Gordon & Gotch for the Committee of the South Gippsland Pioneers Association, Melbourne, 1920 (reprinted 1966). Gippsland will serve as one of the hosts for the 2026 Commonwealth Games in regional Victoria. ==Geography== }} Image:East Gippsland old growth 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|Old growth forests in East Gippsland Gippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main subregions or districts: *West Gippsland (roughly equivalent to the Baw Baw Shire) *South Gippsland (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires) *the Latrobe Valley (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north) *East Gippsland (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland). *Sometimes a fifth region, Central Gippsland (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the Gippsland Lakes and Yarram. Gippsland Plains Grassy Woodland is an endangered vegetation community within the region. ==Climate==  File:VM 0267 Stratford - Avon River valley.jpg|thumb|On the Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River near Stratford, Victoria|Stratford The climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around Sale, Victoria|Sale, where annual rainfall averages around .Australia, Bureau of Meteorology, Summary statistics EAST SALE, http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_085072.shtml, retrieved 02/07/2020 In the Strzelecki Ranges annual rainfall can be as high as , while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels – much of it falling as snow. In lower levels east of the Snowy River, mean annual rainfall is typically about  and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from  in January to  in July. In the highlands of the Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau and the remote Errinundra National Park|Errinundra Plateau, temperatures range from a maximum of  to a minimum of . However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as , leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October. ==Natural resources==   Image:Potato field through fence - Thorpdale.JPG|thumb|Potato farming in the Thorpdale, Victoria|Thorpdale region The soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being profoundly deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium. Apart from frequently flooded areas, they are classed as Spodosols, Psamments and Ultisols. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development. Despite this, parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the Monaro Tableland used for grazing cattle|beef cattle. Gippsland possesses very few deposits of metallic minerals (gold rushes in the nineteenth century around Foster, Victoria|Foster, Buchan, Victoria|Buchan petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty-year period between 1863 and 1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world's largest brown coal deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the Bass Strait, some of the largest deposits of Petroleum|oil and natural gas in Australia. Like the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no upwelling due to the warm currents in the Tasman Sea. Nonetheless, towns such as Marlo, Victoria|Marlo and Mallacoota depended for a long time on the fishing of abalone, whose gastropod shell|shells could fetch very high prices because of their use for pearls and pearl inlays. == Administration ==  For Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections for the Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives, the electoral divisions of Division of Flinders|Flinders, Division of Monash|Monash, and Division of Gippsland|Gippsland lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region. Flinders and McMillan are currently held by the Liberal Party, while Gippsland is held by the Nationals. For elections for the Legislative Assembly of Victoria|Victorian Legislative Assembly, the electoral districts of Electoral district of Bass|Bass, Electoral district of Narracan|Narracan, Electoral district of Morwell|Morwell, Electoral district of Gippsland South|Gippsland South and Electoral district of Gippsland East|Gippsland East lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region. Bass is held by Labor, Narracan is held by the Liberals while Gippsland East and Gippsland South are held by the Nationals. The remaining seat, Morwell, is held by Russell Northe, an independent who was originally elected as a Nationals MP. = Gippsland contains six Local government in Australia|local government areas: {| class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" |+ Gippsland region LGA populations |- ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Local government in Australia|Local government area ! scope="col" colspan="2" | Area ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Population<br />(Census in Australia#2011|2011 census) ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Source(s) ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Population<br />(2016 Australian census|2016 census) ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Source(s) |- ! scope="col" | km<sup>2</sup> ! scope="col" | sq mi |- | scope="row" | Bass Coast Shire |  | align="right" |  | | align="right" |  | |- | scope="row" | Shire of Baw Baw |  | align="right" |  |{{Census 2011 AUS|id=LGA20830| ...
