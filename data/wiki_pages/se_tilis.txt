  File:Sousse mosaic calendar August.JPG|thumb|August panel from a Roman mosaic of the months (from El Djem, Tunisia, first half of 3rd century AD) "Sextilis" ("sixth") or ""mensis Sextilis"" was the Latin name for what was originally the sixth month in the Roman calendar, when March ("Martius (month)|Martius", "Mars (mythology)|Mars' month") was the first of ten months in the year. After the calendar reform that produced a twelve-month year, Sextilis became the eighth month, but retained its name. It was renamed ""Augustus"" (August) in 8&nbsp;BCCensorinus, "De die natali" 22.16 (). in honor of the first Roman emperor, Augustus. Sextilis followed Quinctilis, which was renamed "Julius" (July) after Julius Caesar, and preceded September (Roman month)|September (from "septem", "seven"), which was originally the seventh month. ==The month "Augustus"== "Quintilis|Julius" (July) was renamed from "Quintilis" ("fifth" month) in honor of Julius Caesar, who had adopted his grand-nephew Octavian, the future Augustus, and made him his heir.  It has sometimes been thought that the month has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days in his month as in his predecessor's, but Sextilis in fact had 31 days since the reform during Caesar's Roman dictator|dictatorship that created the Julian calendar. The decree of the Roman senate|Senate "(senatus consultum)" renaming Sextilis reads in part: File:Chronography of 354 Mensis Augustus.png|thumb|upright|left|Illustration taken from the 4th-century Calendar of Filocalus <blockquote>Whereas the emperor Augustus Caesar, in the month of Sextilis, was first admitted to the Roman consul|consulate, and thrice entered the city in Roman triumph|triumph, and in the same month the Roman legion|legions, from the Janiculum, placed themselves under his auspices, and in the same month Roman Egypt|Egypt was brought under the authority of the Roman people, and in the same month an end was put to the civil wars; and whereas for these reasons the said month is, and has been, most fortunate to this empire, it is hereby decreed by the senate that the said month shall be called Augustus.Preserved by Macrobius, "Saturnalia" 1.12.35; entry on "calendarium", in William Smith, "A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities" (John Murray, London, 1875), at </blockquote> ==Iconography of the month== The Calendar of Filocalus illustrated the month of August with a seasonal representation of summer's heat. A peacock fan overhangs a nude male who drinks from a large bowl, with his cast-off garment in the top right corner. The amphora beside him is sealed with a flower and in one extant copy is inscribed "ZLS", probably a mistaken transcription for the Greek exhortation "zeses", "to your health". Three mature gourds or melons are another seasonal motif.Michele Renee Salzman, "On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity" (University of California Press, 1990), p. 94. ==Dates== File:SMWM - Römischer Dachziegel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Roof tile with a Latin inscription reading "XVI KALENDAS SEPTEMBRES ISAURICUS": "XVI Kal. Sept." is 17 August on the Julian calendar The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the Nones (calendar)|Nones (5th or 7th, depending on the length of the month), the Ides (calendar)|Ides (13th or 15th), and the Kalends (1st) of the following month. The Nones of August was the 5th, and the Ides the 13th. The last day of August was the "pridie Kalendas Septembris,"The month name is construed as an adjective modifying "Kalendae," "Nonae" or "Idūs" (all plural nouns of grammatical gender|feminine gender). "day before the Kalends of September". Roman counting was inclusive counting|inclusive; 9 August was "ante diem V Idūs Sextilīs" ("ante diem V Idūs Augustas"), "the 5th day before the Ides of August," usually abbreviated "a.d. V Id. Sext." ("a.d. V Id. Aug."), or with the "a.d." omitted altogether. The Julian calendar reform added two days to Sextilis; thus on the pre-reform calendar, 23 August was "VIII Kal. Sept.", "the 8th day before the Kalends of September," but on the Julian calendar "X Kal. Sept.", "the 10th day before the Kalends of September". On the calendar of the Roman Republic and early Principate, each day was marked with a letter to denote its religiously lawful status. In August, these were: * "F" for "Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fasti|dies fasti", days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of Roman law|civil law; * "C", for "dies comitalis," a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies "(comitia)", elections, and certain kinds of judicial proceedings; * "N" for "Glossary of ancient Roman religion#nefastus|dies nefasti", when these political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited; * "NP", the meaning of which remains elusive, but which marked "Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae", public holidays; * "EN" for "endotercissus", an Old Latin|archaic form of "intercissus", "cut in half," meaning days that were "nefasti" in the morning, when sacrifice in ancient Roman religion|sacrifices were being prepared, and in the evening, while sacrifices were being offered, but were "fasti" in the middle of the day.Scullard, "Festivals and Ceremonies," pp. 44–45.

Richardson (Blackwell, 2011, originally published 1995 in German), p. 6. (these are omitted in the table below). A "Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis" was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication, sometimes thought of as the "birthday" of a deity. During the Roman Empire|Imperial period, some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. On the calendar of military religious observances known as the "Feriale Duranum", sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals. After the mid-1st century AD, a number of dates are added to calendars for Roman Empire#Recreation and spectacles|spectacles and games "(ludi circenses|circenses)" held in honor of various deities in the venue called a "circus (building)|circus".Salzman, "On Roman Time", p. 118ff. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with letters "(F, N, C" and so on) to show their religious status, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius.Salzman, "On Roman Time", pp. 17, 122. Festivals marked in large letters on extant "fasti", represented by festival names in all capital letters on the table, are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC.Scullard,  "Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic", p. 41. Unless otherwise noted, the dating and observances on the following table are from H.H. Scullard, "Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic" (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp.&nbsp;169–182. After the Ides, dates are given for the Julian calendar, with pre-Julian dates noted parenthetically for festivals. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Modern<br>date !! Roman date !! status !!
