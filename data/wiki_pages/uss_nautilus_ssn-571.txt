Her initial commanding officer was Eugene Parks Wilkinson|Eugene "Dennis" Wilkinson, a widely respected naval officer who set the stage for many of the protocols of today's Nuclear Navy of the US, and who had a storied career during military service and afterwards.Winters, Ann (28 March 2017). "Underway on Nuclear Power" -- The Man Behind the Words: Eugene P. "Dennis" Wilkinson, Vice Admiral USN. The American Nuclear Society. Sharing a name with Captain Nemo's Nautilus (fictional submarine)|fictional submarine in Jules Verne's classic 1870 science fiction novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" and the  that served with distinction in World War II, the new nuclear-powered "Nautilus" was authorized in 1951. Construction began in 1952, and the boat was launched in January 1954, sponsored by Mamie Eisenhower, First Lady of the United States, wife of 34th President Dwight D. Eisenhower; it was commissioned the following September into the United States Navy. "Nautilus" was delivered to the Navy in 1955. Because her nuclear propulsion allowed her to remain submerged far longer than diesel-electric submarines, she broke many records in her first years of operation and traveled to locations previously beyond the limits of submarines. In operation, she revealed a number of limitations in her design and construction. This information was used to improve subsequent submarines. "Nautilus" was decommissioned in 1980 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. The submarine has been preserved as a museum ship at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, where the vessel receives around 250,000 visitors per year. ==Planning and construction== File:Hyman Rickover inspecting USS Nautilus.jpg|thumb|Admiral Hyman G.

Rickover, USN, known as the "Father of the Nuclear Navy." On 12 December 1951, the United States Department of the Navy|US Department of the Navy announced that the submarine would be called "Nautilus", the fourth U.S. Navy vessel officially USS Nautilus|so named.  The boat carried the Hull classification symbol|hull number SSN-571. She benefited from the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program|Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) improvements to the United States|American Gato class submarine|"Gato"-, Balao class submarine|"Balao"-, and Tench class submarine|"Tench"-class submarines. File:nautilus core.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"Nautilus"s reactor core prototype at the S1W facility in Idaho "Nautilus"s keel was laid at General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division in Groton, Connecticut, by Harry S. Truman on 14 June 1952. She was ship naming and launching|christened on 21 January 1954 and launched into the Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River, sponsored by Mamie Eisenhower. "Nautilus" was ship commissioning|commissioned on 30 September 1954, under the command of Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, USN. "Nautilus" was powered by the Submarine Thermal Reactor (STR), later redesignated the S2W reactor, a pressurized water reactor produced for the US Navy by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, operated by Westinghouse, developed the basic reactor plant design used in "Nautilus" after being given the assignment on 31 December 1947 to design a nuclear power plant for a submarine. Nuclear power had a crucial advantage in submarine propulsion because it is a zero-emission process that consumes no air. This design is the basis for nearly all of the US nuclear-powered submarine and surface combat ships, and was adapted by other countries for naval nuclear propulsion. The first actual prototype (for "Nautilus") was constructed and tested by the Argonne National Laboratory in 1953 at S1W reactor|S1W at the Naval Reactors Facility, part of the Idaho National Laboratory|National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho. "Nautilus" ship's patch was designed by The Walt Disney Company, and her wardroom currently displays a set of tableware made of zirconium#Nuclear applications|zirconium, as the nuclear fuel cladding was partly made of zirconium. =="Underway on nuclear power"== Following her commissioning, "Nautilus" remained dockside for further construction and testing.  On the morning of 17 January 1955, at 11 am EST, "Nautilus" first Commanding Officer, Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, ordered all lines cast off and signaled the memorable and historic message, "Underway on nuclear power."  On 10 May, she headed south for shakedown cruise|shakedown. Submerged throughout, she traveled  from Naval Submarine Base New London|New London to San Juan, Puerto Rico and covered  in less than ninety hours<!--(sources differ: 84 hours or 89.8 hours) (I am fact-checking this with USN historian at Groton's Submarine Force Library and Museum --User:Pedant)--><!--Since this is a speed of advance of only 13.33 knots, it's entirely believable --User:RobDuch-->. At the time, this was the longest submerged cruise by a submarine and at the highest sustained speed (for at least one hour) ever recorded. File:SS-571-Nautilus-trials.gif|thumb|USS "Nautilus" during its initial sea trials, 20 January 1955 From 1955 to 1957, "Nautilus" continued to be used to investigate the effects of increased submerged speeds and endurance. These improvements rendered the progress made in anti-submarine warfare during World War II virtually obsolete. Radar and maritime patrol aircraft|anti-submarine aircraft, which had proved crucial in defeating submarines during the war, proved ineffective against a vessel able to move quickly out of an area, change depth quickly and stay submerged for very long periods.Friedman, Submarines, pp 109 On 4 February 1957, "Nautilus" logged her 60,000th nautical mile (), matching the endurance of her namesake, the fictional Nautilus (Verne)|"Nautilus" described in Jules Verne's novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea". In May, she departed for the Pacific Coast to participate in coastal exercises and the fleet exercise, operation "Home Run," which acquainted units of the Pacific Fleet with the capabilities of nuclear submarines. File:GWBridgeUSSNautilus.agr.jpg|thumb|"Nautilus" passes under the George Washington Bridge during a visit to New York Harbor in 1956 "Nautilus" returned to New London, Connecticut, on 21 July and departed again on 19 August for her first voyage of  under the polar pack ice. Thereafter, she headed for the Eastern Atlantic to participate in NATO Operation Strikeback|exercises and conduct a tour of various British and French ports where she was inspected by defense personnel of those countries. She arrived back at New London on 28 October, underwent upkeep, and then conducted coastal operations until the spring.  In response to the nuclear ICBM threat posed by Sputnik, President Eisenhower ordered the U.S. Navy to attempt a submarine transit of the North Pole to gain credibility for the soon-to-come SLBM weapons system. On 25 April 1958, "Nautilus" was underway again for the West Coast, now commanded by Commander William Anderson (naval officer)|William R. Anderson, USN. Stopping at San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, she began her history-making polar transit, "Operation Sunshine (USS Nautil ...
