They have two dorsal fins and are notable for scales covering the soft parts of the dorsal and anal fins. The eyes are large. The gnomefish, "S. boops", lives in deep rocky areas, down to 400 m.  It can grow to 150&nbsp;cm total length and 16&nbsp;kg weight. "S. gilberti" occurs in the western Pacific including Japan. The Atlantic scombrops, "S. oculatus", is widely found in the subtropical western Atlantic, particularly the Florida and Bahamas area.  It is a deepwater fish, caught by anglers between 200 and 610 m. ==Species== The following species are classified within the genus "Scombrops": *"Scombrops boops" <small>(Martinus Houttuyn|Houttuyn, 1782)</small> * "Scombrops gilberti" <small>(David Starr Jordan|Jordan & John Otterbein Snyder|Snyder, 1901)</small> * "Scombrops oculatus" <small>(Felipe Poey|Poey, 1860)</small> The Scombropidae have been put forward as the sister taxon to the Pempheridae by some authorities. == References ==   Category:Scombropidae Category:Extant Eocene first appearances
