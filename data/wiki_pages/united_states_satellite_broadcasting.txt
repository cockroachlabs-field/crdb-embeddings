It was absorbed into DirecTV in 1999. ==History== USSB was founded in 1981 by Hubbard Broadcasting Corporation|Hubbard Broadcasting President Stanley S. Hubbard, who is widely considered to be the father of modern satellite broadcasting.  Hubbard spent most of the 1980s raising awareness and money to launch a digital satellite television service.  In the 1990s, he had teamed up with Technicolor SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics and Hughes Electronics to come up with a practical digital satellite service capable of 175 channels. The original name of the service was "HUBTV", named after Hubbard, but was soon changed to "USSB". Other key early executives were his sons Stanley E. Hubbard, II and Robert Hubbard, as well as Paul Heinersheid, and Bernard Weiss. When the service launched, USSB offered a comparatively small slate of channels, but included almost all of the major American premium channels and any channel in which Viacom International|Viacom had a stake at the time (which included the MTV Networks). Lacking any news channels, Hubbard instead used its in-house All News Channel, operated as a cooperative of Viacom and Hubbard-owned stations, as well as stations owned by other groups via the CONUS satellite network Hubbard operated. Hughes offered programming from most other cable television channels under the banner of DirecTV; viewers used the same satellite equipment, branded as the Digital Satellite Service|DSS (Digital Satellite System), to access both services (with USSB's channel lineup starting in the 900s range). Though it wasn't a requirement to subscribe to both services, many did, resulting in customers receiving two separate bills. On March 10, 1998, the Viacom channels (excluding the Showtime (TV network)|Showtime networks) moved to DirecTV while USSB added Fox Movie Channel|fXM and Showtime Extreme to its lineup. Ultimately, the service was too small to succeed, with DirecTV outpacing it in channel capacity and marketing; an additional snag came when the DSS trademark was relinquished by DirecTV in a legal dispute. The Hubbards sold USSB to Hughes in December 1998, with only some employees transferring to DirecTV's El Segundo, CA headquarters and Castle Rock, CO uplink center from USSB's headquarters and uplink facility in St. Paul, MN; the channel lineup of USSB was integrated into DirecTV's lineup by mid-1999. ==Channels== *HBO East **HBO West **HBO2 East **HBO2 West **HBO Signature **HBO Family East **HBO Family West *Showtime (TV network)|Showtime East **Showtime (TV network)|Showtime West **Showtime (TV network)|Showtime 2 **Showtime (TV network)|Showtime 3 **Showtime (TV network)|Showtime Extreme *Cinemax East **Cinemax West **MoreMax *The Movie Channel East **The Movie Channel West *Comedy Central *MTV *MTV2 *Nickelodeon *VH1 *TV Land *Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel *Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime *All News Channel *Flix (TV network)|Flix *Fox Movie Channel|fXM *Big Events (two PPV channels) **Pay-per-view#HBO PPV|TVKO (HBO's PPV arm at the time) **SET (Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's PPV arm) *Channel 999 (previews) ==References==         **  1997-1999 only     Category:Direct broadcast satellite services Category:Hubbard Broadcasting Category:Technology companies disestablished in 1999 Category:Defunct telecommunications companies of the United States Category:Defunct television broadcasting companies of the United States Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1981 Category:American companies established in 1981 Category:1981 establishments in Minnesota Category:1999 disestablishments in Minnesota
