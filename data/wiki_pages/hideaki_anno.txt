He is best known for creating the anime series "Neon Genesis Evangelion" (1995)"." His style is defined by his postmodernist approach and the extensive portrayal of characters' thoughts and emotions, often through unconventional scenes presenting the mental deconstruction of those characters. The Neon Genesis Evangelion (franchise)|"Evangelion" franchise has had a significant influence on the anime television industry and Japanese popular culture, with many deeming Anno as one of the medium's first auteurs. Anno's other directorial works include "Daicon Film's Return of Ultraman" (1983), "Gunbuster" (1988), "Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water" (1990), "Kare Kano" (1998), "Love & Pop" (1998), "Shiki-Jitsu" (2000), "Cutie Honey (film)|Cutie Honey" (2004), "Re: Cutie Honey" (2004), "Rebuild of Evangelion" (2007–2021), and "Shin Godzilla" (2016), the latter film marking the beginning of the "Shin" trilogy of "tokusatsu" franchise Reboot (fiction)|reboots with Shinji Higuchi, followed by "Shin Ultraman" (2022) and "Shin Kamen Rider (film)|Shin Kamen Rider" (2023). Several of Anno's anime have won the "Animage" Anime Grand Prix award, including "Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water" in 1990, "Neon Genesis Evangelion" in 1995 and 1996, and "The End of Evangelion" in 1997. ==Biography==  The son of Fumiko and Takuya Anno, Anno was born in Ube, Yamaguchi; he attended Wakō Kindergarten, Unoshima Municipal Elementary School, Fujiyama Municipal Junior High School, and Yamaguchi Prefectural Ube High School where he was noted for his interest in artwork and making short films for Japanese Cultural Festivals.  File:Nausicaa god warrior.png|thumb|left|The God Warrior from "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind", which Anno animated. Anno began his career while attending Osaka University of Arts as an animator for the anime series "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross" (1982&ndash;1983). Wrapped up in producing the DAICON III and IV Opening Animations with his fellow students, and also busy making self-financed films, Anno stopped paying his tuition, eventually getting expelled from Osaka University of Arts. He did not gain recognition until the release of his work on Hayao Miyazaki's 1984 in film|1984 film "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind". Running short on animators, the film's production studio posted an ad in the famous Japanese animation magazine Animage, announcing that they were in desperate need of more animators. Anno, in his early twenties at the time, read the ad and headed down to the film's studio, where he met with Miyazaki and showed him some of his drawings. Impressed with his ability, Miyazaki hired him to draw some of the most complicated scenes near the end of the movie,Studio Ghibli, "The Birth of Studio Ghibli" video, Wiktionary:circa|c. 2003 (included on UK Nausicaä DVD) and valued his work highly. Anno went on to become one of the co-founders of Gainax in December 1984. He worked as an animation director for their first feature-length film, "Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise" (1987), and ultimately became Gainax's premiere anime director, leading the majority of the studio's projects such as "Gunbuster" (1988) and "Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water" (1990&ndash;1991). However, Anno fell into a four-year depression (mood)|depression following "Nadia" — the series was handed down to him from NHK from an original concept by Hayao Miyazaki (of which "Castle in the Sky" is also partly based upon) and he was given little creative control. In 1994, the minor planet 9081 Hideakianno was named after him by his old friend Akimasa Nakamura.   Anno's next project was the anime television series "Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion" (1995&ndash;1996). The series is set in a post-apocalyptic futurist version of Tokyo and follows humanity's struggle to survive against an onslaught of giant monsters known as Angels. Anno's history of Major depressive disorder|clinical depression was the main source for many of the psychological elements of the series and its characters, as he wrote down on paper several of the trials and tribulations of his condition. During the show's production, Anno became disenchanted with the Japanese "otaku" lifestyle. For this and other reasons (although perhaps by design as well), "Evangelion"s plot became increasingly dark and psychological as the series progressed, despite being broadcast in a children's television timeslot. Anno felt that people should be exposed to the realities of life at as young an age as possible, and by the end of the series all attempts at traditional narrative logic were abandoned, as the final two episodes take place within the main character's mind. The show did not garner high ratings in Japan at its initial time slot, but after being moved to a later, more adult-oriented venue, it gained considerable popularity. Timing constraints at Gainax also forced Anno to replace the planned ending of "Evangelion" with two episodes set in the main characters' minds. In 1997, Gainax launched a project to re-adapt "Evangelion"s scrapped ending into a feature-length film. Budgeting issues left the film unfinished, and the completed 27 minutes of animation were included as the second act of "Evangelion: Death and Rebirth". In response, Anno received several letters both of encouragement and criticism. Eventually, the project culminated in "The End of Evangelion", a three-act film that served as a finale to "Neon Genesis Evangelion". In September 1999, Anno appeared on the NHK TV-documentary "Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Senpai!", answering some "Evangelion"-related questions, including the origin of the name "Evangelion", and teaching children about animation production. Anno wrote and directed "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time" (2021), launched in March 2021, after being rescheduled twice due to COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that Shinji's story was completed, but mentioned that he had more ideas set in "Evangelion"<nowiki/>'s world.  File:Hideaki Anno and Ryusuke Hikawa 20141030 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anno with Ryūsuke Hikawa. (October 30, 2014) After "Evangelion", Anno directed the 1998 anime series "Kare Kano|Kareshi Kanojo no Jijō" ("Kare Kano" for short, also known in English as "His and Her Circumstances"), the first Gainax television series to be directly adapted from previously written material. During the production of "Kare Kano", Anno became frustrated with the restrictions placed on the show by TV Tokyo after the Dennō Senshi Porygon|Pokémon seizure incident and has not directed television anime since then. The director has also made forays into live-action films, beginning with "Love & Pop" (1998), a cinéma vérité-style film about enjo kosai ("compensated dating", a form of teenage prostitution) in Japan, of which a major portion was shot on miniature digital cameras with constantly shifting aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios. He won Best New Director Award at 1998 Yokohama Film Festival for the film. Asumi Miwa who played the lead role won Best New Talent award respectively. He and his friend Masayuki (animator)|Masayuki also directed the documentary "GAMERA1999" which documented the production of "Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris". His second live-action film, "Shiki-Jitsu" (2000) (""Ritual Day"" or ""Ceremonial Day""), is the story of a burnt-out former animation director (played by popular independent film|indie director Shunji Iwai) who falls in love with a woman disconnected from reality. Though an experimental work like "Love & Pop", this film was shot using the more traditional 2.35:1 aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio and has a generally more polished presentation, eschewing the cinéma vérité grittiness of Anno's first live-action film. This movie earned him Best Artistic Contribution Award at Tokyo International Film Festival and very positive reviews. Anno's third live-action film was "Cutie Honey (film)|Cutie Honey", based on Go Nagai's Cutie Honey|1973 manga and anime series. Released in the summer of 2004, this lighthearted fantasy/superhero film was a stark contrast to his earlier, more realist live-action works.  Later in 2004, Anno supervised but did not direct the three-part OVA, "Re: Cutie Honey", which was respectively directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (part 1), Takamichi Itō (part 2), and Masayuki (part 3). Also released in 2004 was the movie , in which Anno makes several acting cameos: as the student in the front row of the "Home Room!" skit sitting next to Hataru, in "Who's the Director?" as an animator who feels he is being overworked, and finally in "Singles Picnic" he is among the men awaiting females who never come. On August 1, 2006, Hideaki Anno's official website was updated with job listings for key animators and production staff at a company he founded, Studio Khara. In September 2006, Anno's departure from Gainax was reported in the October edition of the Japanese animation magazine "Newtype".  On September 9, 2006, GAINAX's official website confirmed that "Rebuild of Evangelion" was in the works. The first three movies would be an alternate retelling of the TV series (including many new scenes, settings, backgrounds, characters), and the fourth movie would be a completely new conclusion to the story.  Kazuya Tsurumaki and Masayuki would direct the movies while Yoshiyuki Sadamoto would provide character designs and Ikuto Yamash ...
