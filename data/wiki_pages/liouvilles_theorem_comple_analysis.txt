  In complex analysis, "Liouville's theorem", named after Joseph Liouville (although the theorem was first proven by Cauchy in 1844), states that every bounded function|bounded entire function must be Constant function|constant. That is, every holomorphic function <math>f</math> for which there exists a positive number <math>M</math> such that <math>|f(z)| \leq M</math> for all <math>z</math> in <math>\Complex</math> is constant. Equivalently, non-constant holomorphic functions on <math>\Complex</math> have unbounded images. The theorem is considerably improved by Picard theorem|Picard's little theorem, which says that every entire function whose image omits two or more complex numbers must be constant. == Proof == This important theorem has several proofs. A standard analytical proof uses the fact that Proof that holomorphic functions are analytic|holomorphic functions are analytic.  \,d\zeta</math> and "C<sub>r</sub>" is the circle about 0 of radius "r" > 0. Suppose "f" is bounded: i.e. there exists a constant "M" such that <math>|f(z)| \leq M</math> for all "z". We can estimate directly <math>| a_k |  \le \frac{1}{2 \pi} \oint_{C_r} \frac{ | f ( \zeta ) | }{ | \zeta |^{k+1} } \, |d\zeta| \le \frac{1}{2 \pi} \oint_{C_r} \frac{ M }{ r^{k+1} } \, |d\zeta| = \frac{M}{2 \pi r^{k+1}} \oint_{C_r} |d\zeta| = \frac{M}{2 \pi r^{k+1}} 2 \pi r = \frac{M}{r^k},</math> where in the second inequality we have used the fact that <math>|z|=r</math> on the circle "C"<sub>"r"</sub>. But the choice of "r" in the above is an arbitrary positive number. Therefore, letting "r" tend to infinity (we let "r" tend to infinity since f is analytic on the entire plane) gives "a"<sub>"k"</sub> = 0 for all "k" ≥ 1. Thus "f"("z") = "a"<sub>0</sub> and this proves the theorem. }} Another proof uses the mean value property of harmonic functions. |drop=hidden|proof= Given two points, choose two balls with the given points as centers and of equal radius.  If the radius is large enough, the two balls will coincide except for an arbitrarily small proportion of their volume. Since f is bounded, the averages of it over the two balls are arbitrarily close, and so f assumes the same value at any two points.   }} The proof can be adapted to the case where the harmonic function f is merely bounded above or below. See Harmonic function#Liouville's theorem. == Corollaries ==  There is a short Fundamental theorem of algebra#Complex-analytic proofs|proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra based upon Liouville's theorem.  A consequence of the theorem is that "genuinely different" entire functions cannot dominate each other, i.e. if "f" and "g" are entire, and |"f"|&nbsp;≤&nbsp;|"g"| everywhere, then "f"&nbsp;=&nbsp;α·"g" for some complex number α. Consider that for "g" = 0 the theorem is trivial so we assume <math>g\neq 0.</math> Consider the function "h"&nbsp;=&nbsp;"f"/"g". It is enough to prove that "h" can be extended to an entire function, in which case the result follows by Liouville's theorem. The holomorphy of "h" is clear except at points in "g"<sup>−1</sup>(0). But since "h" is bounded and all the zeroes of "g" are isolated, any singularities must be removable. Thus "h" can be extended to an entire bounded function which by Liouville's theorem implies it is constant.  Suppose that "f" is entire and |"f"("z")| is less than or equal to "M"|"z"|, for "M" a positive real number. We can apply Cauchy's integral formula; we have that :<math>|f'(z)|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\oint_{C_r}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^2}d\zeta\right|\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{C_r} \frac{|f(\zeta)|}{\left|(\zeta-z)^2\right|} |d \zeta|\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{C_r} \frac{M |\zeta|}{\left| (\zeta-z)^2\right|} \left|d\zeta\right|=\frac{MI}{2\pi}</math> where "I" is the value of the remaining integral. This shows that "f′" is bounded and entire, so it must be constant, by Liouville's theorem. Integrating then shows that "f" is Affine transformation|affine and then, by referring back to the original inequality, we have that the constant term is zero.  The theorem can also be used to deduce that the domain of a non-constant elliptic function "f" cannot be <math>\Complex.</math> Suppose it was. Then, if "a" and "b" are two periods of "f" such that  is not real, consider the parallelogram "P" whose Vertex (geometry)|vertices are 0, "a", "b" and "a"&nbsp;+&nbsp;"b". Then the image of "f" is equal to "f"("P"). Since "f" is continuous functions|continuous and "P" is Compact space|compact, "f"("P") is also compact and, therefore, it is bounded. So, "f" is constant. The fact that the domain of a non-constant elliptic function "f" can not be <math>\Complex</math> is what Liouville actually proved, in 1847, using the theory of elliptic functions. In fact, it was Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy who proved Liouville's theorem.  If "f" is a non-constant entire function, then its image is Dense set|dense in <math>\Complex.</math> This might seem to be a much stronger result than Liouville's theorem, but it is actually an easy corollary. If the image of "f" is not dense, then there is a complex number "w" and a real number "r" &nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that the open disk centered at "w" with radius "r" has no element of the image of "f". Define  :<math>g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - w}.</math> Then "g" is a bounded entire function, since for all , :<math>|g(z)|=\frac{1}{|f(z)-w|} < \frac{1}{r}.</math> So, "g" is constant, and therefore "f" is constant. == On compact Riemann surfaces == Any holomorphic function on a compact space|compact Riemann surface is necessarily constant.a concise course in complex analysis and Riemann surfaces, Wilhelm Schlag, corollary 4.8, p.77 http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~schlag/bookweb.pdf  Let <math>f(z)</math> be holomorphic on a compact Riemann surface <math>M</math>. By compactness, there is a point <math>p_0 \in M</math> where <math>|f(p)|</math> attains its maximum. Then we can find a chart from a neighborhood of <math>p_0</math> to the unit disk <math>\mathbb{D}</math> such that <math>f(\phi^{-1}(z))</math> is holomorphic on the unit disk and has a maximum at <math>\phi(p_0) \in \mathbb{D}</math>, so it is constant, by the maximum modulus principle. == Remarks == Let <math>\Complex \cup \{\infty\}</math> be the one point compactification of the complex plane <math>\Complex.</math> In place of holomorphic functions defined on regions in <math>\Complex</math>, one can consider regions in <math>\Complex \cup \{\infty\}.</math> Viewed this way, the only possible singularity for entire functions, defined on <math>\Complex \subset \Complex \cup \{\infty\},</math> is the point . If an entire function  is bounded in a neighborhood of , then  is a removable singularity of , i.e.  cannot blow up or behave erratically at . In light of the power series expansion, it is not surprising that Liouville's theorem holds. Similarly, if an entire function has a Pole (complex analysis)|pole of order  at &mdash;that is, it grows in magnitude comparably to  in some neighborhood of &mdash;then  is a polynomial. This extended version of Liouville's theorem can be more precisely stated: if  ≤ "M"}} for }} sufficiently large, then  is a polynomial of degree at most . This can be proved as follows. Again take the Taylor series representation of , :<math> f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k z^k.</math> The argument used during the proof using Cauchy estimates shows that for all , :<math>|a_k| \leq Mr^{n-k}.</math> So, if , then :<math>|a_k| \leq \lim_{r\to\infty}Mr^{n-k} = 0.</math> Therefore, .
