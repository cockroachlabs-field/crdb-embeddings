Representing the company's foray into the executive car scene, it was developed as a result of the successes of the turbocharged 99 and 900 models. The 9000 remained in production until May 1998 and it was replaced by the Saab 9-5 in late 1997, although some final cars were produced into 1998. The Saab 9000 was only available with petrol engines, as 5-door hatchback or 4-door notchback and never as a convertible (except for one prototype) or a Coupé. Saab designed the 9000 as part of the Type Four platform in conjunction with the Italian automaker Fiat Automobiles. Fiat retailed similar derivative versions as the more basic Fiat Croma, the luxury-themed Lancia Thema, and the sports-oriented Alfa Romeo 164. Unlike the 164, which shares only the chassis, the Croma and Thema are outwardly similar to the 9000. As such, much of the bodywork appeared interchangeable between the 9000, Croma and Thema; for example, the doors. However, because Saab fitted heavier side impact protection they will not fit.#Lund (2009)|Lund (2009), p. 77. Also the front of the Saab is radically different from the Italian siblings due to the much improved crash protection. Only seven parts are actually interchangeable. The 9000's body was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and Saab designer Björn Envall. Despite being shorter overall than the Saab 900|900 which was still produced in parallel, the 9000 has a longer wheelbase and greater interior space with 123-cu.ft. of interior space (23.5-cu.ft. in the trunk, 56.5-cu.ft. with rear seats folded), qualifying as an EPA-rated “Full-size car|large car", a distinction shared only with the contemporary Rolls-Royce in America. This was achieved by installing the engine transversely to the direction of travel in the Saab 9000 (instead longitudinally as in the Saab 900). Unlike the Saab 900|900 the 9000 kept the ignition switch in the more conventional steering column position rather than between the front seats. The inspiration for the seats was taken by Björn Envall from The Muppet Show's "Pigs in Space", a sketch by the late puppeteer Jim Henson. In total, 503,087 Saab 9000s were manufactured.#Lund (2009)|Lund (2009), p. 78. These are divided into: 216,385 Saab 9000 CC (MY 1985-1991) 174,525 Saab 9000 CS (MY 1992-1998) 112,177 Saab 9000 CD (MY 1988-1997)  == History ==  The 9000 was launched to the motoring press at a conference at Kolmården Wildlife Park|Kolmården Game Park on 24 May 1984 and 1985 in the European market. This original model called "Saab 9000 Turbo 16" and was a five-door liftback, only available with manual gearbox and the 2.0 turbo engine with 16 valves (producing 129 kw/173&nbsp;hp DIN without cat and already known from the Saab 900). Drag coefficient|Drag resistance for the original model is C<sub>d</sub> 0.34, very competitive for the time.#AG125|Renaux, p. 25 The Saab 9000 was awarded Best Prestige Car 1985 by the French magazine L’Action Automobile. At the end of 1985 (with cars of MY 1986) the 9000 was rolled out (with the 2.0 Turbo and an exhaust gas purification via catalytic converter, producing 118 kw/160&nbsp;hp DIN) in the most important foreign market for Saab: the US. Saab also introduced during the model year at all markets the fuel injected non-turbo engine for the Saab 9000 (producing 125&nbsp;hp DIN with catalytic converter, 128&nbsp;hp DIN without), based on the same engine as the turbo version and with four valves per cylinder, electronic ignition and a knock sensor. In the autumn of 1986, Saab organised a record attempt with the Saab 9000, which received much attention in the US and internationally, at the Alabama International Motor Speedway at Talladega, now the Talladega Superspeedway. "Saab Turbo--In The Long Run" took place over 20 days and 20 nights. "The main purpose of the Long Run project is to test the endurance of our cars as part of our ongoing testing program," explained Olle Granlund, head of Saab's engine and transmission department and the person in charge of this project. All three 9000 Turbo 16s passed the 100,000  mark in 21 days, the lead car breaking 21 international and two world speed records in the process. In memory of this event. Saab was to sell special models under the name "Talladega" in the prospective years, not only for the Saab 9000 but also for other model series. Furthermore, the event was repeated 10 years later in 1996 with models of the "NG 900". For MY 1987 a modern ZF automatic with four stages became available (and remained the only available automatic version until the end of production). In 1987 for model year 1988, Saab released a 4-door sedan variant of the 9000 known as the CD. The front of the Sedan was different (more modern) and more streamlined than the hatchback version. This involved smoothing the edges of the headlamps and grille, and sloping the front outwards. Saab adapted the design of the sedan to the current facelift of the Saab 900, which had already received a similar new front for the MY 1987. This re-design marked a departure from the more upright front styling of the 1984 original, which was also similar to the old design of the Saab 900 from 1978 to 1986. The fact that the older medium class model Saab 900 had received the facelift first seems curiously, also that the 9000 hatchback 5-door model still retained the old front design. But it can be explained by the fact that in the 1980s the bulk of sales in the US were still through the classic 900. From 1988, all 9000 variants were equipped with a Saab Information Display (SID) which showed fuel consumption, distance to an empty fuel tank, alternator output voltage, outside temperature, and lowest battery voltage during vehicle start.Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 3, pp 381-2 to 381-3. If the outside temperature fell to , the temperature display is automatically selected to warn of possible "black ice" road conditions. A separate pictogram monitored door and hatch opening and exterior light bulb condition.Saab 9000 Service manual, model year 1997, p, 11. 1988 also marked the introduction of pyrotechnic Seat belt#Technology|seat belt tensioners for the front seats. Saab Direct Ignition was also introduced 1988 with the 9000 CD and its B202 turbo engine. The same engine in the CC got the DI with MY 1989. Since then all new engine releases for the 9000 got the DI from beginning (except later V6 which came from GM). The output of both engines increased slightly through optimisations from 160&nbsp;hp DIN to 163&nbsp;hp DIN (with catalytic converter) and from 125&nbsp;hp DIN to 128&nbsp;hp DIN (with) and from 128&nbsp;hp DIn to 133&nbsp;hp DIN (without). For MY 1990 Saab introduced the new developed larger B234 2.3-litre engine, providing  in the normally aspirated engine. For MY 1991, the "B234" became available also with a turbocharger, producing  and an impressive torque. Unlike the other engines, each of which was also used in the classic Saab 900, the B234 was only used in the Saab 9000 (and later in other model series). For MY 1991 (Europe) and MY 92 (US) Saab also adopted the sloping front of the CD also for the hatchback (CC). With this, the classic flat front of the Saab 90, 99, 900 and the early 9000 was finally over. But this design existed only for this MY on the CC in most markets (the CD notchback kept the old design till MY 1994). Because the next bigger facelift for the Saab 9000 5-door hatchback was followed by release of a partially redesigned body for the 1992 model year in Europe (for MY 1993 in the US), known as the CS. At the release of the CS, the original liftback variant from MY 1985-1991/1992 was retrospectively designated CC to differentiate it from the newer version. The "old" CC was continued to sell out of stock alongside in some markets as an entry-level model and in particular in the US, where the new CS was not available until MY 1993. A new turbocharger management system, Trionic T5.5|Trionic 5 and later Trionic 7, was equipped from the 1993 model year onwards (the Trionic system used resistor spark plugs to detect for engine knock in place of the knock sensors incorporated into the engine block in the previous Automatic Performance Control|APC system). For MY 1993 the model range was revised to provide some uniformity to the model designations on all markets. They became CS/CSE and CD/CDE: - the CS / CD with basis equipment (which in principle already contained more equipment than the German competition in particular offered at the time) - the CSE / CDE came with already most available equipment from factory In principle, both equipment lines could be combined with the engines available in the respective MY. This means that even a "simple" CS could be ordered f.e. with the 200&nbsp;hp turbo engine. End of production: As the 4 doors CD/E and the sporty Aero already expired after MY 1997, only 1400 of the Saab 9000 were produced for the last 1998 model year, and of these only 400 were exported to the United States, the main foreign market for Saab. Saab already concentrated on the successor of the Saab 9000, the Saab 9-5.  Originally known simply as the 9000, the original liftback variant was later given the CC identifier, standing for "Combi Coupe", to differentiate it from the CD ("Corps Diplomatique") sedan and later CS liftback. Saab also uses this different identifier for the Saab 900 versions. While originally equipped with an upright front design, this was replaced by the sloped version in MY 1990 that had earlier debuted on the 9000 CD (sedan) in 1988. The original MY 1985 CC model (for this MY only available in Europe) was powered by an air-cooled, turbocharger|turbocharged, double overhead camshaft, 16-valve inline-four engine, providing 175&nbsp;bhp without and 160&nbsp;bhp with catalysator.Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 0, p 022-1. Earlier on in the development, the PRV engine had also been considered.{{cite web |first = Claes | last = Johansson |url=http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222234734/http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2013 |title=  ...
