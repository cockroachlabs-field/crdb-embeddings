He wrote biographies of Albinoni and other composers, including Antonio Vivaldi. Giazotto served as a music critic (from 1932) and editor (1945–1949) of the "Rivista musicale italiana" and was appointed co-editor of the "Nuova rivista musicale italiana" in 1967. He was a professor of the history of music at the University of Florence (1957–69) and in 1962 was nominated to the Accademia Nazionale di S. Cecilia. In 1949, Giazotto became the director of the chamber music programs for Italian state broadcaster RAI and in 1966 was appointed director of its international programs organized through the European Broadcasting Union. He was also the president of RAI's auditioning committee and editor of its series of biographies on composers. Giazotto was the father of physicist Adalberto Giazotto. == Adagio in G minor == Giazotto is famous for his publication of a work called "Adagio in G minor", which he claimed to have transcribed from a manuscript fragment of an Albinoni sonata that he had found in the Saxon State Library. He stated that he had arranged the work but not composed it. He subsequently revised this story, claiming it as his own original composition. The fragment has never appeared in public; Giazotto stated that it contained only the bass line, and the work was copyrighted by Giazotto.Letter from the Saxon State Library (consultant Marina Lang), 24 September 1990, reproduced in facsimile by Wulf Dieter Lugert and Volker Schütz, „Adagio à la Albinoni“, "Praxis des Musikunterrichts" 53 (February 1998), pp. 13–22, here 15.Carolyn Gianturco.
