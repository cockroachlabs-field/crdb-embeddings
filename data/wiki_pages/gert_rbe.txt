He was best known in English-speaking countries for his work as Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film "Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger", as Peachum in "The Threepenny Opera", as Baron Bomburst in "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", as Hotzenplotz in "The Robber Hotzenplotz|Der Räuber Hotzenplotz",  General Dietrich von Choltitz in "Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?" and Colonel Manfred von Holstein in "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines". == Early life and education == Fröbe was born in Oberplanitz, today part of Zwickau. He was initially a violinist, but he abandoned it for Kabarett and theatre work. He joined the Nazi Party in 1929 at the age of 16 and left in 1937. In September 1944, theatres in Nazi Germany|Germany were closed down and Fröbe was drafted into the German Army (1935–1945)|German Army, where he served until the end of the war. After his party membership became known after World War II, Israel banned Fröbe's films until Mario Blumenau, a Jewish survivor, revealed just eight weeks later that his life and his mother's were probably saved when Fröbe hid them from the Nazis. == Career == Fröbe gained fame in one of the first German films made after the Second World War, called "Berliner Ballade" ("The Ballad of Berlin", 1948). His character's name, "Otto Normalverbraucher" ( Otto Average Consumer), became the German term equivalent to "Average Joe".|title=Deutsches Bühnen-Jahrbuch|access-date=25 August 2011}} He was cast as the villain in the Swiss-West German-Spanish film "Es geschah am hellichten Tag" ("It Happened in Broad Daylight", 1958), with the original screenplay written by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. His role as a serial killer of children drew the attention of the producers of the James Bond movie "Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger" (1964) and he was chosen to play one of the best remembered villains of the series, gold tycoon Auric Goldfinger. He later remarked, "The ridiculous thing is that since I played Goldfinger in the James Bond film there are some people who still insist on seeing me as a cold, ruthless villain – a man without laughs."  File:Gert Fröbe in 1965.png|thumb|Fröbe in 1965 Fröbe made several appearances in all-star casts in the 1960s, including the films "The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day" (1962), "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" (1965), "Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?" (1966),"Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross" (1966), "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968), and "Monte Carlo or Bust" (1969).

He was buried at the Waldfriedhof cemetery in Icking. == Filmography == {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! Year ! Title ! Role !
