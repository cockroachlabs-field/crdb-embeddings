It was first introduced into service with the Russian army in 1998. The Kornet is among the most capable Russian ATGMs. It was further developed into the 9M133 Kornet-EM, which has increased range, and an improved warhead. The Kornet has been widely exported and is produced under license in several countries. It was first used in combat in 2003 and has since been used in many conflicts. ==Development== The Kornet anti-tank missile was unveiled in October 1994 by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. The missile started development in 1988 as a modular, universal system able to engage any target from a mix of platforms using a reliable laser beam guidance system that was simple to use. It is a heavy ATGM, superior to the earlier 9K111 Fagot (NATO: AT-4 Spigot) and 9K113 Konkurs (NATO: AT-5 Spandrel) wire-guided ATGMs, but not to replace them (due to the cost). The missile entered service in the Russian army in 1998. Its export designation is the Kornet-E. The 9P163M-1 Kornet-T tank destroyer entered service in 2012. North Korea has developed a clone of the Kornet known as the "Bulsae-3" (), which was first revealed on 27 February 2016 publicly during a demo test. The 9M133F-1 Kornet variant with a thermobaric warhead was expected to enter serial production in 2019, according to a company report. The NATO reporting name "AT-14 Spriggan" is derived from the spriggan, a legendary creature from Cornwall|Cornish Fairy|faery lore. ==Description== The 9M133 missile together with its 9P163-1 tripod launcher and 1PN79-1 thermal sight (part of the 1P45-1 guidance device), form the 9K135 missile system, which can be carried and operated by a two-person infantry crew. The transfer to the firing position takes less than one minute, and preparation and production of a shot in at least one second. File:AT-14 Kornet-E.jpg|thumb|left|A static Kornet missile and launcher In addition to an infantry portable version, the 9K133 system has been integrated into a variety of other vehicles and weapons systems as either an upgrade package or a new weapon system. The 9K133 has been fitted into a BMP-3 to form the 9P163M-1 tank destroyer and is similar in function to the Khrizantema missile system. The 9P163M-1 carries two 9M133 missiles on launch rails, which are extended from a stowed position during transit. Missiles are re-loaded automatically by the tank destroyer from an internal magazine with 16 rounds (missiles are stored and transported in sealed canisters). NBC protection system|NBC protection is provided for the two crew (gunner and driver) of each 9P163M-1 in addition to full armour protection equivalent to the standard BMP-3 chassis. The guidance system of the 9P163M-1 allows two missiles to be fired at once, each operating on different guidance (laser) channels. The KBP Instrument Design Bureau has also marketed the 9M133 missile as part of the Kvartet system for mounting on vehicles and boats; the system has four missiles on ready-to-launch rails along with associated guidance and sighting system all packaged in a single turret; the guidance system also allows two missiles to be fired at once. The turret has space for an additional five rounds and is operated by a single individual. Another upgrade possibility is the Kliver missile and gun turret, seen as an upgrade option for the BTR series of Armoured personnel carrier|APC, BMP-1 IFV and patrol boats. It has similar capabilities as the Kvartet turret, but also carries a 30&nbsp;mm 30 mm automatic cannon 2A42|2A72 cannon; turret weight is 1,500&nbsp;kg. Finally the 9M133 is also available in the BEREZHOK turret upgrade also made available by KBP. Since 2014, its serial production has been resumed for the domestic market with the designation B05YA01.

The 9M133 Kornet-EM is an improved variant introduced in 2012 that is designed to defeat vehicles with explosive reactive armor (ERA). Its vehicle mounted version is equipped with an automatic target tracker in lieu of a proper fire-and-forget capability. Instead of manually placing the crosshairs on target throughout the missiles flight, the operator designates a target once and the computer tracks the target as the missile travels towards it until impact. New beam coding also allows a vehicle equipped with twin launchers to attack two different targets at once, increasing its rate of fire, decreases the number of veh ...
