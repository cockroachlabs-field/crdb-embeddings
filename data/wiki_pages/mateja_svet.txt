Svet won the World Cup Giant Slalom skiing|giant slalom title in the 1987/1988 season, won silver medal in giant slalom in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, won three medals in 1987 World Championship in Crans-Montana (bronze in Slalom skiing|slalom and Super Giant Slalom skiing|super G, silver in Giant Slalom skiing|giant slalom) and two medals in 1989 World Championship in Vail – gold in Slalom skiing|slalom, later when the bronze Christelle Guignard was disqualified due to doping, also bronze in Giant Slalom skiing|giant slalom.
