The place was named after the nearby karst spring of the Lutter (Schunter)|Lutter (from Middle High German: "lauter", "pure") stream in the Elm hills. A water castle was erected around 1200 and in 1318 the surrounding settlement was documented as a market town. Around 1400 the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Dukes of Brunswick granted the citizens of "Luttere" German town law|town privileges. From the late 14th century onwards, the place was called "Konnigesluttere", referring to late Emperor Lothair III, King of the Romans. Located on the trade route from Brunswick to Magdeburg (the present-day Bundesstraße 1), beer brewing and Elm limestone mining and cutting were its main industries in early modern times, while the monastery developed as a pilgrimage destination. Not until 1924, the monastery complex and the adjacent settlement of "Oberlutter" were incorporated into the town. The monastery church is known for its sculptural art and the tomb of the emperor. ==Politics== File:Königslutter Kirche.jpg|thumb|St Sebastian Church and town hall Seats in the town's assembly ("Rat") as of 2011 local elections: * Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU): 15 * Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 14 * Free Voters: 2 * Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party (FDP): 1 * Alliance 90/The Greens: 1 In 2013 the assembly has voted to enter in merger negotiations with neighbouring Wolfsburg.
