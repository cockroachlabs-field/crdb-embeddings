  In probability theory, the "law" (or "formula") "of total probability" is a fundamental rule relating Marginal probability|marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct Event (probability theory)|events, hence the name. ==Statement== The law of total probability isZwillinger, D., Kokoska, S. (2000) "CRC Standard Probability and Statistics Tables and Formulae", CRC Press.  page 31. a theorem that states, in its discrete case, if <math>\left\ "overall probability" is sometimes used in less formal writings. The law of total probability can also be stated for conditional probabilities:  :<math>P( {A|C} ) = \frac = \frac = \frac = \sum\limits_n P ( {A\mid {B_n},C} )P(  One author uses the terminology of the "Rule of Average Conditional Probabilities", while another refers to it as the "continuous law of alternatives" in the continuous case. This result is given by Grimmett and Welsh"Probability: An Introduction", by Geoffrey Grimmett and Dominic Welsh, Oxford Science Publications, 1986, Theorem 1B.  as the "partition theorem", a name that they also give to the related law of total expectation. ==See also== * Law of total expectation * Law of total variance * Law of total covariance * Law of total cumulance * Marginal distribution == Notes ==  == References == * "Introduction to Probability and Statistics" by Robert J.
