Warragul lies between the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and the Mount Baw Baw Plateau of the Great Dividing Range to the north. As of the , the town had a population of 19,856 people. Warragul forms part of a larger urban area that includes nearby Drouin, Victoria|Drouin that had an estimated total population of 42,827 as of the . Warragul is the main population and service centre of the West Gippsland region and the Shire of Baw Baw. The surrounding area is noted for dairy farming and other niche agriculture and has long been producing gourmet foods. ==Naming== Warragul (or warrigal, worrigle, warragal) is a New South Wales Indigenous Australians|Indigenous word from the Darug language meaning "wild dog" or "dingo". The town name is accepted to mean "wild dog" and various businesses in the town use the words 'Wild Dog' in their name. However, the word was recorded as being used by settlers of Gippsland in the 1840s and 1850s to mean "wild Aboriginal" or a Gunai people|Gunai/Kurnai person. The traditional land of the Gunai/Kurnai people includes the town of Warragul, then intersects with Kulin territory to the west of the town. In a local history book, Graeme Butler wrote that the name of Warragul station was derived from an Indigenous word just meaning "wild". British botanist Daniel Bunce recorded warrigal as belonging to a Kulin people|Kulin language and meaning "wild", "ferocious" and "enemy", but P D Gardner suggests Bunce was correct in translation, but incorrect in origin, since the word comes from Darug. The word is also used for the naming of Warrigal Creek in South Gippsland to refer to the inhabitants of the area. ==History== The town of Warragul began as a construction camp on McLeod's Track, now Brandy Creek Road, at the point where the surveyed railway line linked to the coach road. John Lardner surveyed the townships along the line in 1877 and noted that the early arrivals in the area were squatters, who had erected their shops and dwellings on Crown land. The squatters' blocks were not offered for the first sale of town land on 2 March 1878, but were available to purchase on the second sale later that month. In November 1873, The Victorian Parliament passed an Act approving the construction of a railway linking Oakleigh to Sale. The construction of Gippsland railway line began simultaneously from both directions. The Warragul railway station opened on 1 March 1878 and the first train ran through in the same month. In May 1890 Warragul railway station became a junction station when a branch line was opened to Rokeby, Victoria|Rokeby (later extended to Neerim South and Noojee). The first Warragul post office opened on 16 March 1877 at the general store operated by James Biram, who became the first postmaster. A contract to build an official post office was made on 4 April 1887 and a foundation stone was laid on 4 June 1887. The building was completed and occupied the following year. Warragul's modern post office was opened on 3 April 1967, after the old post office closed on 18 September 1965 and was demolished in 1966. Existing roads were renamed Princes Highway after the visit to Australia in 1920 of the then Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII).  The highway was officially opened on 10 August 1920 at a ceremony in Warragul. Warragul's Petersville Milk Products Factory in Queen Street supplied the famous Peters Ice Cream brand's factory in Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave with all the dairy raw material (fresh cream and concentrated skim milk) for 35 years. The plant also manufactured skim milk powder under the famous Dutch Jug brand and butter under the Iceberg brand. It exported butter, butter oil and milk powders to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Warragul was voted Premier Town in Victoria, 1970–1973. The Warragul Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990. ==Geography== Warragul is located on hills that extend north from the Strzelecki Ranges near Ellinbank, Victoria|Ellinbank, joining to the Baw Baw National Park|Baw Baws in the Neerim District. This range is historically referred to as the Warragul Hills. The range effectively separates the flatlands of the Koo-Wee-Rup swamp (starting near Longwarry) in the west and the Moe Swamp on the eastern side (starting near Darnum). Warragul contains the Linear Park Arts Discovery Trail, a trail covering several adjacent parks in the town. It features painted bollards, mosaics and murals.
