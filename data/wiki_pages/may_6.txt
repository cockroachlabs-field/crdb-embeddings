At the height of events, which have since become known as "May 68", the economy of France came to a halt. The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution; the national government briefly ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to West Germany on the 29th. The protests are sometimes linked to Protests of 1968|similar movements that occurred around the same time worldwide and inspired a generation of protest art in the form of songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans. The unrest began with a series of far-left Student protest|student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism and traditional institutions. Heavy police repression of the protesters led France's Trade unions in France|trade union confederations to call for Solidarity action|sympathy strikes, which spread far more quickly than expected to involve 11 million workers, more than 22% of the total Demographics of France|population of France at the time. The movement was characterized by spontaneous and decentralized wildcat strike action|wildcat disposition; this created a contrast and at times even conflict internally amongst the trade unions and the parties of the left. It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France, and the first nationwide wildcat general strike. The student occupations and general strikes initiated across France were met with forceful confrontation by university administrators and police.  The de Gaulle administration's attempts to quell those strikes by Riot control|police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the Latin Quarter, Paris. By late May the flow of events had changed. The Grenelle agreements|Grenelle accords, concluded on 27 May between the government, trade unions and employers, won significant wage gains for workers. A counter-demonstration organised by the Union of Democrats for the Republic|Gaullist party on 29 May in central Paris gave De Gaulle the confidence to dissolve the National Assembly (France)|National Assembly and call for 1968 French legislative election|parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.  Violence evaporated almost as quickly as it arose.  Workers went back to their jobs, and when the elections were held in June, the Gaullists emerged stronger than before. The events of May 1968 continue to influence French society. The period is considered a cultural, social and moral turning point in the history of the country. Alain Geismar, who was one of the student leaders at the time, later stated that the movement had succeeded "as a social revolution, not as a political one". ==Background==  In February 1968, the French Communist Party and the French Section of the Workers' International formed an electoral alliance. Communists had long supported Socialist candidates in elections, but in the "February Declaration" the two parties agreed to attempt to form a joint government to replace President of France|President Charles de Gaulle and his Gaullist Party.  On 22 March, far-left groups, a small number of prominent poets and musicians, and 150 students occupied an administration building at Paris X University Nanterre|Paris University at Nanterre and held a meeting in the university council room dealing with class discrimination in French society and the political bureaucracy that controlled the university's funding.  The university's administration called the police, who surrounded the university. After the publication of their wishes, the students left the building without any trouble.  After this first record, some leaders of what was named the "Movement of 22 March" were called together by the disciplinary committee of the university. ==Events of May==  File:Paris 75005 Place de la Sorbonne Sainte-Ursule 20041101.jpg|thumb|Public square of Sorbonne (building)|the Sorbonne, in the Latin Quarter of Paris Following months of conflicts between students and authorities at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris (now Paris Nanterre University), the administration shut down the university on 2 May 1968.Rotman, pp. 10–11; Damamme, Gobille, Matonti & Pudal, ed., p. 190. Students at the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris (today Sorbonne University) in Paris met on 3 May to protest against the closure and the threatened expulsion of several students at Nanterre.Damamme, Gobille, Matonti & Pudal, ed., p. 190. On Monday, 6 May, the national student union, the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF) (translation: the National Union of Students of France) —still the largest student union in France today—and the union of university teachers called a march to protest against the police invasion of the Sorbonne. More than 20,000 students, teachers and supporters marched towards the Sorbonne, still sealed off by the police, who charged, wielding their batons, as soon as the marchers approached. While the crowd dispersed, some began to create barricades out of whatever was at hand, while others threw paving stones, forcing the police to retreat for a time. The police then responded with tear gas and charged the crowd again. Hundreds more students were arrested.  High school student unions spoke in support of the riots on 6 May. The next day, they joined the students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers who gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that (1) all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, (2) the police leave the university, and (3) the authorities reopen Nanterre and Sorbonne.  Negotiations broke down, and students returned to their campuses after a false report that the government had agreed to reopen them, only to discover the police still occupying the schools. This led to a near revolutionary fervor among the students. On Friday, 10 May, another huge crowd congregated on the Rive Gauche. When the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité again blocked them from crossing the river, the crowd again threw up barricades, which the police then attacked at 2:15 in the morning after negotiations once again floundered. The confrontation, which produced hundreds of arrests and injuries, lasted until dawn of the following day. The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. Allegations were made that the police had participated in the riots, through "agents provocateurs", by burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails. The government's heavy-handed reaction brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Many of the nation's more mainstream singers and poets joined after the police brutality came to light. American artists also began voicing support of the strikers. The major left union federations, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvrière (CGT-FO), called a one-day general strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. Well over a million people marched through Paris on that day; the police stayed largely out of sight. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou personally announced the release of the prisoners and the reopening of the Sorbonne. However, the surge of strikes did not recede. Instead, the protesters became even more active. When the Sorbonne reopened, students occupied it and declared it an autonomous "people's university". Public opinion at first supported the students, but quickly turned against them after their leaders, invited to appear on national television, "behaved like irresponsible utopianists who wanted to destroy the 'consumer society.'" Nonetheless, in the weeks that followed, approximately 401 popular action committees were set up in Paris and elsewhere to take up grievances against the government and French society, including the Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne|Sorbonne Occupation Committee.  File:French workers with placard during occupation of their factory 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Strikers in Southern France with a sign reading "Factory Occupied by the Workers." Behind them is a list of demands, June 1968. By the middle of May, demonstrations extended to factories, though its workers' demands significantly varied from that of the students. A union-led general strike on 13 May included 200,000 in a march. The strikes spread to all sectors of the French economy, including state-owned jobs, manufacturing and service industries, management, and administration. Across France, students occupied university structures and up to one-third of the country's workforce was on strike.<!-- possibly see Touraine 1968 and Singer 2002 for more; Gastaut 1994 too; might be citogenesis with the content that was previously unsourced in this paragraph --> These strikes were not led by the union movement; on the contrary, the CGT tried to contain this spontaneous outbreak of militancy by channeling it into a struggle for higher wages and other economic demands. Workers put forward a broader, more political and more radical agenda, demanding the ousting of the government and President de Gaulle and attempting, in some cases, to run their factories. When the trade union leadership negotiated a 35% increase in the minimum wage, a 7% wage increase for other workers, and half normal pay for the time on str ...
