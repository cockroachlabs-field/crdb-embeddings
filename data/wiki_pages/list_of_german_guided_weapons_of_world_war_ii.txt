Wagner ==Models==  The V-1, which may be seen as the first cruise missile, was used operationally against London  and Antwerp. The V-2 ballistic missile was used operationally against London, Antwerp, and other targets. The Rheinbote was fired against Antwerp. * V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 flying bomb  * V-2 rocket * Rheinbote * Aggregate (rocket family)#A4b/A9|A4b  Germany developed a number of surface-to-air missile systems, none of which was used operationally: * Enzian missile|Enzian (Gentiana|Gentian) ; Fitzsimons, Bernard, ed.
