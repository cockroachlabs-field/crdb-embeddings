McBain's 87th Precinct works have been adapted, sometimes loosely, into movies and television on several occasions. ==Setting== The series is based on the work of the police detective squad of the 87th Precinct in the central district of Isola, a large fictional city obviously based on New York City.  Isola is the name of the central district of the city (it fulfills the role of the borough of Manhattan within New York City).  Other districts in McBain's fictionalized version of New York broadly correspond to NYC's other four boroughs, Calm's Point standing in for Brooklyn, Majesta representing Queens, Riverhead substituting for the Bronx, and Bethtown for Staten Island. The books feature a large ensemble cast, often but not always centered on about half a dozen police detectives and other supporting characters. Detective Steve Carella was a major character in the series, alongside officers Bert Kling, the ambitious youngster, the hot-tempered Roger Havilland and comic relief from the unfortunately named Meyer Meyer. A mysterious antagonist known as The Deaf Man appeared in several of the books over the years. ==The 87th Precinct Mysteries==  *"Cop Hater" (1956) *"The Mugger (novel)|The Mugger" (1956) *"The Pusher" (1956) *"The Con Man" (1957) *"Killer's Choice" (1957) *"Killer's Payoff" (1958) *"Lady Killer" (1958) *"Killer's Wedge" (1959) *"til Death" (1959) *"King's Ransom (novel)|King's Ransom" (1959) *"Give the Boys a Great Big Hand" (1960) *"The Heckler" (1960) *"See Them Die" (1960) *"Lady, Lady I Did It" (1961) *"The Empty Hours" (1962) - collection of three short novellas *"Like Love" (1962) *"Ten Plus One" (1963) *"Ax" (1964) *"He Who Hesitates" (1964) *"Doll" (1965) *"80 Million Eyes" (1966) *"Fuzz" (1968) *"Shotgun (novel)|Shotgun" (1969) *"Jigsaw" (1970) *"Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here" (1971) *"Sadie When She Died" (1972) *"Let's Hear It for the Deaf Man" (1973) *"Hail to the Chief" (1973) *"Bread" (1974) *"Blood Relatives" (1975) *"So Long as You Both Shall Live" (1976) *"Long Time No See" (1977) *"Calypso" (1979) *"Ghosts" (1980) *"Heat" (1981) *"Ice" (1983) *"Lightning" (1984) *"Eight Black Horses" (1985) *"Poison" (1987) *"Tricks" (1987) *"Lullaby" (1989) *"Vespers" (1990) *"Widows" (1991) *"Kiss" (1992) *"Mischief" (1993) *"And All Through the House" (Novella - 1994) *"Romance" (1995) *"Nocturne" (1997) *"The Big Bad City" (1999) *"The Last Dance" (2000) *"Money, Money, Money" (2001) *"Fat Ollie's Book" (2002) *"The Frumious Bandersnatch" (2003) *"Hark!"
