It is  north of Manchester and  east of Preston, Lancashire|Preston, at the confluence of the River Calder, Lancashire|River Calder and River Brun. The town is located near the countryside to the south and east, with the towns of Padiham and Brierfield, Lancashire|Brierfield to the west and north respectively. It has a reputation as a regional centre of excellence for the manufacturing and aerospace industries. The town began to develop in the early medieval period as a number of farming Hamlet (place)|hamlets surrounded by Manorialism|manor houses and royal forests, and has held a market for more than 700 years. During the Industrial Revolution it became one of Lancashire's most prominent mill towns; at its peak, it was one of the world's largest producers of cotton cloth and a major centre of engineering. Burnley has retained a strong manufacturing sector, and has strong economic links with the cities of Manchester and Leeds, as well as neighbouring towns along the M65 motorway|M65 corridor.  In 2013, in recognition of its success, Burnley received an Enterprising Britain award from the UK Government, for being the "Most Enterprising Area in the UK". For the first time in more than fifty years, a direct train service now operates between the town's Burnley Manchester Road railway station|Manchester Road railway station and Manchester's Manchester Victoria station|Victoria station, via the newly restored Calder Valley line#Todmorden curve|Todmorden Curve, which opened in May 2015.  ==History==  The name Burnley is believed to have been derived from Brun Lea, meaning "meadow by the River Brun". Various other spellings have been used: Bronley (1241), Brunley (1251) and commonly Brumleye (1294) Accessed 2010  Stone Age flint tools and weapons have been found on the Moorland|moors around the town, as have numerous tumuli, stone circles, and some hill forts (see: Castercliff, which dates from around 600 BC). Modern-day Back Lane, Sump Hall Lane and Noggarth Road broadly follow the route of a classic Ridgeway (road)|ridgeway running east–west to the north of the town, suggesting that the area was populated during pre-history and probably controlled by the Brigantes. Limited coin finds indicate a Roman Britain|Roman presence, but no evidence of a settlement has been found in the town. Gorple Road (running east from Worsthorne) appears to follow the route of a Roman roads in Britain|Roman road that may have crossed the present-day centre of town, on the way to the fort at Ribchester.  It has been claimed that the nearby Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks of Ring Stones Camp (), Twist Castle () and Beadle Hill () are of Roman origin, but little supporting archaeological information has been published. Following the Roman period, the area became part of the kingdom of Rheged, and then the kingdom of Northumbria. Local place-names Padiham and Habergham show the influence of the Angles, suggesting that some had settled in the area by the early 7th century; sometime later the land became part of the Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred of Blackburnshire. There is no definitive record of a settlement until after the Norman conquest of England. In 1122, a charter granted the church of Burnley to the monks of Pontefract Abbey. In its early days, Burnley was a small farming community, gaining a gristmill|corn mill in 1290, a market in 1294, and a Fulling|fulling mill in 1296. At this point, it was within the manorialism|manor of Ightenhill, one of five that made up the Honor of Clitheroe, then a far more significant settlement, and consisted of no more than 50 families. Little survives of early Burnley apart from the Market Cross, erected in 1295, which now stands in the grounds of the old grammar school. Over the next three centuries, Burnley grew in size to about 1,200 inhabitants by 1550, still centred around the church, St Peter's Church, Burnley|St Peter's, in what is now known as "Top o' th' Town". Prosperous residents built larger houses, including Gawthorpe Hall in Padiham and Towneley Park|Towneley Hall.   In 1532, St Peter's Church was largely rebuilt. Burnley's grammar school was founded in 1559, and moved into its own schoolhouse next to the church in 1602. Burnley began to develop in this period into a small market town, with a population of not more than 2,000 by 1790. It is known that weaving was established in the town by the middle of the 18th century, and in 1817 a new Market House was built. The town continued to be centred on St Peter's Church, until the market was moved to the bottom of what is today Manchester Road, at the end of the 19th century.   In the second half of the 18th century, the manufacture of Cotton mill|cotton began to replace wool. Burnley's earliest known factories&nbsp;– dating from the mid-century&nbsp;– stood on the banks of the River Calder, Lancashire|River Calder, close to where it is joined by the River Brun, and relied on water power to drive the Spinning jenny|spinning machines. The first Toll roads in Great Britain|turnpike road through the area now known as Burnley was begun in 1754, linking the town to Blackburn and Colne eventually leading to the area of Brun Lea developing into a town, and by the mid 19th century, there were daily stagecoach journeys to Blackburn, Skipton and Manchester, the latter taking just over two hours. The 18th century also saw the rapid development of coal mining on the Burnley Coalfield: the Drift mining|drift mines and shallow Bell pit|bell-pits of earlier centuries were replaced by deeper shafts, meeting industrial as well as domestic demand in Nelson, Colne & Padiham, and by 1800 there were over a dozen pits in the modern-day centre of the town alone. File:LeedsLiverpoolCanalBurnley2.JPG|thumb|left|Burnley wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal  The arrival of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1796 made possible transportation of goods in bulk, bringing a huge boost to the area's economy and the town of Burnley was born. Dozens of new mills were constructed, along with many foundries and ironworks that supplied the cotton mills and coal mines with machinery and cast iron|cast and wrought iron for construction.  The town became renowned for its mill-engines, and the Lancashire Loom|Burnley Loom was recognised as one of the best in the world. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Burnley Barracks in 1820. Disaster struck the town in 1824, when first its only local bank (known as Holgate's) collapsed, Accessed 2010 forcing the closure of some of the largest mills.  This was followed by a summer drought, which caused serious problems for many of the others, leading to high levels of unemployment and possibly contributing to the national Panic of 1825|financial crisis of 1825. By 1830, there were 32 Stationary steam engine|steam engines in cotton mills throughout the rapidly expanding town, an example of which, originally installed at Harle Syke Mill, is on display in the Science Museum (London)|Science Museum in London.  Accessed 2010 Around 1840, a traveller described the town as ugly, stating that: "parts of it were so situated that good architectural effects might have been obtained had the disposition and the resources co-existed". The Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of Ireland led to an influx of Irish families during the 1840s, who formed a community in one of the poorest districts.  At one time, the Park District (modern-day town centre, around Parker St.) was known as Irish Park. In 1848, the East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway Company's extension from Accrington linked the town to the nation's nascent railway network for the first time. This was another significant boost to the local economy and, by 1851, the town's population had reached almost 21,000. The Burnley Building Society#cite note-nat-arch-1|Burnley Building Society, incorporated in Burnley in 1850, was, by 1911, not only 'by far the largest in the County of Lancashire... but the sixth in magnitude in the kingdom'. The Lancashire Cotton Famine|Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, caused by the American Civil War, was again disastrous for the town. However, the resumption of trade led to a quick recovery and, by 1866, the town was the largest producer of cotton cloth in the world. . Retrieved 6 September 2007. By the 1880s, the town was manufacturing more looms than anywhere in the country. Accessed 2010 In 1871, the population was 44,320, and had grown to 87,016 by 1891. Burnley Town Hall, designed by Holton and Fox of Dewsbury, was built between 1885 and 1888. The Burnley Electric Lighting Order was granted in 1890, giving Burnley Corporation (which already controlled the supply of water and the making and sale of gas) a monopoly in the generation and sale of electricity in the town. The building of the coal-powered Burnley power station|Electricity Works, in Grimshaw Street, began in 1891, close to the canal (the site of the modern-day Tesco supermarket) and the first supply was achieved on 22 August 1893, initially generating electricity for street lighting.  Accessed 2010 The start of the 20th century saw Burnley's textile industry at the height of its prosperity. By 1901 there were 700,000 spindles and 62,000 looms at work in the textile industry. Other industries at that time included: brass and iron foundries, rope works, calico printing works, tanneries, paper mills, collieries and corn mills and granaries. By 1910, there were approximately 99,000 power looms in the town, and it reached its peak population of over 100,000 in 1911.  By 1920, the Burnley and District Weavers', Winders' and Beamers' Association had more than 20,000 members.{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Arthur|last2=Ryan|first2=Victoria|last3=Smethurst|first3=John B.|title=Historical Directory of Trade Unions|volume=4|date=1994|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham|isbn=9780859679008|pages=[https://archive.org ...
