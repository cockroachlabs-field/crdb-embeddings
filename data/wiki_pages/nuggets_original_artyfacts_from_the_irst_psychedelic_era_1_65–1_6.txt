   |rev2 = "MSN Music" (Robert Christgau#Consumer Guide|Consumer Guide) |rev2score = A− | rev3 = "Encyclopedia of Popular Music" | rev3Score =  }} ""Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era"" is a compilation album of American psychedelic rock|psychedelic and garage rock single (music)|singles that were released during the mid-to-late 1960s. It was created by Lenny Kaye, who was a writer and clerk at the Village Oldies record shop in New York. He would later become the lead guitarist for the Patti Smith Group. Kaye produced "Nuggets" under the supervision of Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman.  Kaye conceived the project as a series of roughly eight LP installments focusing on different US regions, but Elektra convinced him that one double album would be more commercially viable. It was released on vinyl record|LP by Elektra in 1972 with liner notes by Kaye that contained one of the first uses of the term "punk rock"."Cue: The Weekly Magazine of New York Life." Cue publishing. 1972.  p. 10. It was reissued with a new gatefold|cover design by Sire Records in 1976.  In the 1980s, Rhino Records issued "Nuggets" in a Nuggets (series)|series of fifteen installments, and in 1998 as a 4-cd box set. ==Legacy== Jon Savage, in his history of the UK punk rock scene, "England's Dreaming", cites "Nuggets" as a major influence on punk bands and includes it in his essential punk discography, alongside The Stooges|Iggy and the Stooges' "Raw Power" and The Velvet Underground's "White Light/White Heat". Many other compilation albums took their cue from "Nuggets", including the "Pebbles (series)|Pebbles", "Rubble" - 20 volumes of mainly UK 1960s-era psychedelia released in the 1980s - and "Back from the Grave (series)|Back From the Grave" series.  "Nuggets" spawned an entire cottage industry of small record labels dedicated to unearthing and releasing obscure but worthy garage and psychedelic rock music from the 1960s. In 1998 Rhino Entertainment|Rhino brought the original LP to compact disc|CD, reproducing the original song sequence and liner notes. However, rather than releasing a single-disc release of the original LP, Rhino put the original disc in a box set with three other discs, an extra 91 songs in total that were not on the original LP. Contrary to popular belief, many of the songs were American Top 40 hits: more than a third of the original "Nuggets" would fall into that category, while Rhino's expanded set featured such smash hits as "Incense and Peppermints (song)|Incense and Peppermints" by Strawberry Alarm Clock (#1), "Louie, Louie" by the Kingsmen (#2), "Wooly Bully" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs (#2), "Little Bit o' Soul" by the Music Explosion (#2), and "Time Won't Let Me" by The Outsiders (American band)|the Outsiders (#5). "Louie, Louie", "Laugh, Laugh", "Farmer John", "Psycho", "The Witch", and The Gestures' "Run, Run, Run" fall outside the set's stated time frame of 1965–1968; "Louie, Louie" having been released in 1963 and the rest in 1964. In Europe in 2006 Rhino released a remastered version of the album featuring the original 1972 tracklist on a single compact disc in a miniaturized replica of the original gatefold sleeve. However, unlike the original album the tracks were presented using their mono mixes. In 2012 the album was again remastered, this time directly from the same tapes as the original 1972 release, featuring mono and stereo mixes. Available in double LP and digital formats, this version included updated release notes from Kaye and Jac Holzman. It was voted number 479 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's "All Time Top 1000 Albums" (2000). In 2003, the album was ranked number 196 on "Rolling Stone"s list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. It was later ranked down at 405 on the 2020 edition. ==Track listing==  #The Electric Prunes: "I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)" (Annette Tucker, Nancie Mantz) – 3:02 (1966, #11) (Reprise Records|Reprise) #The Standells: "Dirty Water" (Ed Cobb) – 2:50 (1966, #11) (Tower Records (record label)|Tower) #The Strangeloves: "Night Time (song)|Night Time" (Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein (musician)|Jerry Goldstein, Richard Gottehrer) – 2:35 (1966, #30) (Bang Records|Bang) #The Knickerbockers: "Lies (The Knickerbockers song)|Lies" (Beau Charles, Buddy Randell) – 2:46 (1965, #20) (Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge) #The Vagrants: "Respect (song)|Respect" (Otis Redding) – 2:17 (1967, Uncharted) (Atco Records|ATCO) #Mouse and the Traps|Mouse: "A Public Execution" (Knox Henderson, Ronnie Weiss) – 3:02 (1966, #121) (Fraternity Records|Fraternity) #Blues Project|The Blues Project: "No Time Like the Right Time" (Al Kooper) – 2:49 (1967, #96) (Verve Forecast Records|Verve Folkways)  #Shadows of Knight|The Shadows of Knight: "Oh Yeah" (Bo Diddley|Elias McDaniel) – 2:51 (1966, #39) (Dunwich Records|Dunwich) #The Seeds: "Pushin' Too Hard" (Sky Saxon|Richard Marsh) – 2:39 (1966, #36) (GNP Crescendo Records|GNP Crescendo) #The Barbarians (band)|The Barbarians: "Moulty (song)|Moulty" (Barbara Baer, Doug Morris|Douglas Morris, Eliot Greenberg, Robert Schwartz) – 2:37 (1966, #90) (Laurie Records|Laurie) #The Remains (band)|The Remains: "Don't Look Back (The Remains song)|Don't Look Back" (Billy Vera|William McCord) – 2:45 (1966, Uncharted) (Epic Records|Epic) #The Magicians (band)|The Magicians: "An Invitation to Cry" (Alan Gordon (songwriter)|Alan Gordon, James Woods) – 2:59 (1965, Uncharted) (Columbia Records|Columbia) #The Castaways: "Liar, Liar (The Castaways song)|Liar, Liar" (Dennis Craswell, Jim Donna) – 1:56 (1965, #12) (Soma Records (U.S. label)|Soma) #The 13th Floor Elevators: "You're Gonna Miss Me" (Roky Erickson) – 2:31 (1966, #55) (International Artists)  #Count Five: "Psychotic Reaction" (Craig Atkinson, John Byrne (musician)|John Byrne, John Michalski, Kenn Ellner, Roy Chaney) – 3:09 (1966, #5) (Double Shot) #The Leaves: "Hey Joe" (Billy Roberts) – 2:53 (1966, #31) (Mira Records|Mira) #Michael and the Messengers: "(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet|Romeo & Juliet" (Bob Hamilton, Fred Gorman) – 2:02 (1967, #129) (USA Records|USA) #The Cryan' Shames: "Sugar and Spice (The Searchers song)|Sugar and Spice" (Fred Nightingale) – 2:33 (1966, #49) (Destination) #The Amboy Dukes: "Baby Please Don't Go" (Big Joe Williams) – 5:41 (1968, #106) (Mainstream Records|Mainstream) #Blues Magoos: "Tobacco Road (song)|Tobacco Road" (John D.
