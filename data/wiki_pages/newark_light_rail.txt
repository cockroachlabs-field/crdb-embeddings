The service consists of two segments, the original "Newark City Subway" ("NCS"), and the extension to Broad Street Station (Newark)|Broad Street station. The City Subway opened on May 16, 1935, while the combined Newark Light Rail service was officially inaugurated on July 17, 2006. ==Newark City Subway== File:NewarkSubwayPCC.agr.jpg|thumb|left|PCC streetcar at Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station in 2001, signed as "7 City Subway". The Newark City Subway is the longer and older of the two segments.See Riley, John Harrington, "The Newark City Subway Lines," (1987). This scarce book, which covers the history of the subway lines and the predecessor horse and trolley lines, is occasionally available on Amazon. The line is a "subway–surface" line which runs underground from Penn Station to Warren Street, and above-ground north of Warren Street. Before becoming a part of the Newark Light Rail service, it was also known as the "#7-City Subway line," an NJT Bus Operations route number carried over from its days when it was part of Public Service Corporation|Public Service's Transport of New Jersey subsidiary. The number still applies internally. (During subway system closures, replacement buses would also bear the route number "7 City Subway.") The segment is  long and runs between Grove Street in Bloomfield, New Jersey|Bloomfield and Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station, a major transportation hub with connections to the PATH (rail system)|PATH rapid transit system to Manhattan, multiple bus routes, and both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit Rail Operations trains.  File:NJPSCT 7 (PCC) at Orange Street station, September 3, 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Newark City Subway leaving Park Street station on September 3, 1965 The line opened in 1935 along the old Morris Canal right-of-way, from Broad Street (now known as Military Park (NLR station)|Military Park) to Heller Parkway (now replaced by the nearby Branch Brook Park station). Works Progress Administration artists decorated the underground stations with Art Deco scenes from life on the defunct Morris Canal. The southernmost part, south of Warren Street, was capped with a new road, known as Raymond Boulevard. Only one grade crossing was present on the original subway; the line crosses Orange Street at grade so it can pass over the below-grade Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (now NJT Morristown Line) immediately to the north. The original Newark City Subway line had its own Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way and did not share city streets with local traffic, except at the Orange Street grade crossing. Operation of the complete subway to the newly built Newark Penn Station|Penn Station was delayed until 1937. The terminal below Penn Station has five tracks, two incoming and three outgoing, connected by two loop tracks. This part of the subway included a grade-separated junction with a connection to the lower level of the Newark Public Service Terminal that was used for only a few months (June to September).

In 1953 the line was cut back about one block to accommodate construction of a turning loop, and a new station, still called Franklin Avenue, was opened adjacent to Anthony Street. The station was enlarged in 2002 and renamed Branch Brook Park. The subway was operated by Transport of New Jersey (formerly Public Service Coordinated Transport) as its No. 7 line. Other streetcar routes used parts of the subway, reaching street trackage at the locations shown below, ending as each route was closed and replaced by bus service: *Newark Public Service Terminal|Public Service Terminal connection (and Cedar Street Subway), 1937 only: #13 Broad, #17 Paterson, #27 Mount Prospect, #43 Jersey City *Warren Street ramp, 1935–1951: #21 Orange—West Orange via Market Street *Central Avenue ramp, 1935–1947: #23 Central *Orange Street crossing, 1935–1952: #21 Orange—West Orange via Orange Street *Bloomfield Avenue ramp, 1935–1952: #29 Bloomfield Until June 5, 1952, the Roseville, Newark, New Jersey|Roseville Car House, on the south side of Main Street (on the No. 21 line) near the eastern city line of East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange, was used for the No. 7 line. From that time until 2002, Newark Penn Station was used for storage and maintenance. A new shops and yard complex opened at the end of the extension to Grove Street. Starting in January 1954, 30 PCC streetcars bought from Twin City Rapid Transit provided all service on the route. They were single-ended, requiring construction of a new turning loop at the Franklin Avenue terminal. The cars had been built 1946–1949 by the St. Louis Car Company and were sold by TCRT when that system went through a conversion to buses. Four cars were scrapped over the years, and two were sold to Shaker Heights Rapid Transit in 1978. New Jersey Transit took over operations in 1980. In 2001, new light rail cars built by Kinki Sharyo in Japan in 1999 replaced the PCCs. The last day of PCC service was August 24, 2001."Farewell to Newark PCCs" (October 2001). "Tramways & Urban Transit", p. 386. Ian Allan Publishing. File:NJ Transit streetcar No7.jpg|right|thumb|The former PCC railcar No. 7 from the subway located on the property of the New York Museum of Transportation Some of the PCCs are stored in the Newark City Subway shop. Eleven were sold in 2004 to the San Francisco Municipal Railway for use on its F Market & Wharves|F Market heritage streetcar line. One PCC, #15, was delivered to the Connecticut Trolley Museum in 2013 for restoration and display. One of the Shaker Heights cars has been restored by the Minnesota Transportation Museum, which operates it on a short stretch of track in western Minneapolis. In 2005, eight PCCs were given to the City of Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne to be rehabilitated and operated along a proposed  loop to serve the Peninsula at Bayonne Harbor, formerly Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne (MOTBY). The proposed line would be connected to the 34th Street (HBLR station)|34th Street station of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail. , page 17, accessed July 25, 2006 On September 4, 2004, Broad Street Station was renamed Military Park Station, to avoid confusion with the terminal of the new route to the Broad Street Station (Newark)|Newark Broad Street Station at University Avenue, operated by New Jersey Transit.

New stations were opened at Silver Lake station|Silver Lake and Grove Street station (Newark Light Rail)|Grove Street, and the Heller Parkway and Franklin Avenue stations were combined into a new Branch Brook Park station. The loop at Franklin Avenue was removed, since the new vehicles are bidirectional, unlike the old PCCs. A new loop, however, is in place at the Grove Street facility. All the street crossings on the extension are grade crossing|at-grade.Staff. , "The Philadelphia Inquirer", February 13, 2006. Accessed July 18, 2011. "The last major expansion of the 4.3 mile subway in 2002 brought the service into the neighboring cities of Belleville and Bloomfield." = The original agreement gave sole operating privileges to Norfolk Southern between 11&nbsp;pm and 5&nbsp;am daily, but a new agreement allows passenger service to operate at all hours, with late-night service commencing on January 8, 2005. In exchange, Norfolk Southern can now operate during all off-peak hours, when passenger trains are infrequent. ==Broad Street Extension== File:NLRSendintheClowns.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Lyrics to "Send in the Clowns", part of the tribute to Sarah Vaughan built into every station along this line The Broad Street Extension is the second segment of the Newark Light Rail. It was planned as the first phase of the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link. The line is  long and connects Newark Penn Station to Newark Broad Street Station|Broad Street Station. It branches off the older City Subway using the existing junction that had led to the Newark Public Service Terminal|Public Service terminal. A new tunnel leads from the junction to a portal about two blocks north. The remaining section runs above ground. For a few blocks, the two tracks run on different streets a block or two apart. Both tracks serve the New Jersey Performing Arts Center at Center Street. The outbound track makes stops at Atlantic Street station|Atlantic Street and at the Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium. The inbound track makes a stop at Washington Park station (Newark Light Rail)|Washington Park. The extension opened on July 17, 2006. Press Release 323. Construction began in 2002 with an estimated cost of $207.7 million, or about $40,000 per foot of track; Project 005. it was completed within budget.{{cite web |url=http://www.njtransit.com/nn_press_release.jsp?PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2246 |title ...
