After the failure of the Fourth Crusade, Pope Innocent III|Innocent III again called for a crusade, and began organizing Crusading armies led by Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI of Austria, soon to be joined by John of Brienne. An initial campaign in late 1217 in Syria was inconclusive, and Andrew departed. A German army led by cleric Oliver of Paderborn, and a mixed army of Dutch people|Dutch, Flemish people|Flemish and Frisian participation in the Crusades|Frisian soldiers led by William I of Holland, then joined the Crusade in Acre, Israel#Second Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1191–1291)|Acre, with a goal of first conquering Egypt, viewed as the key to Jerusalem. There, cardinal Pelagius Galvani arrived as papal legate and "de facto" leader of the Crusade, supported by John of Brienne and the masters of the Templar|Templars, Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers and Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II, who had taken the cross in 1215, did not participate as promised. Following the successful Siege of Damietta (1218–19)|siege of Damietta in 1218–1219, the Crusaders occupied the port for two years. Al-Kamil, now sultan of Egypt, offered attractive peace terms, including the restoration of Jerusalem to Christian rule. The sultan was rebuked by Pelagius several times, and the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. En route, they attacked a stronghold of al-Kamil at the Battle of Mansurah (1221)|battle of Mansurah, but they were defeated, forced to surrender. The terms of surrender included the retreat from Damietta—leaving Egypt altogether—and an eight-year truce. The Fifth Crusade ended in September 1221, a Crusader defeat that failed to achieve its goals. ==Background== By 1212, Pope Innocent III|Innocent III had been pope for 14 years and had faced the disappointment of the Fourth Crusade and its inability to recover Jerusalem, the on-going Albigensian Crusade, begun in 1209, and the popular fervor of the Children's Crusade of 1212. The Latin Empire|Latin Empire of Constantinople was established, with the emperor Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I essentially elected by the Venetians. (The imperial crown was at first offered to doge Enrico Dandolo, who refused it.) The first Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, the Venetian Thomas Morosini, was contested by the pope as uncanonical. The ongoing situation in Europe was chaotic. Philip of Swabia was locked in a dispute of the throne in Germany with Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick. Innocent III's attempts to reconcile their differences was rendered moot with Philip's assassination on 21 June 1208. Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor and fought against the pope, resulting in his excommunication. France was heavily invested in the Albigensian Crusade and was quarreling with John, King of England|John Lackland, resulting in the Anglo-French War (1213–1214)|Anglo-French war of 1213–1214. Sicily was ruled by the child-king Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry II and Spain was occupied in their crusade against the Almohad Caliphate|Almohads. There was little appetite in Europe for a new Crusade. In Jerusalem, John of Brienne became the effective ruler of the kingdom through his marriage to Maria of Montferrat. In 1212, Isabella II of Jerusalem was proclaimed queen of Jerusalem shortly after her birth, and her father John became regent. Antioch was consumed with the War of the Antiochene Succession, begun with the death of Bohemond III of Antioch|Bohemond III, not to be resolved until 1219.Goldsmith, Linda (2006). In "The Crusades – An Encyclopedia". pp. 690–691. Before the arrival of John of Brienne in Acre in 1210, the local Christians had refused to renew their truce the Ayyubids. The next year, John negotiated with the aging sultan al-Adil a new truce between the kingdom and the sultanate to last through 1217. At the same time, in light of the strength of the Muslims and their renewed fortifications, John also asked the pope for help. There was no real force among the Syrian Franks, with many of the deployed knights returning home. If a new Crusade were to begin, it must come from Europe. Innocent III had hoped to mount such a Crusade to the Holy Land, never forgetting the goal of restoring Jerusalem to Christian control. The pathos of the Children's Crusade only nerved him to fresh efforts.  But for Innocent, this tragedy had its moral: “the very children put us to shame, while we sleep they go forth gladly to conquer the Holy Land.” ==Preparations for the Crusade== In April 1213, Innocent III issued his papal bull "Quia maior", calling all of Christendom to join a new Crusade. This was followed by a conciliar decree, the "Ad Liberandam," in 1215. The attendant papal instructions engaged a new enterprise to recover Jerusalem while establishing Crusading norms that were to last nearly a century. The message of the Crusade was preached in France by legate Robert of Courçon, a former classmate of the pope's. He was met with bitter complaints by the clergy, accusing the legate of encroaching on their domains. Philip II of France supported his clergy, and Innocent III realized the Robert's zeal was a threat to the success of the Crusade. On 11 November 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council was convened."wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Fourth Lateran Council (1215)|Fourth Lateran Council (1215)". In "Catholic Encyclopedia" (1913). New York: Robert Appleton Company. The prelates of France presented their grievances, many well-founded, and the pope pleaded for them to forgive the legate's indiscretions. In the end, very few Frenchmen took part in the expedition of 1217, unwilling to go in the company of Germans and Hungarians, with France represented by Aubrey (archbishop of Reims)|Aubrey of Reims and the bishops of Roman Catholic Diocese of Limoges#1000 to 1300|Limoges and Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayeux#1000 to 1300|Bayeux, Jean de Veyrac and Robert des Ablèges. At the council, Innocent III called for the recovery of the Holy Land. Innocent wanted it to be led by the papacy, as the First Crusade should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the Fourth Crusade, which had been taken over by the Venetians. He planned to meet with the Crusaders at Brindisi and Messina for departure on 1 June 1217, and prohibited trade with the Muslims in order to ensure that the Crusaders would have ships and weapons, renewing an 1179 edict. Every Crusader would receive an indulgence as well as those who simply helped pay the expenses of a Crusader, but did not go on the Crusade themselves. In order to protect Raoul of Merencourt, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, on his return trip to the kingdom, Innocent III tasked John of Brienne to provide escort. As John was in conflict with Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo I of Armenia and Hugh I of Cyprus, the pope ordered them to reconcile their differences before the Crusaders reached the Holy Land. Innocent III died on 16 July 1216 and Pope Honorius III|Honorius III was consecrated as pope the next week. The Crusade dominated the early part of his papacy.Smith, Thomas W. (2013). "“. Ph.D thesis, University of London. The next year, he crowned Peter II of Courtenay as Latin Emperor, who captured on his eastward journey in Despotate of Epirus|Epirus and died in confinement. Robert of Courçon was sent as spiritual advisor to the French fleet, but subordinate to newly-chosen papal delegate Pelagius of Albano. Bishop Walter II (bishop of Autun)|Walter II of Autun, a veteran of the Fourth Crusade, would also return to the Holy Land with the Fifth Crusade. French canon Jacques de Vitry had come under the influence of the saintly Marie of Oignies and preached the Albigensian Crusade after 1210. He arrived at his new position as Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|Bishop of Acre in 1216 and shortly thereafter Honorius III tasked him with preaching the Crusade in the Latin settlements of Syria, made difficult with the rampant corruption at the port cities.Louis Bréhier|Bréhier, Louis (1910). "wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Jacques de Vitry|Jacques de Vitry". In Herbermann, Charles (ed.). "Catholic Encyclopedia". "8". New York: Robert Appleton Company. Oliver of Paderborn preached the Crusade in Germany and had great success in recruitment.Hoogeweg, Hermann (1887). "". In Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|"Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie" (ADB). "24." Duncker & Humblot, Berlin. In July 1216, Honorius III called on Andrew II of Hungary to fulfill his father's vow to lead a Crusade. Like many other rulers, the pope's former pupil, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Germany, had taken an oath to embark for the Holy Land in 1215 and appealed to German nobility to join. But Frederick II hung back, with his crown still in contention with Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV, and Honorius repeatedly put off the date for the beginning of the expedition. In Europe, the troubadours were equally adept in awakening the interest in the Crusade. These included Elias Cairel, a veteran of the Fourth Crusade, Pons de Capduelh, later joining the Crusade in 1220, and Aimeric de Peguilhan|Aimery de Pégulhan, who implored by verse a young William VI, Marquis of Montferrat|William VI of Montferrat to follow in his father's footsteps and take the cross. The strength of the armies was estimated at more than 32,000, including more than 10,000 knights. It was described by a contemporaneous Arab historian as: "This year, an infinite number of warriors left from Rome the great and other countries of the West." The Crusader force was also prepared to use the latest siege technology, including Trebuchet#Counterweight trebuchet|counterweight trebuchets. ==In Iberia and the Levant== The departure of the Crusaders began finally in early July 1217. Many of the Crusaders decided to go to the Holy Land by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there, led by William I of Holland, they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of Santiago de Compostela. At their arrival in Portugal, the Patriarchate of Lisbon|Bishop of Lisbon attempted to persuade the Crusaders to help them capture the Almohad controlled city of Alcácer do Sal. The Frisians, however, refused on account of Innocent III's disqualification of the venture at the Fourth Lateran Council. The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of Alcácer do Sal in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured the city with the help of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, on October 1217. A group of Frisians who refused to aid the Portuguese with their siege plans against Alacácer do Sal, preferred to raid several coastal towns on their way to the Holy Land. They attacked Faro, Portugal|Faro, Rota, Andalusia|Rota, Cádiz and Ibiza, gaining much booty thereby. They thereafter followed the coast of southern France and wintered in Civitavecchia in Italy in 1217–1218, before continuing on their way to Acre. In the north, Inge II of Norway|Ingi II of Norway took the cross in 1216, only to die the next spring, and the eventual Scandinavian expedition was of little consequence. Innocent III had managed to secure the participation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the Crusade.{{sfn ...
