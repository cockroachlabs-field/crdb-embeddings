The short was greenlit to become a series, which premiered on November 12, 1999, and ended on November 22, 2002, with 4 seasons each consisting of 13 episodes. During its run, the series received critical acclaim and over the years, has developed a strong cult following. It was also nominated for three Golden Reel Award (Motion Picture Sound Editors)|Golden Reel Awards and won one Annie Award. == Premise ==    "Courage the Cowardly Dog" follows Courage (Marty Grabstein), a kind yet easily frightened troublesome <!-- Do not add "purple", "pink", "magenta", etc. here. His color changes with the lighting. --> dog. He was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were sent into outer space by a crazed veterinarian. Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge (Thea White), a friendly Scottish woman who decided to take Courage in as her own, and was inspired by the nature of this first meeting to give him his name. In the present, he lives with the now elderly Muriel and her husband Eustace Bagge (Lionel Wilson (voice actor)|Lionel Wilson in episodes 1–33, Arthur Anderson (actor)|Arthur Anderson in episodes 34–52), a grumpy and greedy American man who regularly mistreats Courage out of jealousy and refers to him as "stupid dog", and frequently scares him with a mask in an isolated farmhouse: the nearest town to the farmhouse is a town called Nowhere. Courage and his owners frequently encounter monsters, aliens, zombies, and other paranormal or supernatural creatures that are attracted to Nowhere. The plot generally uses conventions common to horror films. Although most of the creatures the three face are hostile, some only appear that way, but are simply suffering from distress, anger, and/or acting in desperation, and sometimes because they are depressed, but they can turn out to be friendly to them. The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such dangers falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile with the monster of the week and remedy or repair any damages done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, the full extent of his efforts is usually performed unbeknownst to Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his name, Courage may be considered a genuine hero who often goes to great lengths to protect his owners, and a genuine coward who still expresses much of his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks. Although episodic in nature, there are a handful of recurring characters in the show's cast, including Courage's sarcastic, sentient computer (Simon Prebble); the family physician Dr. Vindaloo (Paul Schoeffler); a fortune-telling Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua named Shirley the Medium (Mary Testa); Eustace's mother "Ma" (Billie Lou Watt); villains Katz and Le Quack (both voiced by Schoeffler), and the antagonistic Di Lung. == Production ==  File:DillyDali2014.jpg|thumb|269x269px| Series creator John R. Dilworth in 2014. Originally, "Courage the Cowardly Dog" was created as a seven-minute animated short, "The Chicken from Outer Space". Dilworth started the animated short with Hanna-Barbera, sponsored by Cartoon Network and introduced Courage. Dilworth graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1985. He became an art director and founded his own animation studio, Stretch Films in 1991, and incorporated in 1994. The character of Courage grew out of an earlier character of Dilworth's called Hamilton, who appeared in "Smart Talk with Raisin", a pilot Dilworth created for MTV. The animated short was shown as one of the episodes of Cartoon Network's "World Premiere Toons" in 1996, a Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Cartoons innovation by then-president Fred Seibert. The short served as a "de facto" pilot for the future series. The original animated short had no dialogue except for one line spoken by Courage, who had a more authoritative voice akin to Jackie Mason than in the series. It was uttered by voice actor Howard Hoffman who also provided all the other vocal sounds and effects for the short. An alien chicken was the villain in this short, who later reappears in the series to seek revenge. His sons also attempt to seek revenge in a later episode. The short was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but lost to the Wallace and Gromit short film "A Close Shave".  When deciding on sound effects, Dilworth tried to avoid pre-made stock sounds. He contributed a substantial amount of new material to sound designer Michael Geisler and only looked for sounds that made him laugh. The composition of the series' music relied on what was being portrayed: suspense, comedy, or Action (fiction)|action. The production crew worked together to come up with new music for the series that had not previously been used. There were a few sections on one particular piece that Dilworth exceptionally liked. The production crew was able to isolate these sections and expand them into a usable theme. Original music featured in "Courage the Cowardly Dog" was composed by Jody Gray and Andy Ezrin. Classical music can be heard at times, which pays homage to classic Warner Bros. animation and the scores of Carl Stalling. In several episodes, Gray arranged various famous classical pieces, such as Richard Wagner|Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries", and wrote up to 15 songs.  "Courage the Cowardly Dog" originally was premiered as a short on February 18, 1996. The show premiered on November 12, 1999, and became the highest-rated premiere in Cartoon Network history at the time. It last aired on November 22, 2002, with 52 episodes produced in four seasons. == Episodes ==  In total, there were 52 episodes in four seasons produced, plus a pilot episode and a special episode. The series ran from November 12, 1999, to November 22, 2002.  == Reception == John G. Nettles of PopMatters reviewed the show and called it, "a fascinating and textured mixture of cartoon and horror-movie conventions, and a joy to watch." Alex Mastas of "Lights Out Films" reviewed the show gave it a grade "A−" and described it: "The backgrounds are rich and imaginative—they composite a lot of the show over real photos and occasionally integrate Computer-generated imagery|CGI into the cartoon. The look is weird and ethereal, just like the show itself." KJ Dell Antonia of Common Sense Media gave three stars out of five with the summary, "Cult fave 'toon plays over-the-top violence for laughs." Antonia warned parents that the series contains graphic animated violence, including "exploding organs, growing extra limbs, turning inside out, you name it". Randy Miller III of DVD Talk said that shows aimed at younger audiences "usually don't go f ...
