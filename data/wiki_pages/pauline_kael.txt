Known for her "witty, biting, highly opinionated and sharply focused" reviews, Kael's opinions often ran contrary to those of her contemporaries. One of the most influential American film critics of her era, she left a lasting impression on the art form. Roger Ebert argued in an obituary that Kael "had a more positive influence on the climate for film in America than any other single person over the last three decades". Kael, he said, "had no theory, no rules, no guidelines, no objective standards. You couldn't apply her 'approach' to a film. With her it was all personal." In a blurb for "The Age of Movies", a collection of her writings for the Library of America, Ebert wrote that "Like George Bernard Shaw, she wrote reviews that will be read for their style, humor and energy long after some of their subjects have been forgotten."

She reinvented the form, and pioneered an entire aesthetic of writing." ==Early life and education == Kael was born to Isaac Paul Kael and Judith Kael (née Friedman), Jewish emigrants from Poland, on a chicken farm among other Jewish chicken farmers, in Petaluma, California. Her siblings are Louis (<!-- born February 27, -->1906), Philip (<!-- born May 12, -->1909), Annie, (<!-- born on September 23, -->1912), and Rose (<!-- Rosa? born November 30, -->1913).<!-- COUSINS? Louis (1918), and Joseph (1914) --> Her parents lost their farm when Kael was eight, and the family moved to San Francisco. Kael attended high school in San Francisco. In 1936 she matriculated at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied philosophy, literature, and art, but dropped out in 1940. Kael had intended to go on to law school, but fell in with a group of artists and moved to New York City with the poet Robert Horan. Three years later, Kael returned to Berkeley and "led a bohemianism|bohemian life," writing plays, and working in experimental film. In 1948, Kael and the filmmaker James Broughton had a daughter, Gina James, whom Kael would raise alone.Seligman (2004).  p. 11. Gina had a congenital heart defect through much of her childhood, which Kael could not afford the surgery to correct.Brantley (1996). p. 10. To support her daughter and herself, Kael worked a series of menial jobs such as cook and seamstress, along with stints as an advertising copywriter. == Early career == In 1952, Peter D. Martin, the editor of City Lights Bookstore#Founding and early years|"City Lights" magazine overheard Kael arguing about films in a coffeeshop with a friend and asked her to review Charlie Chaplin's "Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight." Kael dubbed the film "Slimelight" and began publishing film criticism regularly in magazines. Kael later explained her writing style: "I worked to loosen my style—to get away from the term-paper pomposity that we learn at college. I wanted the sentences to breathe, to have the sound of a human voice."Brantley (1996). p. 95. Kael disparaged the supposed critic's ideal of Objectivity (journalism)|objectivity, referring to it as "saphead objectivity," and incorporated aspects of autobiography into her criticism. In a review of Vittorio De Sica's 1946 Italian neorealism|neorealist film "Shoeshine (film)|Shoeshine" that has been ranked among her most memorable,Seligman (2004). p. 37. Kael described seeing the film  Kael broadcast many of her early reviews on the alternative public radio station KPFA, in Berkeley, and in 1953, she married Edward Landberg, the owner of the Berkeley Cinema-Guild and Studio. Though their marriage soon ended in divorce, he agreed to pay for Gina's heart surgery, and made Kael the manager of the cinema in 1955, a position she held until 1960. In that role, she programmed the films at the two-screen facility, "unapologetically repeat her favorites until they also became audience favorites." She also wrote "pungent" capsule reviews of the films, which her patrons began collecting.Thomson, David (2002). "Pauline Kael." "The New Biographical Dictionary of Film". New York: Alfred A. Knopf.  . p. 449-50. ==Going mass-market== Kael continued to juggle writing with other work until she received an offer to publish a book of her criticism. Published in 1965 as "I Lost It at the Movies," the collection sold 150,000 paperback copies and was a surprise bestseller. Coinciding with a job at the high-circulation women's magazine "McCall's," Kael (as "Newsweek" put it in a 1966 profile) "went mass."Brantley (1996). p. 3-4. That same year, she wrote a blistering review of the phenomenally popular "The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music" in "McCall's". After mentioning that some of the press had dubbed it "The Sound of Money," Kael called the film's message a "sugarcoated lie that people seem to want to eat." p. 214-5. Although according to legend this review led to her being fired from "McCall's" (and "The New York Times" printed as much in Kael's obituary), both Kael and the magazine's editor, Robert Stein, denied this. According to Stein, he fired her "months later, after she kept panning every commercial movie from "Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia" and "Doctor Zhivago (film)|Dr. Zhivago" to "The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker" and "A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night"." Her dismissal from "McCall's" led to a stint from 1966 to 1967 at "The New Republic," whose editors continually altered Kael's writing without her permission. In October 1967, Kael wrote a lengthy essay on "Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde", which the magazine declined to publish.{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/609140/bonnie-and-clyde-pauline-kael-and-the-essay-that-changed-film-criticism|title='Bonnie and Clyde,' Pauline Kael, and the Essay That Changed Film Criticism|date=August 11, 2017|work=Flavorwire|access-date=November 5 ...
