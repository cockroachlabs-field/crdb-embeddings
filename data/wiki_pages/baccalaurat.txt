    File:Bac diplome0001.jpg|thumb|right|A diploma of "baccalauréat général"; it is issued by the "recteur d'académie" by delegation from the Minister of National Education. The ""baccalauréat"" (; ), often known in France colloquially as the ""bac"", is a French national academic qualification that students can obtain at the completion of their Secondary education in France|secondary education (at the end of the "lycée") by meeting certain requirements. Though it has only existed in its present form as a school-leaving examination since Napoleon Bonaparte's implementation on March 17, 1808, its origins date back to the first medieval French universities. According to French law, the baccalaureate is the first academic degree, though it grants the completion of secondary education. Historically, the baccalaureate is administratively supervised by full professors at universities.  Similar academic qualifications exist elsewhere in Europe, variously known as "Abitur" in Germany, "maturità" in Italy, "Spanish Baccalaureate|bachillerato" in Spain. There is also the European Baccalaureate, which students take at the end of the European School education. In France, there are three main types of "baccalauréat", which are very different and obtained in different places: the "baccalauréat général" (general baccalaureate), the "baccalauréat technologique" (technological baccalaureate), and the "baccalauréat professionnel" (professional baccalaureate). ==Overview== Much like the European "Matura" or English Advanced Level (UK)|A levels, the "baccalauréat" allows French and international students to obtain a standardised qualification, typically at the age of 18 (end of the "lycée"). It qualifies holders to work in certain areas, go on to tertiary education ("universités"), or acquire some other professional qualification or training. Even though it is not legally required, the vast majority of students in their final year of secondary school take a final exam. The word "bac" is also used to refer to one of the end-of-year exams that students must pass to get their "baccalauréat" diploma: the "bac de philo", for example, is the philosophy exam, which all students must take, regardless of their field of study. Within France, there are three main types of "baccalauréat" obtained in different places, and which are completely different: *the "baccalauréat général" (general baccalaureate), specially made to enter university and continue studies; *the "baccalauréat technologique" (technological baccalaureate), specially made to work or continue short technical studies; *the "baccalauréat professionnel" (professional baccalaureate), specially made to enter professional life. For entrance to regular universities within France, however, there are some restrictions as to the type of "baccalauréat" that can be presented. In some cases, it may be possible to enter a French university without the "bac" by taking a special exam, the "diploma for entrance to higher education". Though most students take the "bac" at the end of secondary school, it is also possible to enter as a "candidat libre" (literally, "free candidate") without affiliation to a school. Students who did not take the "bac" upon completion of secondary school (or did not manage to pass it) and would like to attend university, or feel that the "bac" would help them accomplish professional aspirations, may exercise that option. =="Baccalauréat général" (Pre-2019 reform)== The main purpose of the general baccalaureate is to access List of public universities in France|universities and "grandes écoles" to pursue higher academic education. It attests to an advanced level in general skills. It is obtained in a "Lycée général". Before 2021, students who would sit for the "baccalauréat général" chose one of three streams (termed "séries") in their penultimate "lycée" year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). Each stream assigned different weights ("coefficients") to each subject and resulted in a specialization. The streams of the "Baccalauréat général" before 2021 were as follows: {| class="wikitable" |- ! style="width:33%" | L <br />"Littéraire"<br /> (Literature) ! style="width:33%" | S <br /> S"cientifique"<br /> (Sciences) ! style="width:33%" | ES <br />"sciences Économiques et Sociales"<br /> (Economics and Social sciences) |-  | The "bac L" ("bac littéraire") weighs French literature, philosophy, foreign languages and The arts|arts heavily. | The sciences stream ("bac S" or "bac scientifique") requires a high level in mathematics, physics & chemistry, biology & geology and, if available, Engineering|engineering sciences and computer science. | The "bac ES" ("bac économique et social") requires a high level in economics & Social science|social sciences; and also in mathematics, history & geography.  |} Another terminology is sometimes used that pertains to the curriculum before 1994, which further divided two of the "séries". Until then, it was possible to sit for a "bac C" or "D" (which comprise the current S), a "bac B" (currently ES), or a "bac" "A1, A2" or "A3" (which comprise the current L). People who passed the "baccalauréat" before the reform still use that terminology in referring their diploma. The "baccalauréat" permits students to sit exams in over forty languages, including French regional languages such as Alsatian language|Alsatian, Breton language|Breton, Catalan language|Catalan or Norman language|Norman.  Students in the L stream prepare for careers in education, linguistics, literature, philosophy, public services|public service, Political Science|politics, sociology, management, business administration, law, and economics. The main and important subjects of this stream are Economics & Social science|Social Sciences, History & Geography, and Mathematics. They also have interests in the arts. The most important subjects in the literary stream are Philosophy, French language, French literature|Literature, Arts and other Languages, usually English, German and Spanish. {| class="wikitable" !style="width:30em;"|Subjects !Weight !Format of exam !Duration |- ! colspan="4" | Anticipated subjects<sup>a</sup> |- | French Language & Literature | 3 | Written | 4 hours |- | French Language & Literature | 2 | Oral | 30 minutes of preparation plus 20 minutes |- | Sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology)<br>(same school curricula as ES stream) | 2 | Written | 1 hours |- |- | "Travaux personnels encadrés" (TPE; Supervised Personal Work) | 2<sup>c</sup> | Oral | Ten minutes for each pupil (TPE is an exam generally prepared by groups of 3 pupils) |-  ! colspan="4" | "Terminale" subjects |- | Philosophy | 7 | Written | 4 hours |- | Literature | 4 | Written | 2 hours |- | History & Geography (same school curricula as ES stream) | 4 | Written | 4 hours |- | First Foreign Language (LV1) | 4 | Written | 3 hours |- | Second Foreign Language (LV2) "or" Regional Language (LVR) | 4 | Written | 3 hours |- | Physical Education | 2 | colspan="2" | Year-end average |- | Foreign Literature in Foreign Language (LV1 "or" LV2) (LELE) | 1 | Oral | 10 minutes |- ! colspan="4" | Specializations |- | Detailed LV1 "or" LV2 | +4 | Oral | 20 minutes |- | Third Foreign Language (Chinese, Italian, ...) | 4 | Oral | 20 minutes |- | Law and Major Issues of the Contemporary World (DGEMC or "droit") | 4 | Oral | 20 minutes |- | Latin "or" Ancient Greek | 4 | Written  | 3 hours |- | Mathematics | 3 | Written | 3 hours |- | Arts & Crafts "or" Cinema & Audiovisual Studies "or" Art History "or" Music "or" Theatre & Dramatic Expression "or" Dance  | 6 | Written and oral | 3½ hours and ½-hour |- | Supplementary Physical Education | 2 | colspan="2" | Year-end average |- ! colspan="4" | Optional subjects<sup>c</sup> |- | Foreign Language | rowspan="6" | 2<sup>b</sup> | Oral or written (depending on the language) | 20 minutes or 2 hours |- | Regional Language | Oral | 20 minutes |- | Latin | Oral | 15 minutes |- | Ancient Greek | Oral | 15 minutes |- | Physical Education | colspan="2" | Year-end average or examination |- | Arts (can be Fine Art "or" Cinema & Audiovisual Studies) | Oral | 30–40 minutes |- | colspan="4" | |}  The S stream prepares students for work in scientific fields such as medicine, engineering and the natural sciences.
