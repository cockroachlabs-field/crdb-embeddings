The family includes about 86 Extant taxon|extant species of ocean|marine fish living in tropical seas, usually around coral reefs. Many of the species are brightly colored and popular in aquarium|aquaria. ==Morphology== The distinctive characteristic of the family is that they have scalpel-like Fish scale#Modified scales|modified scales, one or more on either side of the Caudal peduncle|peduncle of the tail.Sorenson, L., Santini, F., Carnevale, G. and Alfaro, M.E. (2013) "A multi-locus timetree of surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae, Percomorpha), with revised family taxonomy". "Molecular phylogenetics and evolution", "68"(1): 150–160.  The spines are dangerously sharp and may seriously injure anyone who carelessly handles such a fish. The dorsal fin|dorsal, anal fin|anal, and caudal fins are large, extending for most of the length of the body. The mouths are small and have a single row of teeth adapted to grazing on algae. Surgeonfishes sometimes feed as solitary individuals, but they often travel and feed in schools. Feeding in schools may be a mechanism for overwhelming the highly aggressive defense responses of small territorial damselfishes that vigorously guard small patches of algae on coral reefs.

Most species are fairly small, with a maximum length of , but some in the genus "Acanthurus", some in the genus "Prionurus", and most species in the genus "Naso" may grow larger; the whitemargin unicornfish ("Naso annulatus") is the largest species in the family, reaching a length of up to . These fishes may grow quickly in aquaria, so average growth size and suitability should be checked before adding them to any marine aquarium. ==Evolution and fossil record== There are several extinct genera known from fossils dating from the Eocene to Miocene:  *"Proacanthurus" *"Tylerichthys" *"Gazolaichthys" *"Naseus" *"Tauichthys" *"Eorandallius" *"Metacanthurus"  *"Glarithurus" *"Caprovesposus" *"Arambourgthurus" *?"Eonaso"  *"Marosichthys" ==Etymology and taxonomic history== The name of the family is derived from the Greek words "akantha" and "oura", which loosely translate to "thorn" and "tail", respectively. This refers to the distinguishing characteristic of the family, the "scalpel" found on the caudal peduncle. In the early 1900s, the family was called "Hepatidae". == In the aquarium ==  Tangs are very sensitive to disease in the home aquarium. However, if the tang is fed enough algae and the aquarium is properly maintained disease should not be a problem. It is usually necessary to quarantine the animals for a period before introducing them to the aquarium. Adults range from  in length and most grow quickly even in aquaria. When considering a tang for an aquarium it is important to consider the size to which these fish can grow. Larger species such as the popular Paracanthurus hepatus|Pacific blue tang surgeonfish (of "Finding Nemo" fame), "Naso (fish)|Naso" or lipstick tang, Acanthurus lineatus|lined surgeonfish, Acanthurus sohal|Sohal surgeonfish and Acanthurus coeruleus|Atlantic blue tang surgeonfish can grow to  and require swimming room and hiding places. Many also suggest adding aggressive tangs to the aquarium last as they are territorial and may fight and possibly kill other fish. Tangs primarily graze on macroalgae from genera such as "Caulerpa" and "Gracilaria", although they have been observed in an aquarium setting to eat meat-based fish foods. A popular technique for aquarists, is to grow macroalgae in a sump or Refugium (population biology)|refugium. This technique not only is economically beneficial, but serves to promote enhanced water quality through nitrate absorption. The growth of the algae can then be controlled by feeding it to the tang. ==Gallery== <gallery widths="220" caption="Selected species"> File:Acanthurus achilles1.jpg|Achilles tang, "Acanthurus achilles" File:Acanthurus dussumieri.jpg|Eyestripe surgeonfish, "Acanthurus dussumieri" File:Acanthurusleucosternon-Weißkehl.jpg|Powderblue surgeonfish, "Acanthurus leucosternon" File:Acanthurus tennenti Kreisdorn-Doktorfisch3.jpg|Doubleband surgeonfish, "Acanthurus tennenti" File:Ctenochaetus strigosus 1.jpg|Kole tang, "Ctenochaetus strigosus" File:Naso vlamingii - Masken-Nasendoktorfisch imponierend.jpg|Naso vlamingii|Bignose unicornfish, "Naso vlamingii" File:Nasounicornis-Blauklingen.jpg|Bluespine unicornfish, "Naso unicornis" File:Zebrasoma desjardinii Indischer Segelflossendoktora.jpg|Red Sea sailfin tang, "Zebrasoma desjardinii" File:OrangeBand Surgeonfish.jpg|Orangespot surgeonfish, "Acanthurus olivaceus", being cleaned by two Hawaiian cleaner wrasse, "Labroides phthirophagus" File:Paracanthurus hepatus (Regal Tang).jpg|Paracanthurus hepatus|Regal tang, "Paracanthurus hepatus" in an aquarium </gallery> ==References==  ==External links== *  *  *    Category:Acanthuridae|  Category:Perciformes families Category:Marine fish families Category:Taxa named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines
