The only town on the Dingle Peninsula, it sits on the Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast, about  southwest of Tralee and  northwest of Killarney.Kerry County Council 2006:1 Principal industries in the town are tourism, fishing and agriculture: Dingle Mart (livestock market) serves the surrounding countryside. In 2016 Dingle had a population of 2,050 with 13.7% of the population speaking Irish on a daily basis outside the education system. Dingle is situated in a "Gaeltacht" region. An adult Bottlenose dolphin named Fungie had been courting human contact in Dingle Bay since 1983 but disappeared in 2020. ==History== A large number of Ogham stones were set up in an enclosure in the 4th and 5th centuries AD at Ballintaggart Ogham Stones|Ballintaggart. The town developed as a port following the Norman invasion of Ireland. By the thirteenth century, more goods were being exported through Dingle than Limerick, and in 1257 an ordinance of Henry III of England|King Henry III imposed customs on the port's exports.McKenna 1986:19–20, Coppage et al 1986:380 By the fourteenth century, importing wine was a major business. Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond|The 1st Earl of Desmond, who held Count palatine|palatine powers in the area, imposed a tax on this activity around 1329.McKenna 1986:20 By the sixteenth century, Dingle was one of Ireland's main trading ports, exporting fish and hides and importing wines from the continent of Europe. French and Spanish fishing fleets used the town as a base. Connections with Spain were particularly strong, and in 1529 Thomas Fitzgerald, 11th Earl of Desmond|The 11th Earl of Desmond and the ambassador of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V signed the Treaty of Dingle. Dingle was also a major embarkation port for pilgrims to travel to the shrine of James, son of Zebedee|Saint James at Santiago de Compostela. The parish church was rebuilt in the sixteenth century under "Spanish patronage" and dedicated to the saint.McKenna 1986:60Coppage et al, 1986:381 In 1569 the commerce of the town was increased when it was listed as one of fifteen towns or cities which were to have a monopoly on the import of wine.  The Dingle Peninsula was the scene of much of the military activity of 1579–80. On 17 July 1579 James FitzMaurice FitzGerald brought a small fleet of ships to Dingle. He made landfall, launching the Second Desmond Rebellion, but was to die soon after in a minor skirmish with the forces of a cousin.McKenna 1986:23 The fleet left the town after three days, anchoring at "Dún an Óir" at the western end of the peninsula, leading eventually to the Siege of Smerwick of 1580.  The residents of Dingle applied in 1569 for a "murage grant" to construct Defensive wall|walls around the town. The grant was not forthcoming on that occasion. Following the defeat of the Desmond Rebellion, Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth directed that a royal charter be granted to incorporate the town as a borough, and to allow for the construction of walls. Traces of these town walls can still be seen, while the street layout preserves the pattern of burgage plots. Although Elizabeth intended to grant a charter, the document was only obtained in 1607. On 2 March of that year her successor, James I of England|James I, sealed the charter, although the borough and its corporation had already been in existence for twenty-two years.McKenna 1986:31–33 The head of the corporation was the sovereign, fulfilling the role of a mayor. In addition to the sovereign, who was elected annually on the Michaelmas|Feast of St Michael, the corporation consisted of twelve burgess (title)|burgesses. The area of jurisdiction of the corporation was all land and sea within two Mile#Irish mile|Irish miles of the parish church. The borough also had admiralty jurisdiction over Dingle, Ventry, Ard na Caithne|Smerwick and Ballyferriter|Ferriter's Creek "as far as an arrow would fly". The charter also created Dingle a parliamentary borough, or Dingle (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|constituency, electing two members to the Irish House of Commons|House of Commons of the Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament.

The town started to recover in the eighteenth century, due to the efforts of the Fitzgerald family, Knight of Kerry|Knights of Kerry, who established themselves at "The Grove" at this time. Robert Fitzgerald imported flax seed and by 1755 a flourishing linen industry had been established, with cloth worth £60,000 produced annually. The trade collapsed following the Industrial Revolution|industrial production of cotton in Great Britain, and was virtually extinct by 1837.McKenna, 1986:45–47 The town fell victim to a cholera plague in 1849.  Dingle is a major fishing port, and the industry dates back to about 1830. The 1870s saw major development, when "Nobby (boat)|nobby" fleets from the Isle of Man came in search of mackerel. Lowestoft herring trawlers subsequently joined the fleet, allowing for a longer fishing season. The pier and maritime facilities were developed by the Congested Districts Board for Ireland|Congested Districts Board, and the arrival of rail transport in 1891 allowed for the transport of fish throughout the country, and a canning and curing industry developed.
