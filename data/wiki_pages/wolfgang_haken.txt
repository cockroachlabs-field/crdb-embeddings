His father was Werner Haken, a physicist who had Max Planck as a doctoral thesis advisor.Werner Haken, . Accessed May 6, 2019 In 1953, Haken earned a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from University of Kiel|Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel (Kiel University) and married Anna-Irmgard von Bredow, who earned a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the same university in 1959. In 1962, they left Germany so he could accept a position as visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He became a full professor in 1965, retiring in 1998.   In 1976, together with colleague Kenneth Appel at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Haken solved the four-color theorem. They proved that any two-dimensional map, with certain limitations, can be filled in with four colors without any adjacent “countries” sharing the same color. Haken has introduced several ideas, including Haken manifolds, 3-manifold#Foundational results|Kneser-Haken finiteness, and an expansion of the work of Hellmuth Kneser|Kneser into a theory of normal surfaces. Much of his work has an algorithmic aspect, and he is a figure in algorithmic topology. One of his key contributions to this field is an algorithm to detect if a knot is unknotted. Haken's eldest son, Armin, proved that there exist Propositional formula|propositional Tautology (logic)|tautologies that require Resolution (logic)|resolution proofs of exponential size.Avi Wigderson, Mathematics and Computation, March 27 2018, footnote at Theorem 6.11 Haken's eldest daughter, Dorothea Blostein, is a professor of computer science, known for her discovery of the master theorem (analysis of algorithms)|master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences. Haken’s second son, Lippold, is the inventor of the Continuum Fingerboard. Haken’s youngest son, Rudolf, is a professor of music, who established the world's first Electric Violin|Electric Strings university degree program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Accessed November 15, 2022 Wolfgang is the cousin of Hermann Haken, a physicist known for laser theory and synergetics.  In 1978, Haken delivered an invited address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki.. International Mathematical Union.
