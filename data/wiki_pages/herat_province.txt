Together with Badghis Province|Badghis, Farah Province|Farah, and Ghor Province|Ghor provinces, it makes up the north-western region of Afghanistan. Its primary city and administrative capital is Herat|Herat City. The province of Herat is divided into about 17 Districts of Afghanistan|districts and contains over 2,000 villages. It has a population of about 3,780,000, making it the second most populated province in Afghanistan behind Kabul Province. The population is Multiethnic society|multi-ethnic but largely Persian-speaking. Herat dates back to the Avestan times and was traditionally known for its wine. The city has a number of historic sites, including the Herat Citadel and the Musalla Complex. During the Middle Ages Herat became one of the important cities of Khorasan, as it was known as the Pearl of Khorasan. The province of Herat shares a border with Iran in the west and Turkmenistan in the north, making it an important trading region. The Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline (TAPI) is expected to pass through Herat from Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India in the south. The province has two airports, one is the Herat International Airport in the capital of Herat and the other is at the Shindand Air Base, which is one of the largest military bases in Afghanistan. The Salma Dam which is fed by the Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River is also located in this province. ==History==   The region of Herat was historically part of Greater Khorasan, which was successively controlled by the Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids followed by the Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids, Ilkhanates, Timurid dynasty|Timurids, Safavid dynasty|Safavids, Hotaki dynasty|Hotakis, Afsharid dynasty|Afsharids, Durrani Empire|Durranis, Qajar dynasty|Qajarids until it became part of the modern state of Afghanistan.

During the 19th century, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British arrived from southern Afghanistan as part of the "Great Game" and backed up the Afghans during one Siege of Herat (1838)|Persian siege and Anglo-Persian War|one capture of the city, the former in 1838, and the latter in 1856 in order to prevent Persian or Russian Empire|Russian influence reaching deeper in South Asia, and also, more importantly, British Raj|Britain's colony in India as part of the Great Game. The situation in province then remained quiet and uneventful until the 1979 Soviet Union|Soviet Soviet–Afghan War|invasion of Afghanistan. The province saw a number of battles during the 1980s Soviet war, and remained an active area of guerrilla warfare throughout, with local mujahideen commander Ismail Khan leading resistance against the Soviet-backed Afghan government. This continued until the Soviet Union withdrew all its forces in 1989. When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, Ismail Khan became the governor of the province, a position he retained until the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Taliban forces from the south took control of the province in 1995. Following the ousting of the Taliban and establishment of the Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration, led by Hamid Karzai, Ismail Khan once again became governor of Herat. Ismail Khan become a figure of controversy when the media began reporting that he was attempting to restrict freedom of the people, and that he was becoming more of an independent ruler as a warlord. He lost a son Mirwais Sadiq in 2004 during a fight with forces of other warlords. In response to this, the central government began expanding into the province with the newly trained Afghan National Security Forces (ANFS). Ismail Khan was ordered to leave his post to become a minister and live in Kabul. After 2005, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) established presence in the area to help assist the Afghan government. It is led by Italy. A multi-national Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) was also established to help the local population of the province. The United States established a consulate in Herat, NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|trained Afghan security forces, built schools, and clinics. Herat was one of the first seven areas that transitioned security responsibility from NATO to Afghanistan. On 21 July 2011, Afghan security forces assumed lead security responsibility from NATO. On the occasion, Minister of Defence Wardak told the audience, "this is our national responsibility to take over our security and defend our country." ==Economy==  The province is home to 90% of Afghanistan's Saffron production (a $12 million industry in 2014). In 2015 the World Bank noted that saffron cultivation had provided Herat Province's farmers a steady source of income, jobs for both men and women, and a decreased dependency on poppy cultivation. With international borders to Iran and Turkmenistan and an Herat International Airport|international airport, trade could potentially play an important part in the economy of Herat Province. Due to the lack of urbanization in Herat Province, around 75% of the population lives in rural areas and economic activity is correspondingly heavily reliant on agriculture and horticulture production (saffron, rugs, cumin, marble, animal skins and wool) with around 82% of economic activity coming from these fields in 2011. Marble manufacturing and light industry comprised the remaining areas of economic activity. ==Healthcare==  The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 31% in 2005 to 28% in 2011.  The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 24% in 2005 to 25% in 2011. ==Education==  The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 36% in 2005 to 25% in 2011. The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 55% in 2005 to 52% in 2011. Herat University is Afghanistan's second largest university with over 10,000 students, 14 faculties and 45 departments in 2014. ==Demographics==  As of 2020, the total population of the province is about 2,187,169, the majority of which live in rural parts.
