  File:Rice chaffs.jpg|300px|thumb|Rice chaff "Chaff" (; ) is the dry, scaly protective hull (botany)|casing of the seeds of cereal grains or similar fine, dry, scaly plant material (such as scaly parts of flowers or finely chopped straw). Chaff is indigestible by humans, but livestock can eat it. In agriculture it is used as livestock fodder, or is a waste material ploughed into the soil or burned. ==Etymology==  "Chaff" comes from Middle English "chaf", from Old English language|Old English , related to Old High German "cheva", "husk". ==Grain chaff==  Image:Usdaeinkorn1 Triticum monococcum.jpg|thumbnail|Spikelets of a hulled wheat, Einkorn wheat|einkornIn Poaceae|grasses (including cereals such as rice, barley, oats, and wheat), the ripe seed is surrounded by thin, dry, scaly bracts (called glumes, Lemma (botany)|lemmas and palea (botany)|paleas), forming a dry husk (or hull) around the grain. Once it is removed it is often referred to as chaff. In wild cereals and in the primitive domesticated einkorn,Potts, D. T.

The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called "threshing" – traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called "winnowing" – traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away. This method typically utilizes a broad, plate-shaped basket or similar receptacle to hold and collect the winnowed grain as it falls back down. Domesticated grains such as durum wheat and common wheat have been bred to have chaff that is easily removed. These varieties are known as "free-threshing" or "naked". Chaff should not be confused with bran, which is finer scaly material that is part of the grain itself. ==Straw chaff== Chaff is also made by chopping straw (or sometimes coarse hay) into very short lengths, using a machine called a chaff cutter.  Like grain chaff this is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock.: detail of painting by David Teniers the Younger  ==Botany== In botany, chaff refers to the thin List of plant morphology terms#Basic flower parts|receptacular bracts of many species in the sunflower family Asteraceae and related families. They are modified scale-like leaves surrounding single florets in the flower-head. ==Metaphor== Chaff as a waste product from grain processing leads to a metaphorical use of the term, to refer to something seen as worthless. In the Bible, such use is found in Job 13:25, Isaiah 33:11, Psalm 83:13-15, and other places. Chaff also lends its name to Chaff (countermeasure)|a radar countermeasure, composed of small particles dropped from an aircraft. ==Use== Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has discovered that the use of chaff-based filters can reduce the arsenic content of water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from an underground aquifer.
