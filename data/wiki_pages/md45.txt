The band released only one album, 1996's "The Craving (album)|The Craving".  In 2004, while remixing the Megadeth catalog, Mustaine omitted all vocals and harmonica parts from Ving. Instead, Mustaine himself recorded the vocals, and played guitar where the harmonica should've been. In this 2011 autobiography, Mustaine said:  In 2020, Ving publicly manifested his disapproval, saying in a podcast that he was never consulted about the changes, and Mustaine didn't contact him in any way. The remastered version was released by Capitol Records. == Lineup == *Lee Ving – vocals, harmonica (original issue) *Dave Mustaine – guitar (on both issues), vocals (on remastered issue) *Kelly LeMieux – bass *Jimmy DeGrasso – drums ;Other *Michael Kaye – guitar/backline technician *Billy Moss – studio engineer/vintage recorders == Discography == {| class="wikitable" |- |"Date of release" |"Title" |"Label" |"Chart positions" |"US sales" |- |July 23, 1996 |"The Craving (album)|The Craving" |Slab Records | |53,000 |- |July 24, 2004 |"The Craving" (remastered) |Capitol Records | | |} == References ==     Category:Megadeth Category:American heavy metal musical groups
