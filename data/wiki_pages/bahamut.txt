   File:Al Qazwini Cosmology.jpg|thumb|280px|The fish (Bahamut) carries on its back the giant bull (Kuyuta), and on the green hyacinth slab stands an earth-bearing angel.}}}} "Bahamut", or "Bahamoot" ( ; ), is a monster that lies deep below, underpinning the support structure that holds up the earth, according to <!--Arabian mythology-->Zakariya al-Qazwini. In this conception of the world, the earth is shouldered by an angel, who stands on a slab of gemstone, which is supported by the cosmic beast (ox) sometimes called Kujata (mythology)|Kuyutha'(/Kuyuthan)/Kiyuban/Kibuthan (most likely from a corruption or misrendering of Hebrew לִוְיָתָן "Leviathan"). Bahamut carries this bull on its back, and is suspended in water for its own stability. "Balhūt"<!--()Arabic text needs verification (confirmed as a geographic name, but not as whale's name)--> is a variant name found in some cosmographies. In the earliest sources, the name is "Lutīyā", with Balhūt given as a Kunya (Arabic)|byname and Bahamūt as a laqab|nickname. ==Orthography== "Bahamūt" is the spelling given in Zakariya al-Qazwini|al-Qazwini (d. 1283)'s cosmography., p. 216 and note 198. "Bahamoot" is Edward William Lane|Edward Lane's transcribed spelling.<!--Lane, p. 107--> "Balhūt" is the alternate spelling given in Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)'s geographic work and copies of Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1348)'s work. }}<!---"Bahmūt (=Bahamūt)" occurs in some printed editions of Ibn al-Wardi.--> The name is thought to derive from the biblical Behemoth. It has thus been translated as "Behemot" (German for "Behemoth") by Carl Hermann Ethé|Ethé. However, the original biblical Behemoth never appeared as a fish., pp. 237–238 and note 271, citing Heinen, Islamic Cosmology, p. 235 for the statement "in none of these ancient texts is Behemoth a fish" A reshaping of its nature must have occurred in Arab storytelling, some time in the pre-islamic period. One proposed scenario is that a pair of beasts from the Bible were confused with each other; the behemoth mis-assigned to the fish, and the aquatic leviathan to the bull. ==Lane's summary== Bahamut, according to Lane's abstract of a particular cosmology in medieval Islam#Cosmography|Islamic work on cosmography, is a giant fish acting as one of the layers that supports the earth. It is so immense " the seas of the world, placed in one of the fish's nostrils, would be like a mustard seed laid in the desert." Above the fish stands a bull called Kujata (bull)|Kuyootà, on the bull, a "ruby" rock, on the rock an angel to shoulder the earth. Below the Bahamut (Leviathan) is the colossus serpentine Falak (Arabian legend)|Falak. Lane's primary Islamic source for his summary is unclear, as Lane merely refers to it ly as "the work of one of the writers above quoted". ==Arabic sources==  There are a number of Islamic cosmographical treatises, of more or less similar content. There can occur certain discrepancies in Western translations, even when there are no textual differences in the Arabic. The creature, named Bahamut or Balhut in these sources, can be described as a fish or whale according to translation, since the original Arabic word "hūt" (حوت) can mean either. Also, the gem comprising the slab beneath the angel's feet, in Arabic "yāqūt" () is of ambiguous meaning, and can be rendered as "ruby", or variously otherwise. or "rock",""Felsen aus grünem Hyacinth"", in the Ethé's German translation of Qazwini,  or "green jacinth",Streck's summary of Qazwini,  "green corundum", or "green rock".}}  = Al-Damiri (d. 1405) on authority of Wahb ibn Munabbih was one of Lane's sources, possibly the source of his main summary. His description of "Bahmût" (French translation) matches Lane's summary down to certain key details. However, there seems to be discrepancies in using "a heap of sand" (instead of "mustard") in the size analogy. |last=Ibn al-Mundir |first=Abū Bakr b.

Bull's names are "Kīyūbān () or Kibūthān" () in Wüstenfeld's edition, transcribes "Kīyūbān/Kibūthān" from Wüstenfeld ed., "I", p. 148 but also written "Kuyūthā" (كيوثاء ) in some version.}} However, it disagrees somewhat with Lane's description regarding what lies below the fish: water, air, then a region of darkness, and with respect to the bull's appendages. It should be cautioned that Qazwini's cosmography is known to exist in a variety of different manuscripts., "al-Ḳazwīnī", "Encyclopedia of Islām", p. 841. Both cosmographies provide the story as words spoken by Wahb ibn Munabbih,, p. 216 and note 199. so the descriptions should be similar at the core. In fact, Al-Damiri's version is considered to be mere redactions of Qazwini printed onto its margins., "al-Ḳazwīnī", "Encyclopedia of Islām", p. 844. = Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1348) ("Kharīdat al-ʿAjā'ib", "The Pearl of Wonders") is another source used by Lane, to give variant readings. Its chapter that includes the cosmography has been deemed a copy of Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)'s "Mu'jam al-Buldan", with similar wording, with some rearrangements, and very slight amounts of discrepant information., p. 19, note 4. "Balhūt" is the name of the great fish given in both Ibn al-Wardi, p. 216, note 198. ("Kharīdat", Cairo edition of AH1358/AD1939, published by Maṭbaʿat Muṣtafā al-Bābī al-Ḥalabī, pp. 16, 15)"Belhut" in the Latin translation of "Kharīdat"  and Yaqut., p. 34, note 4, where it states that in Ibn al-Wardi, "Kharīdat", p. 14 the spelling is given as "bahmūt". The "Kharīdat" here is that of the Cairo edition of AH1324/AD1906.}} Yakut and al-Wardi both say there is a layer of sandhill between the bull and the fish.: Ibn al-Wardī, Kharīdat al-ʿajāʾib, p. 16. They also describe what lies under the fish somewhat differently., p. 107, note 3. These texts connect the cosmic fish and bull with phenomena of nature, namely the waxing and ebbing of tides, maintenance of the sea-level, and earthquakes. The account which only connects concerns the bull states that its breathing causes the waxing and ebbing of the tides. ibn-Wardi,, p. 106, note 1. and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi|al-Tha'labi.}} And since the fish and the bull drink the water running off the earth into the sea, they counteract the tap-off causing sea-level to rise. But the beasts will eventually become engorged, when they will become agitated, or, it marks the advent of Judgment Day (Ibn al-Wardi, Yaqut).  There are two "Qisas Al-Anbiya|Qiṣaṣ al-anbīyāʾ" ("Lives of the Prophets"), one by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi|al-Tha'labi, known otherwise for his "Tafsir al-Thalabi", the other by Muḥammad al-Kisāʾī which are considered the oldest authorities containing similar cosmographical descriptions concerning the big fish and bull., note 1. In al-Tha'labi's text is an  on the whale having several names, as follows: "God created a large fish (nūn) which is a huge whale whose name (ism) is Lutīyā, by-name (kunyah) Balhūt, and nickname (laqab) Bahamūt". <!-- There are also commentary on the creatures in the body of literature called the "tafsir", or "exegisis" on the "Quran", which --> ==Earthquakes== Yakut also gives the account that Iblis almost incited the whale Balhūt into causing a quake, but God distracted it by sending gnats to its eyes. Or alternatively, God had sent a sword-like fish that bedazzled and captivated the giant fish. This account is also found in al-Tha'labi's "Qiṣaṣ al-anbīyāʾ", but in that version God forces the whale (Lutīyā) into submission by sending a creature that invaded through its nose and reached its brain; it also claims to be an anecdote on authority of Ka’b al-Ahbar|Kaʿb al-Aḥbār (d. 650s A.D.), a convert considered the earliest informant of Jewish-Muslim tradition to Arab writers. by Al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī (d. 1505) and the al-Jazzār (d. after 1576).}} Although this is an instance of an Arabic tale that ascribes the origins of earthquakes to the cosmic whale/fish supporting the earth, more familiar beliefs in medieval Arab associate the earthquake with the bull, or with Mount Qaf. Jorge Luis Borges has drawn parallels between Bahamut and the mythical Japanese fish "Jinshin-Uwo",, citing Post Wheeler|Wheeler, Post (1952) "The Sacred Scriptures Of The Japanese", p. 495. although the correct term is .
