     "Cumbric" was a variety (linguistics)|variety of the Common Brittonic language spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the "Hen Ogledd" or "Old North" in what is now the counties of Westmorland, Cumberland, northern Lancashire in Northern England and the southern Scottish Lowlands, alongside the Elmet|Kingdom of Elmet in modern day Yorkshire. It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. Place name evidence suggests Cumbric may also have been spoken as far south as Borough of Pendle|Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales. The prevailing view is that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland. ==Problems with terminology== Dauvit Broun sets out the problems with the various terms used to describe the Cumbric language and its speakers.Broun, Dauvit (2004): 'The Welsh identity of the kingdom of Strathclyde, ca 900-ca 1200', "Innes Review" 55, pp 111–80. The people seem to have called themselves  the same way that the Welsh called themselves  (most likely from reconstructed Brittonic  meaning "fellow countrymen"). The Welsh and the Cumbric-speaking people of what are now southern Scotland and northern England probably felt they were actually one ethnic group. Old Irish speakers called them "Britons", , or ."Dictionary of the Irish Language", Royal Irish Academy, 1983.  The Norse called them . In Latin, the terms  and  were Latinised as Cambria and Cumbria respectively. In Medieval Latin, the English term Welsh became  ("of Wales"), while the term  referred to Cumbrians ("of Cumbria").Forbes, A. P. (1874) "Lives of St. Ninian and St. Kentigern: compiled in the twelfth century" However, in Scots, a Cumbric speaker seems to have been called  – from the Scots  "Welsh".

(1843), "Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis; Munimenta Ecclesie Metropolitane Glasguensis a Sede Restaurata Seculo Incunte Xii Ad Reformatam Religionem", i, Edinburgh: The Bannatyne Club}} The Latinate term Cambria is often used for Wales; nevertheless, the "Life of St Kentigern" ( 1200) by Jocelyn of Furness has the following passage:  John T. Koch defined the specifically Cumbric region as "the area approximately between the line of the River Mersey and the Forth-Clyde Isthmus", but went on to include evidence from the Wirral Peninsula in his discussion and did not define its easterly extent. Kenneth H. Jackson described Cumbric as "the Brittonic dialect of Cumberland, Westmorland, northern Lancashire, and south-west Scotland" and went on to define the region further as being bound in the north by the Firth of Clyde, in the south by the River Ribble and in the east by the Southern Scottish Uplands and the Pennine Ridge. ==Available evidence== File:Scots lang-en.svg|thumb|Linguistic division in early twelfth century Scotland. The evidence from Cumbric comes almost entirely through secondary sources, since no known contemporary written records of the language survive. The majority of evidence comes from place names of the north of England and the south of Scotland. Other sources include the personal names of Strathclyde Britons in Scottish, Irish, and Anglo-Saxon sources, and a few Cumbric words surviving into the High Middle Ages in southwest Scotland as legal terms. Although the language is long extinct, traces of its vocabulary arguably have persisted into the modern era in the form of "Yan tan tethera|counting scores" and in a handful of dialectal words. From this scanty evidence, little can be deduced about the singular characteristics of Cumbric, not even the name by which its speakers referred to it. However, linguists generally agree that Cumbric was a Western Brittonic languages |Western Brittonic language closely related to Welsh language |Welsh and, more distantly, to Cornish language |Cornish and Breton language |Breton.Koch, John T. (ed.), "Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia", ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 516.Ball, Martin J.; Fife, James (eds.), "The Celtic Languages", Taylor & Francis, 2002, p. 6.Jackson, Kenneth H.  "Language and History in Early Britain", Edinburgh University press, 1953, p. 10. Around the time of the battle described in the poem "Y Gododdin", c. 600, Common Brittonic is believed to have been transitioning into its daughter languages: Cumbric in North Britain, Old Welsh in Wales, and Southwestern Brittonic languages|Southwestern Brittonic, the ancestor of Cornish and Breton.Davies (2005), p. 232. Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the fifth to the end of the sixth century.Jackson (1953), pp 3–11; 690. This involved Syncope (phonology)|syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem ultimately dates to this time, it would have originally been written in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd;Elliott (2005), p. 583. Jackson suggested the name "Primitive Cumbric" for the dialect spoken at the time.Jackson (1969), pp. 86, 90. However, scholars date the poem to between the 7th and the early 11th centuries, and the earliest surviving manuscript of it dates to the 13th, written in Old Welsh and Middle Welsh.  Cumbric place-names occur in Scotland south of the firths of Forth and Clyde. Brittonic names north of this line are Pictish language|Pictish. Cumbric names are also found commonly in the historic county of Cumberland and in bordering areas of Northumberland. They are less common in Westmorland, east Northumberland, and Durham, with some in Lancashire and the adjoining areas of North Yorkshire. Approaching Cheshire, late Brittonic placenames are probably better characterised as Welsh rather than as Cumbric. As noted below, however, any clear distinction between Cumbric and Welsh is difficult to prove. Many Brittonic place-names remain in these regions which should not be described as Cumbric, such as Leeds, Manchester and York, because they were coined in a period before Brittonic split into Cumbric and its sister dialects. Some of the principal towns and cities of the region have names of Cumbric origin, including: *"Bathgate", West Lothian: meaning 'boar wood' (Welsh  'wild boar' +  'forest, wood'). *Carlisle, Cumbria|"Carlisle", Cumbria: recorded as  in the Roman period; the word  'fort' was added later.Ekwall, E. (1960) "The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names", 4th ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press. The Welsh form  is derived by regular sound changes from the Romano-British name. *"Glasgow", Scotland: widely believed to derive from words cognate with Welsh  'green Hollow (landform)|hollow' (possibly that below Glasgow Cathedral). *"Lanark", Lanarkshire: from the equivalent of Welsh  'Glade (geography)|glade, clearing'. *"Penicuik", Midlothian: from words meaning 'hill of the cuckoo' (W. ). *"Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith", Cumbria: meaning 'chief Ford (crossing)|ford' (Welsh  'head, chief' +  'ford'). Several supposed Cumbric elements occur repeatedly in place names of the region. The following table lists some of them according to the modern Welsh equivalent: {| class="wikitable" |- !

Among the evidence that Cumbric might have influenced local English dialects are a group of counting systems, or scores, recorded in various parts of northern England. Around 100 of these systems have been collected since the 18th&nbsp;century; the scholarly consensus is that these derive from a Brittonic language closely related to Welsh.Filppula, Klemola, & Paulasto, pp. 102–105. Though they are often referred to as "sheep-counting numerals", most recorded scores were not used to count sheep, but in knitting or for List of traditional children ...
