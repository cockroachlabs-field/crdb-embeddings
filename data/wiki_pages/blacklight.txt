The violet glow of a black light is not the UV light itself, but visible light that escapes being filtered out by the filter material in the glass envelope. A "blacklight", also called a "UV-A light", "Wood's lamp", or "ultraviolet light",  is a lamp (fixture)|lamp that emits long-wave (UV-A) ultraviolet light and very little visible light.  One type of lamp has a violet light filter|filter material, either on the bulb or in a separate glass filter in the lamp housing, which blocks most visible light and allows through UV, so the lamp has a dim violet glow when operating.  Blacklight lamps which have this filter have a lighting industry designation that includes the letters "BLB".  This stands for "blacklight blue".   A second type of lamp produces ultraviolet but does not have the filter material, so it produces more visible light and has a blue color when operating.  These tubes are made for use in "bug zapper" insect traps, and are identified by the industry designation "BL". This stands for "blacklight". Blacklight sources may be specially designed fluorescent lamps, mercury-vapor lamps, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, or incandescent lamps.  In medicine, forensics, and some other scientific fields, such a light source is referred to as a Wood's lamp, named after Robert Williams Wood, who invented the original Wood's glass UV filters. Although many other types of lamp emit ultraviolet light with visible light, black lights are essential when UV-A light without visible light is needed, particularly in observing fluorescence, the colored glow that many substances emit when exposed to UV.  Black lights are employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects, diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine, the detection of substances tagged with fluorescent dyes, rockhound|rock-hunting, scorpion-hunting, the detection of counterfeit money, the curing of plastic resins, attracting insects and the detection of refrigerant leaks affecting refrigerators and air conditioning systems. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in tanning beds.   UV-A presents a potential hazard when eyes and skin are exposed, especially to high power sources. According to the World Health Organization, UV-A is responsible for the initial tanning of skin and it contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. UV-A may also contribute to the progression of skin cancers. Additionally, UV-A can have negative effects on eyes in both the short-term and long-term. ==Types==   Fluorescent black light tubes are typically made in the same fashion as normal fluorescent tubes except that a phosphor that emits UVA light instead of visible white light is used on the inside of the tube.  The type most commonly used for black lights, designated "blacklight blue" or "BLB" by the industry, has a dark blue filter coating on the tube, which filters out most visible light, so that fluorescence effects can be observed.   These tubes have a dim violet glow when operating. They should not be confused with "blacklight" or "BL" tubes, which have no filter coating, and have a brighter blue color.   These are made for use in "bug zapper" insect traps where the emission of visible light does not interfere with the performance of the product. The phosphor typically used for a near 368 to 371&nbsp;nanometer emission peak is either europium-doped strontium fluoroborate (:) or europium-doped strontium borate (:) while the phosphor used to produce a peak around 350 to 353&nbsp;nanometres is lead-doped barium silicate (:). "Blacklight blue" lamps peak at 365&nbsp;nm.   File:Black light bulb.jpg|thumb|left|Compact fluorescent lamp|Compact fluorescent (CF) black light bulb Manufacturers use different numbering systems for black light tubes. Philips uses one system which is becoming outdated (2010), while the (German) Osram system is becoming dominant outside North America. The following table lists the tubes generating blue, UVA and UVB, in order of decreasing wavelength of the most intense peak. Approximate phosphor compositions, major manufacturer's type numbers and some uses are given as an overview of the types available. "Peak" position is approximated to the nearest 10&nbsp;nm. "Width" is the measure between points on the shoulders of the peak that represent 50% intensity.  {| class="wikitable" |+Various phosphor compositions used in blacklight |- ! Phosphor<br/>Mixture !

Full width at half maximum|FWHM spectral bandwidth of the 370&nbsp;nm peak is about 20&nbsp;nm. The tiny secondary peak "(2)" is light from the mercury vapor line at 404&nbsp;nm leaking through the filter, which gives the lamp its purple glow. = Another class of UV fluorescent bulb is designed for use in "bug zapper" flying insect traps.  Insects are attracted to the UV light, which they are able to see, and are then electrocuted by the device. These bulbs use the same UV-A emitting phosphor blend as the filtered blacklight, but since they do not need to suppress visible light output, they do not use a purple filter material in the bulb. Plain glass blocks out less of the visible mercury emission spectrum, making them appear light blue-violet to the naked eye. These lamps are referred to by the designation "blacklight" or "BL" in some North American lighting catalogs.  These types are not suitable for applications which require the low visible light output of "BLB" tubes lamps.
