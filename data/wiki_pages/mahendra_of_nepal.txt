Following the 1960 Nepal coup d'√©tat|1960 coup d'√©tat, he established the partyless Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat system which governed the country for 28 years until the introduction of multiparty democracy in 1990. During his reign, Nepal experienced a period of industrial, political and economic change that opened it to the rest of the world for the first time after the 104-year-long reign of the Rana dynasty|Rana rulers, who had kept the country under an isolationist policy, came to an end in 1951. == Early life == File:Tribhuvan and sons 1932.jpg|thumb|During 1932 From left Crown Prince Mahendra, Prince Basundhara and Prince Himalaya Pratap together with their father King tribhuvan|left King Mahendra was born in the year 11 June 1920 (1977 B.S)  at the Narayanhiti Palace to King Tribhuvan of Nepal. King Mahendra was the eldest child of King Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan and Queen Kanti of Nepal|Queen Kanti. Under the Rana dynasty, the power of the king was reduced to that of a figurehead. Although Tribhuvan was nominally king since 1911, the royal family had been held captive in Narayanhiti Palace since the rise of the prominent Rana dynasty. Even though he had not take any official education, he took private education inside the palace and learned politics, economics and Nepali literature, history and culture. Inside the palace, King Mahendra had a love affair with a concubine, named Geeta Gurung through which a child was born at the age of 13.There was only one child named Rabindra Shah/Gurung. Since the concubine was not a Thakuri, his marriage could not take place and the royal family decided to marry their son with the Rana family. In 1940, He married Indra, Crown Princess of Nepal|Indra Rajya Lakshmi, the granddaughter of Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana and daughter of General Hari Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. Mahendra had three sons, Birendra, Gyanendra, and Dhirendra and three daughters Shanti, Sharada, and Shobha. His first wife, Indra, Crown Princess of Nepal|Crown Princess Indra died in 1950. In 1951 King Tribhuvan 1951 Nepalese revolution|launched a successful political movement against the Ranas and established Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal as a constitutional monarchy. Mahendra was not happy that King Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan had reduced the rights of the monarchy in the 1951 (2007 Bikram Sambat|B.S) Interim Constitution while bidding farewell to the Rana dynasty after the 1951 revolution. After the death of his first wife Indra Rajya Laxmi Devi|Indra Rajya in 1950, the then Prince Mahendra was in a love affair with sister in law, Queen Ratna of Nepal|Ratna, but King Tribhuvan was planning to prevent his son from marrying Rana's daughter Ratna under any circumstances. Prince Mahendra did not like the pressure of his father to marry the girl of his choice. King Tribhuvan, on the other hand, was not in favor of expanding relations with the Rana family, even more so with Shamsher's Clan. King Tribhuvan was outraged by the insult inflicted on him by Juddha Shamsher, but the dispute had been going on for a long time.  In 1952,two years after the death of his queen, Mahendra married Indra's younger sister, Queen Ratna of Nepal|Ratna Rajya Lakshmi Devi. This created bad relations between him and his father.
