  In category theory, a branch of mathematics, "duality" is a correspondence between the properties of a category "C" and the dual properties of the opposite category "C"<sup>op</sup>. Given a statement regarding the category "C", by interchanging the Domain of a function|source and Codomain|target of each morphism as well as interchanging the order of Function composition|composing two morphisms, a corresponding dual statement is obtained regarding the opposite category "C"<sup>op</sup>. Duality, as such, is the assertion that truth is invariant under this operation on statements. In other words, if a statement is true about "C", then its dual statement is true about "C"<sup>op</sup>. Also, if a statement is false about "C", then its dual has to be false about "C"<sup>op</sup>. Given a concrete category "C", it is often the case that the opposite category "C"<sup>op</sup> per se is abstract. "C"<sup>op</sup> need not be a category that arises from mathematical practice. In this case, another category "D" is also termed to be in duality with "C" if "D" and "C"<sup>op</sup> are Equivalence of categories|equivalent as categories. In the case when "C" and its opposite "C"<sup>op</sup> are equivalent, such a category is self-dual. ==Formal definition== We define the elementary language of category theory as the two-sorted first order language with objects and morphisms as distinct sorts, together with the relations of an object being the source or target of a morphism and a symbol for composing two morphisms. Let σ be any statement in this language. We form the dual σ<sup>op</sup> as follows:  # Interchange each occurrence of "source" in σ with "target". # Interchange the order of composing morphisms. That is, replace each occurrence of <math>g \circ f</math> with <math>f \circ g</math> Informally, these conditions state that the dual of a statement is formed by reversing morphism|arrows and function composition|compositions. "Duality" is the observation that σ is true for some category "C" if and only if σ<sup>op</sup> is true for "C"<sup>op</sup>. ==Examples== * A morphism <math>f\colon A \to B</math> is a monomorphism if <math>f \circ g = f \circ h</math> implies <math>g=h</math>. Performing the dual operation, we get the statement that <math>g \circ f = h \circ f</math> implies <math>g=h.</math> For a morphism <math>f\colon B \to A</math>, this is precisely what it means for "f" to be an epimorphism. In short, the property of being a monomorphism is dual to the property of being an epimorphism. Applying duality, this means that a morphism in some category "C" is a monomorphism if and only if the reverse morphism in the opposite category "C"<sup>op</sup> is an epimorphism. * An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a partial order. So if "X" is a Set (mathematics)|set and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤<sub>new</sub> by :: "x" ≤<sub>new</sub> "y" if and only if "y" ≤ "x". This example on orders is a special case, since partial orders correspond to a certain kind of category in which Hom("A","B") can have at most one element. In applications to logic, this then looks like a very general description of negation (that is, proofs run in the opposite direction). For example, if we take the opposite of a lattice theory|lattice, we will find that "meets" and "joins" have their roles interchanged. This is an abstract form of De Morgan's laws, or of Duality (order theory)|duality applied to lattices. * limit (category theory)|Limits and limit (category theory)|colimits are dual notions. * Fibrations and cofibrations are examples of dual notions in algebraic topology and homotopy theory. In this context, the duality is often called Eckmann–Hilton duality. ==See also== * Adjoint functor * Dual object * Duality (mathematics) * Opposite category * Pulation square ==References==  *  *  *  *  *   Category:Category theory Category:Duality theories|Category theory
