The word "overdose" implies that there is a common safe dosage and usage for the drug; therefore, the term is commonly applied only to drugs, not poisons, even though many poisons as well are harmless at a low enough dosage. Drug overdose is sometimes used as a means to commit suicide, as the result of intentional or unintentional misuse of medication. Intentional misuse leading to overdose can include using prescribed or non-prescribed drugs in excessive quantities in an attempt to produce euphoria. Usage of illicit drugs, in large quantities, or after a period of drug abstinence can also induce overdose.

The symptoms can often be divided into differing toxidromes. This can help one determine what class of drug or toxin is causing the difficulties. Symptoms of opioid overdoses include slow breathing, heart rate and pulse. Opioid overdoses can also cause pinpoint pupils, and blue lips and nails due to low levels of oxygen in the blood. A person experiencing an opioid overdose might also have muscle spasms, seizures and decreased consciousness. A person experiencing an opiate overdose usually will not wake up even if their name is called or if they are shaken vigorously. ==Causes== The Psychoactive drug|drugs or toxins that are most frequently involved in overdose and death (grouped by ICD-10):  * Acute alcohol intoxication (F10) ** Ethanol|Ethyl alcohol ** Methanol poisoning ** Ethylene glycol poisoning * Opioid overdose (F11) * Among sedative-hypnotics (F13) ** Barbiturate overdose (T42.3) ** Benzodiazepine overdose (T42.4) ** Uncategorized sedative-hypnotics (T42.6) *** Ethchlorvynol (Placidyl) *** gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB *** Glutethimide (Doriden) *** Methaqualone *** Ketamine (T41.2) * Among stimulants (F14-F15) ** Cocaine overdose (T40.5) ** Amphetamine#Overdose|Amphetamine overdose (T43.6) ** Methamphetamine#Overdose|Methamphetamine overdose (T43.6) * Among tobacco (F17) ** Nicotine poisoning (T65.2) * Among poly drug use (F19) ** Drug "cocktails" (Speedball (drug)|speedballs) * Medications ** Aspirin poisoning (T39.0) ** Paracetamol poisoning (Alone or mixed with oxycodone) ** Paracetamol toxicity (T39.1) ** Tricyclic antidepressant overdose (T43.0) ** Vitamin poisoning * Pesticide poisoning (T60) ** Organophosphate poisoning ** DDT#Effects on human health|DDT * Inhalants * Lithium toxicity   Masking undesired taste may impair judgement of the Potency (pharmacology)|potency, which is a factor in overdosing. For example, Lean (drug)|lean is usually created as a drinkable mixture, the cough syrup is combined with soft drinks, especially fruit-flavored drinks such as Sprite (drink)|Sprite, Mountain Dew or Fanta, and is typically served in a foam cup. A hard candy, usually a Jolly Rancher, may be added to give the mixture a sweeter flavor. ==Diagnosis== The substance that has been taken may often be determined by asking the person. However, if they will not, or cannot, due to an altered level of consciousness, provide this information, a search of the home or questioning of friends and family may be helpful. Examination for toxidromes, drug testing, or laboratory test may be helpful. Other laboratory test such as glucose, urea and electrolytes, paracetamol levels and salicylate levels are typically done. Negative drug-drug interactions have sometimes been misdiagnosed as an acute drug overdose, occasionally leading to the assumption of suicide. . ==Prevention== The distribution of naloxone to injection drug users and other opioid drug users decreases the risk of death from overdose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that U.S. programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its utilization are estimated to have prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths. Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the U.S. state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the U.S. military. Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers' insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the U.S. Supervised injection sites (also known as overdose prevention centers) have been used to help prevent drug overdoses by offering opioid reversal medications such as naloxone, medical assistance and treatment options. They also provide clean needles to help prevent the spread of diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. ==Management== File:CharcoalPO.jpg|thumb|Activated carbon is a commonly used agent for decontamination of the Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract in overdoses. Stabilization of the person's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC (medicine)|ABCs) is the initial treatment of an overdose.
