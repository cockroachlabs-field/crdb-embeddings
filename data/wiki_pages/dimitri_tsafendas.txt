Archived by WebCite at  Retrieved on 8 July 2009. Tsafendas, while working as a parliamentary messenger, stabbed Verwoerd to death during a sitting of the House of Assembly in Cape Town; Verwoerd is commonly regarded as the architect of Apartheid. ==Early life== Tsafendas was born in Lourenço Marques (today's Maputo) to Michalis Tsafandakis (, also spelled "Miguel Tsafandakis"), a Greeks|Greek marine engineer with Anarchism|anarchist leanings from Kitharida, a small village near Heraklion, Crete, and Amelia Williams, a Mozambican woman of Multiracial|mixed race. He was sent to Egypt when he was three to live with his grandmother and his aunt.Hollington, Kris. 2008. "Wolves, Jackals, and Foxes: The Assassins Who Changed History". New York: Macmillan, p. 116.  He returned to Mozambique four years later; then, at the age of ten, moved to Transvaal Province|Transvaal, where he attended Middelburg Primary School from 1928 to 1930. He then returned to Mozambique and attended a church school for the next two years. Tsafendas was familiar with politics from an early age. Several members of his family were Cretan rebels during the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)|Great Cretan Revolution (1866-1869), while his father was a passionate Anarchism|anarchist. At the age of 16, Tsafendas began to work at various jobs, and was dismissed from one of them "owing to his Communism|Communist leanings" and after he was suspected of being "engaged in disseminating Communistic propaganda." When he was 20, the Portuguese security police, PIDE, opened a file on Tsafendas after discovering that he had twice distributed Communist propaganda. In 1939, Tsafendas entered South Africa illegally and joined the South African Communist Party. He became a seaman in the U.S. Merchant Navy|merchant marine in 1941 and served aboard American ships during the World War II|Second World War.Robins, Jon. "The Assassin and the Tapeworm", "The New Statesman". London. 27 March 2000. While in the United States, Tsafendas became a member of a religious sect known as the Two by Twos. In 1947, the U.S. Immigration authorities deported Tsafendas to Greece, which was in the throes of a Greek Civil War|civil war. Joining the Democratic Army of Greece|Democratic Army, the military wing of the Communist Party of Greece|Greek Communist Party, Tsafendas fought with them against the royalists. Shortly before the war ended in defeat for the Communists, Tsafendas made his way to Portugal. Upon his arrival to the country, he was arrested and interrogated by the police about his political activities in Mozambique in 1938. He was imprisoned for nine months in the two most notorious Portuguese prisons for political offenders, the Barca d'Alva and the Aljuba Prison. In October 1951, Tsafendas travelled by sea to Lourenço Marques, but was refused entry because of his past political activities and for being a known Communist, and was deported back to Portugal. Banned from entering South Africa, where his family had gone to live in the late 1930s, and Mozambique, Tsafendas was forced to spend the next 12 years of his life in exile. Over these years he would apply at least once a year for permission to enter Mozambique or South Africa, but all his applications were refused because of his Communist status and his political activities in Mozambique in the 1930s. Constantly harassed in Portugal by PIDE and the Portuguese police, Tsafendas roamed across Europe and the Middle East, working and visiting places that interested him. Sometimes, when he was down and out, he would claim to be mentally ill so as to secure food and shelter. During his wanderings, he picked up eight languages. While in Turkey in 1961, he worked for some six months as a teacher of English at the Limasollu Naci College, a prestigious private language institute in Istanbul, and upon eventually securing his return to South Africa, he worked for a time as a translator at Durban Court. In 1962, during a visit to Crete to see his father's and ancestors' birthplace, he met Greek partisans from the Second World War who had participated in the Kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe|kidnapping of the Nazism|Nazi General Heinrich Kreipe, and they trained him in bomb-making. In 1963, Tsafendas was granted amnesty by the Portuguese after he convinced them that he was a reformed man and no longer a Communist, and he was eventually allowed to return to Mozambique. A year later, Tsafendas was arrested while addressing local people in favour of independence for the colonial territory. In a suitcase containing anti-colonialist and Communist literature, Tsafendas also had several Bibles. He told the police he was not advocating independence but preaching Christianity. The Portuguese were not convinced, and he was charged with "pretending to be a missionary spreading the word about religion" while actually preaching "under the guise of religion in favour of Mozambique's independence". According to PIDE's interrogation transcript, "When asked to describe all of the subversive activities that he has been developing against the Country and in favour of Mozambique's independence, he answered: That, he hasn't been developing any kind of such subversive activities against the Country, neither in favour of Mozambique's independence. However, wishes to clarify that he supports, as a Mozambican, the idea of Mozambique's independence, governed by the natives of that Province, whether they are black or white." The Portuguese were not convinced that Tsafendas was telling the truth, and he was imprisoned. After three months in custody, Tsafendas claimed that he was in fact a missionary, Saint Peter. He was taken to a hospital, where he convinced the Portuguese doctors that he really believed he was Jesus|Christ's foremost apostle and he was therefore considered to be insane. He was released from prison custody and soon afterwards released from the hospital. In 1965, Tsafendas returned to South Africa. Shortly before the assassination, he applied for reclassification from "White" to "Coloured" but his application was turned down., "The New York Times" (book review), 24 June 2001, by Jon Robins, "New Statesman", 27 March 2000 ==The assassination== In July 1966, at the age of forty-eight, Tsafendas obtained a temporary position as a parliamentary messenger in the House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly in Cape Town. When he first decided to take action against Verwoerd, Tsafendas planned to kidnap the prime minister. However, he soon realised that it would be impossible to do this on his own since his former comrades from the SACP were not keen on participating in anything risky or violent. With the access his new job permitted him, he decided instead to assassinate Verwoerd. He believed that since he had the opportunity to act he was morally obliged to do so, believing as he did that Verwoerd was "the brains behind apartheid" and that without him a change of policy would sooner or later take place. Years later, he told two priests who visited him in the hospital, "Every day, you see a man you know committing a very serious crime for which millions of people suffer. You cannot take him to court or report him to the police because he is the law in the country. Would you remain silent and let him continue with his crime or would you do something to stop him? You are guilty not only when you commit a crime, but also when you do nothing to prevent it when you have the chance." Tsafendas's initial plan was to shoot Verwoerd, escape in the confusion, hide in the "Eleni", a Greek tanker that was docked in Cape Town, and then sail away with it to freedom. Ultimately, his plan was to seek refuge in Communist Cuba. However, he had difficulty getting hold of a gun and with time running out and his temporary employment about to expire, he decided to use a knife to kill Verwoerd. On 6 September, Prime Minister Verwoerd entered the debating chamber of Parliament and made his way to his seat. Tsafendas approached him, drew a concealed sheath knife from his belt, and stabbed Verwoerd about four times in the torso before he was pulled away by other members of parliament.Morris, Michael and Linnegar, John with the South Africa Ministry of Education, Human Sciences Research Council, Social Cohesion & Integration Research Programme. 2004. "Every Step of the Way: the journey to freedom in South Africa". Cape Town: HSRC Press, pp. 184–185.  He had made no plan for escape and was easily apprehended. He was taken into police custody, where he was severely beaten, and then moved to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries and interviewed by a psychiatrist. Later, he was returned to jail pending trial. Throughout his time in custody Tsafendas was subjected to severe torture from beatings, electric shocks, mock hangings and pretended defenestrations. ==Reaction and police investigation== After the assassination, some leaders in the anti-apartheid movement distanced themselves from any association with Tsafendas. However, others like Johnny Makhatini leader of the African National Congress|ANC in Algiers, hailed the assassination as "the beginning of the end for apartheid" and said it would "help the morale of guerrilla fighters in South Africa (and) increase confusion among whites".{{Cite news|title=Murder shocks world, but some leaders a ...
