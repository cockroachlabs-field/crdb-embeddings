He might have been either the sacred king|sacred ruler or "kende" of the Hungarians, or their military leader or "Gyula (title)|gyula", although most details of his life are debated by historians, because different sources contain contradictory information. Despite this, many Hungarian people|Hungarians refer to him as the "founder of our country", and Árpád's preeminent role in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin has been emphasized by some later chronicles. The Árpád dynasty|dynasty descending from Árpád ruled the Kingdom of Hungary until 1301. ==Biography==   Árpád was the son of Álmos who is mentioned as the first head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes by all Hungarian chronicles. His mother's name and family are unknown. According to historian Gyula Kristó, Árpád was born around 845. His name derived from the Hungarian word for barley, "árpa". The Hungarians cohabited for centuries with Turkic people, which accounts for over 10% word roots in modern Hungarian being Turkic. In Hungarian, most pastoral terms are Turkic in origin, and agricultural terms are 50% r-Turkic. Many Hungarian names, and also animal and plant names, are of Turkic origin, and the majority of tribe names were of Turkic origin. Turkic is, along with Uralic, German and Slavic, one of the four languages that have the greatest percentage of word roots in the Hungarian language. However, the Magyars are not a Turkic people, though the Turks made a genetic and linguistic contribution.A MAGYAROK TÜRK MEGNEVEZÉSE BÍBORBANSZÜLETETT KONSTANTINOS DE ADMINISTRANDOIMPERIO CÍMÛ MUNKÁJÁBAN - Takács Zoltán Bálint, SAVARIAA VAS MEGYEI MÚZEUMOK ÉRTESÍTÕJE28 SZOMBATHELY, 2004, pp. 317–333 }} The Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (r.&nbsp;913–959) states that the Hungarians "had never at any time had any other prince" before Árpád, which is in sharp contrast to the Hungarian chronicles' report of the position of Árpád's father."Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio" (ch. 38), p. 173. In Porphyrogenitus's narration, the Khazar Khaganate|Khazar khagan initiated the centralization of the command of the Hungarian tribes in order to strengthen his own suzerainty over them. The khagan initially wanted to appoint a chieftain named Levedi to lead the Hungarians. However, Levedi did not accept this offer and suggested that either Álmos or Árpád should be promoted instead of him. The khagan approached the Hungarians with this new proposal. They preferred Árpád to his father, because he was "greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour, and capable of this rule". Thereafter, Árpád was made "prince according to the custom&nbsp;... of the Chazars, by lifting him upon a shield." Constantine Porphyrogenitus erroneously refers to the Magyars as Turks. This was a misnomer, as while the Magyars do have some Turkic genetic and cultural influence, and their historical social structure was of Turkic origin, they are not a Turkic peoples|Turkic people.A MAGYAROK TÜRK MEGNEVEZÉSE BÍBORBANSZÜLETETT KONSTANTINOS DE ADMINISTRANDOIMPERIO CÍMÛ MUNKÁJÁBAN - Takács Zoltán Bálint, SAVARIAA VAS MEGYEI MÚZEUMOK ÉRTESÍTÕJE28 SZOMBATHELY, 2004, pp. 317–333  The reliability of the Byzantine emperor's report of Árpád's election is debated by modern historians: for instance, Victor Spinei states that it is "rather vague and scarcely credible", but András Róna-Tas writes that its core is reliable. The latter historian adds that Árpád's election was promoted by Álmos, who forced Levedi to renounce his position as "kende". Accordingly, in Róna-Tas's view, Árpád succeeded Levedi as sacred ruler, or "kende", which enabled his father to preserve his own position as the actual leader of the Hungarians, or "gyula".   The earliest reliable source of Árpád's life is an early 10th-century document, the "George Hamartolos#Chronicle|Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk". It narrates that the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r.&nbsp;886–912) sent his envoy Nicetas Sclerus to the Hungarians in 894 or 895 "to give presents" and incite them against the First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire. Sclerus met with their two leaders, Árpád and Kurszán, at the Lower Danube. Sclerus's mission succeeded: a Hungarian army soon crossed the Danube on Byzantine ships against Bulgaria. An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus's text suggests that the invading Hungarians were under the command of Árpád's son, Liüntika. The positions held by Árpád and Kurszán at the time of their negotiations with Sclerus are debated by historians. Spinei wrote that Árpád was the "gyula", and Kurszán was the "kende". In contrast, Kristó said that Kurszán was the "gyula" and Árpád represented his father, Álmos "kende".  File:Árpád fejedelem 2 - Székelybere.jpg|190px|thumb|left|alt=Árpád's statue in Bereni (Székelybere, Romania)|Árpád's statue in Székelybere (Bereni, Romania)  The Hungarian army defeated the Bulgarians, but the latter hired the Pechenegs against them. The Bulgarians and Pechenegs simultaneously invaded the Hungarians' territories in the western regions of the Pontic steppes in 895 or 896. The destruction of their dwelling places by the Pechenegs forced the Hungarians to leave for a new homeland across the Carpathian Mountains towards the Pannonian Plain. The "Illuminated Chronicle" says that Árpád's father Álmos "could not enter Pannonia, for he was killed in Erdelw" or Transylvania."The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle" (ch. 28), p. 98. Engel, Kristó and Molnár, who accept the reliability of this report, wrote that Álmos's death was a ritual murder, similar to the sacrifice of the Khazar khagans in case of a disaster affecting their people. In contrast with them, Róna-Tas states that even if the report on Álmos's murder "reflects true event, the only possible explanation would be that Árpád or someone in his entourage" killed the aged prince. Spinei rejects the "Illuminated Chronicle"s report on Álmos's murder in Transylvania, because the last mention of Álmos in the contrasting narration of the "Gesta Hungarorum" is connected to a siege of Ungvár (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) by the Hungarians. The latter chronicle says that Álmos appointed Árpád "as leader and master" of the Hungarians on this occasion."Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians" (ch. 13), p. 37.  File:Aquincum-Óbuda-01.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt="The city of King Attila" (Aquincum, Budapest)|Ruins of Aquincum"city of Attila the Hun|King Attila" in the "Gesta Hungarorum""Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians", note 1 on p. 8. Árpád's name "is completely unknown" to all sources written in East Francia, which was one of the main powers of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th&nbsp;centuries. These sources, including the "Annales Alamannici" and the "Annales Eisnidlenses", only mention another Hungarian leader, Kurszán. According to Kristó and other historians, these sources suggest that Kurszán must have been the "gyula" commanding the Hungarian forces, while Árpád succeeded his murdered father as the sacred "kende". Proposing a contrasting theory, the Romanian historian Curta wrote that Kurszán was the "kende" and Árpád "gyula" only succeeded him when Kurszán was murdered by Bavarians in 902 or 904. In contrast to nearly contemporaneous sources, Hungarian chronicles written centuries after the eventsfor instance, the "Gesta Hungarorum" and the "Illuminated Chronicle"emphasize Árpád's pre-eminent role in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin. The "Gesta Hungarorum" also highlights Árpád's military skills and his generosity. This chronicle also emphasizes that Tétény, one of the heads of the seven Hungarian tribes, acquired "the land of Transylvania for himself and his posterity" only after Árpád had authorized him to conquer it."Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians" (ch. 24), p. 59. {{Quote|"Having crossed the Danube, they encamped beside the Danube as far as Budafelhévíz.
