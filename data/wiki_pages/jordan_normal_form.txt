 File:Jordan canonical form.svg|thumb|360px|Example of a matrix in Jordan normal form. All matrix entries not shown are zero. The outlined squares are known as "Jordan blocks". Each Jordan block contains one number lambda on its main diagonal, and ones above the main diagonal. The lambdas are the eigenvalues of the matrix; they need not be distinct. In linear algebra, a "Jordan normal form", also known as a "Jordan canonical form" ("JCF"), Shilov defines the term "Jordan canonical form" and in a footnote says that "Jordan normal form" is synonymous. These terms are sometimes shortened to "Jordan form". (Shilov) The term "Classical canonical form" is also sometimes used in the sense of this article. (James & James, 1976)  is an upper triangular matrix of a particular form called a Jordan matrix representing a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space with respect to some Basis (linear algebra)|basis. Such a matrix has each non-zero off-diagonal entry equal to&nbsp;1, immediately above the main diagonal (on the superdiagonal), and with identical diagonal entries to the left and below them. Let "V" be a vector space over a field (mathematics)|field "K". Then a basis with respect to which the matrix has the required form exists if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix lie in "K", or equivalently if the characteristic polynomial of the operator splits into linear factors over "K". This condition is always satisfied if "K" is algebraically closed (for instance, if it is the field of complex numbers). The diagonal entries of the normal form are the eigenvalues (of the operator), and the number of times each eigenvalue occurs is called the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue. If the operator is originally given by a square matrix "M", then its Jordan normal form is also called the Jordan normal form of "M". Any square matrix has a Jordan normal form if the field of coefficients is extended to one containing all the eigenvalues of the matrix. In spite of its name, the normal form for a given "M" is not entirely unique, as it is a block diagonal matrix formed of Jordan blocks, the order of which is not fixed; it is conventional to group blocks for the same eigenvalue together, but no ordering is imposed among the eigenvalues, nor among the blocks for a given eigenvalue, although the latter could for instance be ordered by weakly decreasing size. The Jordan–Chevalley decomposition is particularly simple with respect to a basis for which the operator takes its Jordan normal form. The diagonal form for diagonalizable matrices, for instance normal matrix|normal matrices, is a special case of the Jordan normal form. The Jordan normal form is named after Camille Jordan, who first stated the Jordan decomposition theorem in 1870.Brechenmacher, , Thesis, 2007 == Overview ==  Some textbooks have the ones on the subdiagonal; that is, immediately below the main diagonal instead of on the superdiagonal. The eigenvalues are still on the main diagonal.  An "n" × "n" matrix "A" is diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is "n". Or, equivalently, if and only if "A" has "n" linearly independent eigenvectors. Not all matrices are diagonalizable; matrices that are not diagonalizable are called defective matrix|defective matrices. Consider the following matrix: : <math>A =   \left      0 &  1 & -1 & -1 \\     -1 & -1 &  3 &  0 \\      1 &  1 & -1 &  2   \end{array}\right]. </math> Including multiplicity, the eigenvalues of "A" are "λ" = 1, 2, 4, 4. The Hamel dimension|dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is 1 (and not 2), so "A" is not diagonalizable. However, there is an invertible matrix "P" such that "J" = "P"<sup>−1</sup>"AP", where :<math>J = \begin{bmatrix}   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\   0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}.</math> The matrix <math>J</math> is almost diagonal. This is the Jordan normal form of "A". The section #Example|"Example" below fills in the details of the computation. == Complex matrices == In general, a square complex matrix "A" is similar (linear algebra)|similar to a block diagonal matrix :<math>J = \begin{bmatrix} J_1 & \;     & \; \\ \;  & \ddots & \; \\  \;  & \;     & J_p\end{bmatrix}</math> where each block "J<sub>i</sub>" is a square matrix of the form :<math>J_i =  \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_i & 1            & \;     & \;  \\ \;        & \lambda_i    & \ddots & \;  \\ \;        & \;           & \ddots & 1   \\ \;        & \;           & \;     & \lambda_i        \end{bmatrix}.</math> So there exists an invertible matrix "P" such that "P"<sup>−1</sup>"AP" = "J" is such that the only non-zero entries of "J" are on the diagonal and the superdiagonal. "J" is called the "Jordan normal form" of "A". Each "J"<sub>"i"</sub> is called a Jordan block of "A". In a given Jordan block, every entry on the superdiagonal is 1. Assuming this result, we can deduce the following properties: * Counting multiplicities, the eigenvalues of "J", and therefore of "A", are the diagonal entries. * Given an eigenvalue "λ"<sub>"i"</sub>, its "geometric multiplicity" is the dimension of ker("A" &minus; "λ"<sub>"i" </sub>"I"), where "I" is the identity matrix, and it is the number of Jordan blocks corresponding to "λ"<sub>"i"</sub>. * The sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks corresponding to an eigenvalue "λ"<sub>"i"</sub> is its "algebraic multiplicity". * "A" is diagonalizable if and only if, for every eigenvalue "λ" of "A", its geometric and algebraic multiplicities coincide. In particular, the Jordan blocks in this case are 1&nbsp;×&nbsp;1 matrices; that is, scalars. * The Jordan block corresponding to "λ" is of the form "λI"&nbsp;+&nbsp;"N", where "N" is a nilpotent matrix defined as "N"<sub>"ij"</sub> = "δ<sub>i</sub>"<sub>,"j"&minus;1</sub> (where δ is the Kronecker delta). The nilpotency of "N" can be exploited when calculating "f"("A") where "f" is a complex analytic function. For example, in principle the Jordan form could give a closed-form expression for the exponential exp("A"). * The number of Jordan blocks corresponding to "λ" of size at least "j" is dim&nbsp;ker("A"&nbsp;−&nbsp;"λI")<sup>"j"</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;dim&nbsp;ker("A"&nbsp;−&nbsp;"λI")<sup>"j"</sup><sup>−1</sup>. Thus, the number of Jordan blocks of size "j" is *:<math>2 \dim \ker (A - \lambda_i I)^j - \dim \ker (A - \lambda_i I)^{j+1} - \dim \ker (A - \lambda_i I)^{j-1}</math> * Given an eigenvalue "λ"<sub>"i"</sub>, its multiplicity in the minimal polynomial is the size of its largest Jordan block.  Consider the matrix <math>A</math> from the example in the previous section. The Jordan normal form is obtained by some similarity transformation: :<math>P^{-1}AP = J;</math> that is, <math>AP = PJ.</math> Let <math>P</math> have column vectors <math>p_i</math>, <math>i = 1, \ldots, 4</math>, then : <math>A \begin{bmatrix} p_1 & p_2 & p_3 & p_4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 & p_2 & p_3 & p_4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 & 2p_2 & 4p_3 & p_3+4p_4 \end{bmatrix}.</math> We see that :<math> (A - 1 I) p_1 = 0 </math> :<math> (A - 2 I) p_2 = 0 </math> :<math> (A - 4 I) p_3 = 0 </math> :<math> (A - 4 I) p_4 = p_3. </math> For <math>i = 1,2,3</math> we have <math>p_i \in \ker(A-\lambda_{i} I)</math>, that is, <math>p_i</math> is an eigenvector of <math>A</math> corresponding to the eigenvalue <math>\lambda_i</math>. For <math>i=4</math>, multiplying both sides by <math>(A-4I)</math> gives :<math> (A-4I)^2 p_4 = (A-4I) p_3. </math> But <math>(A-4I)p_3 = 0</math>, so :<math> (A-4I)^2 p_4 = 0. </math> Thus, <math>p_4 \in \ker(A-4 I)^2.</math> Vectors such as <math>p_4</math> are called generalized eigenvectors of "A".  This example shows how to calculate the Jordan normal form of a given matrix. Consider the matrix :<math>A = \left </math> which is mentioned in the beginning of the article. The characteristic polynomial of "A" is :<math> \begin{align} \chi(\lambda) & = \det(\lambda I - A) \\ &  = \lambda^4 - 11 \lambda^3 + 42 \lambda^2 - 64 \lambda + 32  \\ & = (\lambda-1)(\lambda-2)(\lambda-4)^2. \, \end{align} </math> This shows that the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 4 and 4, according to algebraic multiplicity. The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 can be found by solving the equation "Av" = "λv". It is spanned by the column vector "v" = (−1, 1, 0, 0)<sup>T</sup>. Similarly, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 2 is spanned by "w" = (1, −1, 0, 1)<sup>T</sup>. Finally, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is also one-dimensional (even though this is a double eigenvalue) and is spanned by "x" = (1, 0, −1, 1)<sup>T</sup>. So, the geometric multiplicity (that is, the dimension of the eigenspace of the given eigenvalue) of each of the three eigenvalues is one. Therefore, the two eigenvalues equal to 4 correspond to a single Jordan block, and the Jordan normal form of the matrix "A" is the Matrix addition#Direct sum|direct sum :<math> J = J_1(1) \oplus J_1(2) \oplus J_2(4) =  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}. </math> There are three Generalized eigenvector#Jordan chains|Jordan chains. Two have length one: {"v"} and {"w"}, corresponding to the eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively. There is one chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4. To find this chain, calculate : <math>\ker(A-4I)^2 = \operatorname{span} \, \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \left \right\}</math> where "I" is the 4 × 4 identity matrix. Pick a vector in the above span that is not in the kernel of "A"&nbsp;−&nbsp;4"I"; for example, "y" = (1,0,0,0)<sup>T</sup>. Now, ("A"&nbsp;−&nbsp;4"I")"y" = "x" and ("A"&nbsp;−&nbsp;4"I")"x" = 0, so {"y", "x"} is a chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4. The transition matrix "P" such that "P"<sup>−1</sup>"AP" = "J" is formed by putting these vectors next to each other as follows :<math> P = \left =  \left. </math> A computation shows that the equation "P"<sup>−1</sup>"AP" = "J" indeed holds. :<math>P^{-1}AP=J=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}.</math> If we had interchanged the order in which the chain vectors appeared, that is, changing the order of "v", "w" and {"x", "y"} together, the Jordan blocks would be interchanged. However, the Jordan forms are equivalent Jordan forms. == Generalized eigenvectors ==  Given an eigenvalue "λ", every corresponding Jordan block gives rise to a "Jordan chain" of linearly independent vectors "p<sub>i</sub>, i = "1", ..., b", where "b" is the size of the Jordan block. The "generator", or "lead vector", "p<sub>b</sub>" of the chain is a generalized eigenvector such that ("A" − "λ""I")<sup>"b"</sup>"p"<sub>"b"</sub> = 0. The vector "p"<sub>1</sub> =  ("A" − "λ""I")<sup>"b"−1</sup>"p"<sub>"b"</sub> is an ordinary eigenvector corresponding to "λ". In general, "p"<sub>"i"</sub> is a preimage of "p"<sub>"i"−1</sub> under "A" − "λ""I". So the lead vector generates the chain via multiplication by "A" − "λ""I". Therefore the statement that every square matrix "A" can be put in Jordan normal form is equivalent to the claim that the underlying vector space has a basis composed of Jordan chains.  We give a proof by induction that any complex-valued square matrix "A" may be put in Jordan normal form. Since the underlying vector space can be shownRoe Goodman and Nolan R. Wallach, "Representations and Invariants of Classical Groups", Cambridge UP 1998, Appendix B.1. to be the direct sum of invariant subspaces associated with the eigenvalues, "A" can be assumed to have just one eigenvalue "λ". The 1 &times; 1 case is trivial. Let "A" be an "n" &times; "n" matrix. The range of a function|range of "A" − "λ""I", denoted by Ran("A" − "λ""I"), is an invariant subspace of "A". Also, since "λ" is an eigenvalue of "A", the dimension of Ran("A" − "λ""I"), "r", is strictly less than "n", so, by the inductive hypothesis, Ran("A" − "λ""I") has a basis (linear algebra)|basis {"p"<sub>1</sub>, …, "p"<sub>"r"</sub>} composed of Jordan chains.   Next consider the kernel (linear algebra)|kernel, that is, t ...
