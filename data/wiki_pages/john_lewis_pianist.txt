She died from peritonitis when he was four and he was raised by his grandmother and great-grandmother. He began learning classical music and piano at the age of seven. His family was musical and had a family band that allowed him to play frequently and he also played in a Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout music group.#Lyons|Lyons, p. 77. Even though he learned piano by playing the classics, he was exposed to jazz from an early age because his aunt loved to dance and he would listen to the music she played. He attended the University of New Mexico, where he led a small dance band that he formed#Giddins|Giddins, p. 378. and double majored in Anthropology and Music. His piano teacher at the university was Walter Keller, to whom he paid tribute on the title composition of the Modern Jazz Quartet's 1974 album "In Memoriam (Modern Jazz Quartet album)|In Memoriam".#Giddins|Giddins, p. 398. Eventually, he decided not to pursue Anthropology because he was advised that careers from degrees in the subject did not pay well. In 1942, Lewis entered the Army and played piano alongside Kenny Clarke, who influenced him to move to New York once their service was over.#Lyons|Lyons, p. 76. Lewis moved to New York in 1945 to pursue his musical studies at the Manhattan School of Music and eventually graduated with a master's degree in music in 1953. Although his move to New York turned his musical attention more towards jazz, he still frequently played and listened to classical works and composers such as Chopin, Bach and Beethoven. ==Jazz career== File:John Lewis (William P Gottlieb).jpg|left|thumb|Lewis (1946–1948) Once Lewis moved to New York, Clarke introduced him to Dizzy Gillespie's bop-style big band. He successfully auditioned by playing a song called "Bright Lights" that he had written for the band he and Clarke played for in the Army. The tune he originally played for Gillespie, renamed "Two Bass Hit", became an instant success.#Giddins|Giddins, p. 379. Lewis composed, arranged and played piano for the band from 1946 until 1948 after the band made a concert tour of Europe. When Lewis returned from the tour with Gillespie's band, he left it to work individually. Lewis was an accompanist for Charlie Parker and played on some of Parker's famous recordings, such as "Parker's Mood" (1948) and "Blues for Alice" (1951), but also collaborated with other prominent jazz artists such as Lester Young, Ella Fitzgerald and Illinois Jacquet. Lewis was also part of trumpeter Miles Davis's "Birth of the Cool" sessions. While in Europe, Lewis received letters from Davis urging him to come back to the United States and collaborate with him, Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan and others on the second session of "Birth of the Cool".#Lyons|Lyons, p. 78. From when he returned to the U.S. in 1948 through 1949, Lewis joined Davis's nonet and is considered "one of the more prolific arrangers with the 1949&nbsp;Miles Davis Nonet".#Davis|Davis, p. 228. For the "Birth of the Cool" sessions, Lewis arranged "S'il Vous Plait", "Rouge", "Move" and "Budo". Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, drummer Clarke and bassist Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown had been the small group within the Gillespie big band,This practice of having small groups within the big band began in 1935 when Benny Goodman had a trio in his band that would play when the arrangers and other musicians in his band needed a break. Since that time, it became common for big bands to have smaller groups within (#Giddins|Giddins, p. 378). and they frequently played their own short sets when the brass and reeds needed a break or even when Gillespie's band was not playing.#Lyons|Lyons, p. 79. The small band received a lot of positive recognition and it led to the foursome forming a full-time working group, which they initially called the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951 but in 1952 renamed the Modern Jazz Quartet.  The Modern Jazz Quartet was formed out of the foursome's need for more freedom and complexity than Gillespie's big band, dance-intended sound allowed.#Giddins|Giddins, p. 380. While Lewis wanted the MJQ to have more improvisational freedom, he also wanted to incorporate some classical elements and arrangements into his compositions. Lewis noticed that the style of bebop had turned all focus towards the soloist, and Lewis, in his compositions for the MJQ, attempted to even out the periods of improvisation with periods that were distinctly arranged.#Davis|Davis, p. 229. Lewis assumed the role of musical director from the start, even though the group claimed not to have a leader.#Giddins|Giddins, p. 383. It is commonly thought that "John Lewis, for reasons of his contributions to the band, was apparently the first among the equals". Davis even once said that "John taught all of them, Milt couldn't read at all, and bassist Percy Heath hardly". It was Lewis who elevated the group's collective talent because of his individual musical abilities. Lewis gradually transformed the group away from strictly 1940s bebop style, which served as a vehicle for an individual artist's improvisations, and instead oriented it toward a more refined, polished, chamber style of music.#Giddins|Giddins, pp. 379–381. Lewis's compositions for The Modern Jazz Quartet developed a "neoclassical style" of jazz that combined the bebop style with "dynamic shading and dramatic pause more characteristic of jazz of the '20s and '30s". Francis Davis, in his book "In the Moment: Jazz in the 1980s", wrote that by "fashioning a group music in which the improvised chorus and all that surrounded it were of equal importance, Lewis performed a feat of magic only a handful of jazz writers, including Duke Ellington and Jelly Roll Morton, had ever pulled off—he reconciled the composer's belief in predetermination with the improviser's yen for free will". Lewis also made sure that the band was always dressed impeccably.#Giddins|Giddins, p. 382. Lewis believed that it was important to dress the way that they came across in their music: polished, elegant and unique. Lewis once said in an interview with "Down Beat" magazine: "My model for that was Duke Ellington.  was the most elegant band I ever saw". From 1952 through 1974, he wrote and performed with and for the quartet. Lewis's compositions were paramount in earning the MJQ a worldwide reputation for managing to make jazz mannered without cutting the swing out of the music.#Giddins|Giddins, p. 387. Gunther Schuller for "High Fidelity Magazine" wrote: <blockquote>It will not come as a surprise that the Quartet's growth has followed a line parallel to Lewis' own development as a composer. A study of his compositions from the early "Afternoon in Paris" to such recent pieces as "La Cantatrice" and "Piazza Navona" shows an increasing technical mastery and stylistic broadening. The wonder of his music is that the various influences upon his work—whether they be the fugal masterpieces of Bach, the folk-tinged music of Bartók, the clearly defined textures of Stravinsky's "Agon", or the deeply felt blues atmosphere that permeates all his music—these have all become synthesized into a thoroughly homogeneous personal idiom. That is why Lewis' music, though not radical in any sense, always sounds fresh and individual.Schuller, p. 56.</blockquote> During the same time period, Lewis held various other positions as well, including head of faculty for the summer sessions held at the Lenox School of Jazz in Lenox, Massachusetts from 1957 to 1960, director of the annual Monterey Jazz Festival in California from 1958 to 1983, and its musical consultant,Schuller, p. 135. and "he formed the cooperative big band Orchestra U.S.A., which performed and recorded Third stream|Third Stream compositions (1962–65)". Orchestra U.S.A., along with all of Lewis's compositions in general, were very influential in developing "Third Stream" music, which was largely defined by the interweave between classical and jazz traditions. He also formed the Jazz and Classical Music Society in 1955, which hosted concerts in Town Hall in New York City that assisted in this new genre of classically influenced jazz to increase in popularity.Schuller, p. 134. Furthermore, Lewis was also commissioned to compose the score to the 1957 film "No Sun in Venice|Sait-On Jamais",Schuller, p. 195. and his later film work included the scores to "Odds Against Tomorrow" (1959), "Una storia milanese|A Milanese Story" (1962), Derek Jarman's version of "The Tempest (1979 film)|The Tempest" (1979), and the TV movie "Emmanuelle 4: Concealed Fantasy" (1994). His score to "Odds Against Tomorrow" was released on both an original soundtrack album (UA 5061) and an Music from Odds Against Tomorrow|interpretation album by the MJQ in 1959. The MJQ disbanded in 1974 because Jackson felt that the band was not getting enough money for the level of prestige the quartet had in the music scene.#Lyons|Lyons, pp. 81–82. During this break, Lewis taught at the City College of New York and at Harvard University. Lewis was also able to travel to Japan, where CBS commissioned his first solo piano album.#Lyons|Lyons, p. 80. While in Japan, Lewis also collaborated with Hank Jones and Marian McPartland,He met Marian McPartland while teaching at Harvard (#Lyons|Lyons, p. 80). with whom he performed piano recitals on various occasions. In 1981, the Modern Jazz Quartet re-formed for a tour of Japan and the United States, although the group did not plan on performing regularly together again. Since the MJQ was no longer his primary career, Lewis had time to form and play in a sextet called the John Lewis Group. A few years later, in 1985, Lewis collaborated with Gary Giddins and Roberta Swann to form the American Jazz Orchestra. Additionally, he continued to teach jazz piano to aspiring jazz students, which he had done throughout his career. His teaching style involved making sure the student was fluent in "three basic forms: the blues, a ballad, and a piece that moves". He continued teaching late into his life. In 1989, Lewis was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music. He was recognized for his impact on jazz and his amazing career. In the 1990s, Lewis partook of various musical ventures, including participating in the "Re-birth of the Cool" sessions with Gerry Mulligan in 1992, and "The Birth of the Third Stream" with Gunther Schuller, Charles Mingus and George Russell (composer)|George Russell, and recorded his final albums with Atlantic Records, "Evolution" and "Evolution II", in 1999 and 2000 respectively. He also continued playing sporadically with the MJQ until 1997, when the group permanently disbanded. Lewis performed a final concert at Lincoln Center in New York and played a repertoire that represented his full musical ability—from solo piano to big-band and everything in between. He died in New York City on March 29, 2001, at the age of 80, after a long battle with prostate cancer. He was survived by his wife of 39 years, harpsichordist Mirjana (née Vrbanić; 1936–2010), a son and daughter, and three grandchildren.{{cite news| ...
