Beatrice was also the last of Queen Victoria's children to die, nearly 66 years after the first, her elder sister Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice. Beatrice's childhood coincided with Queen Victoria's grief following the death of her husband on 14 December 1861. As her elder sisters married and left their mother, the Queen came to rely on the company of her youngest daughter, whom she called "Baby" for most of her childhood. Beatrice was brought up to stay with her mother always and she soon resigned herself to her fate. The Queen was so set against her youngest daughter marrying that she refused to discuss the possibility. Nevertheless, many suitors were put forward, including Louis Napoléon, Prince Imperial, the son of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France, and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, the widower of Beatrice's older sister Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice. She was attracted to the Prince Imperial and there was talk of a possible marriage, but he was killed in the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and brother-in-law of her niece Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, the Queen, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War|Anglo-Asante War. Beatrice remained at her mother's side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated literary executor and continued to make public appearances. She died aged 87 in 1944. ==Early life== Image:QVPB.jpg|left|thumb|Queen Victoria holding Princess Beatrice in 1862 Princess Beatrice was born on 14 April 1857 at Buckingham Palace, London.Dennison, p. 2 She was the fifth daughter and youngest of the nine children of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later the Prince Consort). The birth caused controversy when it was announced that Queen Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of chloroform administered by John Snow (physician)|Dr John Snow. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the Church of England and the medical authorities.Dennison, p. 3 Queen Victoria was undeterred and used "that blessed chloroform" for her last pregnancy.Longford, ("Victoria R. I."), p. 234 A fortnight later, Queen Victoria reported in her journal, "I was amply rewarded and forgot all I had gone through when I heard dearest Albert say 'It's a fine child, and a girl!'"Quoted in Dennison, p. 3 Albert and Queen Victoria chose the names "Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore": Mary after Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester, the last surviving child of George III|King George III of the United Kingdom; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after Princess Feodora of Leiningen|Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Queen's older half-sister. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were the Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent (maternal grandmother); the Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Royal (eldest sister); and the Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick of Prussia (her future brother-in-law).Dennison, p. 8 File:The royal children in mourning Mar 1862.jpg|right|thumb|The daughters of Queen Victoria mourn the loss of their father. Beatrice is standing in the centre. From birth, Beatrice became a favoured child.Dennison, p. 13 The elder favourite daughter of Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, was about to take up residence in Germany with her new husband, Frederick ("Fritz") of Prussia. At the same time, the newly arrived Beatrice showed promise. Albert wrote to Augusta of Saxe-Weimar|Augusta, Fritz's mother, that "Baby practises her scales like a good "prima donna" before a performance and has a good voice!"Jagow, p. 272 Although Queen Victoria was known to dislike most babies, she liked Beatrice, whom she considered attractive. This provided Beatrice with an advantage over her elder siblings. Queen Victoria once remarked that Beatrice was "a pretty, plump and flourishing child&nbsp;... with fine large blue eyes,  pretty little mouth and very fine skin".Quoted in Dennison, p. 11 Her long, golden hair was the focus of paintings commissioned by Queen Victoria, who enjoyed giving Beatrice her bath, in marked contrast to her bathing preferences for her other children. Beatrice showed intelligence, which further endeared her to the Prince Consort, who was amused by her childhood precociousness. He wrote to Baron Stockmar that Beatrice was "the most amusing baby we have had." Despite sharing the rigorous education programme designed by Prince Albert and his close adviser, Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar, Beatrice had a more relaxed infancy than her siblings because of her relationship with her parents.Dennison, p. 22 By four years of age, the youngest, and the acknowledged last royal child, Beatrice was not forced to share her parents' attention the way her siblings had, and her amusing ways provided comfort to her faltering father. ==Queen Victoria's devoted companion== File:Princess Beatrice 1868.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Princess Beatrice in 1868 In March 1861, Queen Victoria's mother Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Victoria, Duchess of Kent, died at Frogmore. The Queen broke down in grief and guilt over their estrangement at the beginning of her reign.Longford, ("Victoria, Duchess of Kent") Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Beatrice tried to console her mother by reminding her that the Duchess of Kent was "in heaven, but Beatrice hopes she will return".Quoted in Epton, p. 92 This comfort was significant because Queen Victoria had isolated herself from her children except the eldest unmarried daughter, Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice, and Beatrice.Bolitho, p. 104 Queen Victoria again relied on Beatrice and Alice after the death of Albert, of typhoid fever, on 14 December.Bolitho, pp. 195–196 The depth of the Queen's grief over the death of her husband surprised her family, courtiers, politicians and general populace. As when her mother died, she shut herself off from her family—most particularly, the Edward VII|Prince of Wales, (whom she blamed for her husband's death),Matthew, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Queen Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried to her bed and "lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more."Duff, p. 10 After 1871, when the last of Beatrice's elder sisters married,Victoria, Princess Royal in 1858; Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice in 1862; Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Helena in 1866; Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Louise in 1871 Queen Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: "I don't like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother."Quoted in Dennison, p. 38 As her mother's secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen's behalf and helping with political correspondence.Dennison, p. 204 These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise.Dennison, p. 92 However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice, and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier. The devotion that Beatrice showed to her mother was acknowledged in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger.Bolitho, p. 301After a failed assassination attempt on the Queen in 1882, she wrote of Beatrice: "Nothing can exceed dearest Beatrice's courage and calmness, for she saw the whole thing, the man take aim, and fire straight into the carriage, but she never said a word, observing that I was not frightened." The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown (servant)|John Brown, died at Balmoral Castle|Balmoral.Buckle, p. 418 Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, they had worked together to carry out the Queen's wishes.Dennison, pp. 95–101 ==Marriage==  Although the Queen was set against Beatrice marrying anyone in the expectation that she would always stay at home with her, a number of possible suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon, Prince Imperial|Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870.Corley, p. 349 After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial.Dennison, pp. 86–87 These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria's journal records their grief: "Dear Beatrice, crying very much as I did too, gave me the telegram&nbsp;... It was dawning and little sleep did I get&nbsp;... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned."Quoted in Dennison, p. 89 File:Napoléon Eugène Bonaparte, sitting.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Louis Napoléon, Prince Imperial, to whom Beatrice was romantically attached in the 1870s After the death of the Prince Imperial, the Prince of Wales suggested that Beatrice marry their sister Alice's widower, Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse.  Alice had died in 1878, and the Prince argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease.Dennison, pp. 103–106 However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the British House of Commons|House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was disappointed that the bill had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side. Other candidates, including two of Prince Henry's brothers, Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander ("Sandro") and Prince Louis of Battenberg, were put forward to be Beatrice's husband, but they did not succeed.  Although Alexander never formally pursued Beatrice, merely claiming that he "might even at one time have become engaged to the friend of my childhood, Beatrice of England",Quoted in Dennison, p. 126 Louis was more interested. Queen Victoria invited him to dinner but sat between him and Beatrice, who had been told by the Queen to ignore Louis to discourage his suit.Dennison, p. 116 Louis, not realising for several years the reasons for this silence, married Beatrice's niece, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Although her marriage hopes had been dealt another blow, while attending Louis's wedding at Darmstadt, Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry, who returned her affections.Dennison, p. 124   F ...
