The release of 3D Studio made Autodesk's previous 3D rendering package AutoShade obsolete. After 3D Studio DOS Release 4, the product was rewritten for the Windows NT platform, and renamed "3D Studio MAX". This version was also originally created by the Yost Group. It was released by Kinetix, which was at that time Autodesk's division of media and entertainment. Autodesk purchased the product at the second release update of the 3D Studio MAX version and internalized development entirely over the next two releases. Later, the product name was changed to "3ds max" (all lower case) to better comply with the naming conventions of Discreet, a Montreal-based software company which Autodesk had purchased. When it was re-released (release 7), the product was again branded with the Autodesk logo, and the short name was again changed to "3ds Max" (upper and lower case), while the formal product name became the current "Autodesk 3ds Max".  {| class="wikitable" ! scope="col" | Version ! scope="col" | Codename ! scope="col" | Year ! scope="col" | Operating system ! scope="col" | Hardware platform |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio Prototype | THUD | 1988 | rowspan="5" |MS-DOS | rowspan="5" | 16-bit x86 originally<br/>32-bit x86 using DOS extender |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio | THUD | 1990 |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio 2 | | 1992 |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio 3 | | 1993 |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio 4 | | 1994 |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio MAX 1.0 | Jaguar | 1996 |Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0 | rowspan="8" |IA-32 |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio MAX R2 | Athena | 1997 | rowspan="2" |Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 |- ! scope="row" | 3D Studio MAX R3 | Shiva | 1999 |- ! scope="row" | Discreet 3dsmax 4 | Magma | 2000 |Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 |- ! scope="row" | Discreet 3dsmax 5 | Luna | 2002 | rowspan="5" | Windows 98 (only 3dsmax 5) Windows 2000 and Windows XP |- ! scope="row" | Discreet 3dsmax 6 | Granite | 2003 |- ! scope="row" | Discreet 3dsmax 7 | Catalyst | 2004 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 8 | Vesper | 2005 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 9 | Makalu | 2006 | rowspan="7" |IA-32 and x64 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2008 | Gouda | 2007 | rowspan="3" |Windows XP and Windows Vista |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2009 | Johnson | 2008 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2010 | Renoir | 2009 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 | Zelda | 2010 | rowspan="2" |Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2012 | Excalibur / Rampage  | 2011 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2013 | SimCity | 2012 |Windows XP and Windows 7 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2014 | Tekken | 2013 |Windows 7 | rowspan="10" |x64 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2015 | Elwood | 2014 |Windows 7 and Windows 8 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2016 | Phoenix | 2015 |Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2017 | Kirin | 2016 | rowspan="4" |Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 |- ! scope="row" | Autodesk 3ds Max 2018 | Imoogi | 2017 |- !Autodesk 3ds Max 2019 |Neptune |2018 |- !

Plugin modules can be created entirely within MAXScript. ; Character Studio : Character Studio was a plugin which since version 4 of Max is now integrated in 3ds Max; it helps users to animate virtual characters. The system works using a character rig or "Biped" skeleton which has stock settings that can be modified and customized to fit the character meshes and animation needs. This tool also includes robust editing tools for IK/FK switching, Pose manipulation, Layers and Keyframing workflows, and sharing of animation data across different Biped skeletons. These "Biped" objects have other useful features that help accelerate the production of Walk Cycle|walk cycles and movement paths, as well as secondary motion. ; Scene Explorer : Scene Explorer, a tool that provides a hierarchical view of scene data and analysis, facilitates working with more complex scenes. Scene Explorer has the ability to sort, filter, and search a scene by any object type or property (including metadata). Added in 3ds Max 2008, it was the first component to facilitate .NET managed code in 3ds Max outside of MAXScript. ; DWG import : 3ds Max supports both import and linking of DWG|.dwg files. Improved memory management in 3ds Max 2008 enables larger scenes to be imported with multiple objects. ; Texture assignment/editing : 3ds Max offers operations for creative texture and planar mapping, including tiling, mirroring, decals, angle, rotate, blur, UV stretching, and relaxation; Remove Distortion; Preserve UV; and UV template image export. The texture workflow includes the ability to combine an unlimited number of textures, a material/map browser with support for drag-and-drop assignment, and hierarchies with thumbnails. UV workflow features include Pelt mapping, which defines custom seams and enables users to unfold UVs according to those seams; copy/paste materials, maps and colors; and access to quick mapping types (box, cylindrical, spherical). ; General keyframing : Two keying modes — set key and auto key — offer support for different keyframing workflows. : Fast and intuitive controls for keyframing — including cut, copy, and paste — let the user create animations with ease. Animation trajectories may be viewed and edited directly in the viewport. ; Constrained animation : Objects can be animated along curves with controls for alignment, banking, velocity, smoothness, and looping, and along surfaces with controls for alignment. Weight path-controlled animation between multiple curves, and animate the weight. Objects can be constrained to animate with other objects in many ways — including look at, orientation in different coordinate spaces, and linking at different points in time. These constraints also support animated weighting between more than one target. : All resulting constrained animation can be collapsed into standard keyframes for further editing. ; Skinning : Either the Skin or Physique modifier may be used to achieve precise control of Skeletal animation|skeletal deformation, so the character deforms smoothly as joints are moved, even in the most challenging areas, such as shoulders. Skin deformation can be controlled using direct weight map|vertex weights, volumes of vertices defined by envelopes, or both. Capabilities such as weight tables, Vertex painting|paintable weights, and saving and loading of weights offer easy editing and proximity-based transfer between models, providing the accuracy and flexibility needed for complicated characters. : The rigid bind skinning option is useful for animating low-polygon models or as a diagnostic tool for regular skeleton animation. : Additional modifiers, such as Skin Wrap and Skin Morph, can be used to drive meshes with other meshes and make targeted weighting adjustments in tricky areas. ; Skeletons and inverse kinematics (IK) : Characters can be rigged with custom skeletons using 3ds Max bones, IK solvers, and rigging tools powered by Motion Capture Data. : All animation tools — including expressions, scripts, list controllers, and wiring — can be used along with a set of utilities specific to bones to build rigs of any structure and with custom controls, so animators see only the UI necessary to get their characters animated. Four plug-in IK solvers ship with 3ds Max: history-independent solver, history-dependent solver, limb solver, and spline IK solver. These powerful solvers reduce the time it takes to create high-quality character animation. The history-independent solver delivers smooth blending between IK and FK animation and uses preferred angles to give animators more control over the positioning of affected bones.  The history-dependent solver can solve within joint limits and is used for machine-like animation. IK limb is a lightweight two-bone solver, optimized for real-time interactivity, ideal for working with a character arm or leg. Spline IK solver provides a flexible animation system with nodes that can be moved anywhere in 3D space. It allows for efficient animation of skeletal chains, such as a character's spine or tail, and includes easy-to-use twist and roll controls. ; Integrated Cloth solver : In addition to reactor's cloth modifier, 3ds Max software has an integrated cloth-simulation engine that enables the user to turn almost any 3D object into clothing and even build garments from scratch. Collision solving is fast and accurate even in complex simulations. Local simulation lets artists drape cloth in real time to set up an initial clothing state before setting animation keys. : Cloth simulations can be used in conjunction with other 3ds Max dynamic forces, such as Space Warps. Multiple independent cloth systems can be animated with their own objects and forces. Cloth deformation data can be cached to the hard drive to allow for nondestructive iterations and to improve playback performance. ; Integration with Autodesk Vault : Autodesk Vault plug-in, which ships with 3ds Max, consolidates users' 3ds Max assets in a single location, enabling them to automatically track files and manage work in progress. Users can easily and safely find, share, and reuse 3ds Max (and design) assets in a large-scale production or visualization environment.  The Data Channel modifier is a versatile tool for automating complex modelling operations. By piping mesh data through a series of controls, you can achieve a huge variety of effects that dynamically update as you make changes.  : Introduced with Max 2016, Max Creation Graph (MCG) enables users to create modifiers, geometry, and utility plug-ins using a visual node-based workflow. : With MCG the user can create a new plug-in for 3ds Max in minutes by simply wiring together parameter nodes, computation nodes, and output nodes. The resulting graph can then be saved in an XML file (.maxtool) or be packaged with any compounds (.maxcompound) it depends on in a ZIP file (.mcg) which can be shared easily with 3ds Max users. ; Open Shading Language (OSL) : Open shading language (OSL) lets you use a new OSL Map, an entire category of various OSL maps, and you can create your own OSL maps using development tools for use with any renderer. : Open shading language (OSL) is an open source shading language that is fairly simple to understand. It can be used in several different ways. You can use the OSL Map, which is an execution environment for OSL shaders inside of 3ds Max, and it works like any regular built-in 3ds Max map. There is also a category of pre-loaded OSL maps that you can easily use. In addition, you can use any OSL maps you download from the internet. Finally, you can creating a shader or map in OSL using our development tools. This is a much simpler method to create custom maps than developing the equivalent functionality as a 3ds Max C++ map. : ==Adoption ==  Many films have made use of 3ds Max, or previous versions of the program under previous names, in CGI animation, such as "Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar" and "2012 (film)|2012", which contain computer generated graphics from 3ds Max alongside live-action acting. Autodesk Mudbox|Mudbox was also used in the final texturing of the set and characters in Avatar, with 3ds Max and Autodesk Mudbox|Mudbox being closely related. 3ds Max has been used in the development of 3D computer graphics for a number of video games. Architectural and engineering design firms use 3ds Max for developing concept art and previsualization documents|previsualizati ...
