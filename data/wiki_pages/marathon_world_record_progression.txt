World records in the marathon are now ratified by World Athletics, the international Sport governing body|governing body for the sport of athletics (sport)|athletics. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge set a world record for men of 2:01:09 on September 25, 2022, at the 2022 Berlin Marathon. This run improved on his own previous world record by 30 seconds. In 2018, he broke the then world record by 1 minute and 18 seconds, the greatest improvement over a previous record since 1967. The IAAF recognizes two world records for women, a time of 2:14:04 set by Brigid Kosgei on October 13, 2019, during the Chicago Marathon, which was contested by men and women together, and a "Women Only" record of 2:17:01, set by Mary Keitany, on April 23, 2017, at the London Marathon for women only. ==Criteria for record eligibility==  For a performance to be ratified as a world record by the IAAF, the marathon course on which the performance occurred must be  long, measured in a defined manner using the Jones Counter|calibrated bicycle method (the distance in kilometers being the official distance, the distance in miles is an approximation) and meet other criteria that rule out artificially fast times produced on courses aided by downhill slope or tailwind. The criteria include: * "The start and finish points of a course, measured along a theoretical straight line between them, shall not be further apart than 50% of the race distance." * "The decrease in elevation between the start and finish shall not exceed an average of one in a thousand, i.e. 1m per km." In recognizing Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai's mark of 2:03:02 at the 2011 Boston Marathon as (at the time) "the fastest Marathon ever run", the IAAF said: "Due to the elevation drop and point-to-point measurements of the Boston course, performances  are not eligible for World record consideration." Road racing events like the marathon were specifically excepted from IAAF rule 260 18(d) that rejected from consideration those track and field performances set in mixed competition. The Association of Road Racing Statisticians, an independent organization that compiles data from road running events, also maintains an alternate marathon world best progression but with standards they consider to be more stringent.  The IAAF Congress at 2011 World Championships in Athletics passed a motion changing the record eligibility criteria effective October 6th 2007, so that women's world records must be set in all-women competitions. The result of the change was that Radcliffe's 2:17:42 performance at the 2005 London Marathon would supplant her own existing women's mark as the "world record"; the earlier performance was to be referred to as a "world best". The decision was met with strong protest in Britain, and in November 2011 an IAAF council member reported that Radcliffe's original mark would be allowed to stand, with the eventual decision that both marks would be recognized as "world records," the faster one as a "Mixed Gender" mark, the other as a "Women Only" mark. Per the 2021 IAAF Competition Rules, ""a World Record for performance achieved in mixed gender (“Mixed”) races and a World Record for performance achieved in single gender (“Women only”) races"" is tracked separately.  In December 2016, Nike, Inc., announced that three top distance runners — Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese and Lelisa Desisa — had agreed to forgo the spring marathon season to work with the company in an effort to run a sub-two-hour marathon, though a detailed plan to complete the marathon in 1:59:59 or faster was not released. The Breaking2 event took place in the early morning of May 6, 2017; Kipchoge crossed the finish line with a time of 2:00:25. This time was more than two minutes faster than the world record. Among other factors, specialized pacers were used, entering the race midway to help Kipchoge keep up the pace., Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 7-May-2017 Kipchoge took part in a similar attempt to break the two-hour barrier in Vienna on October 12, 2019, as part of the Ineos 1:59 Challenge. He successfully ran the first sub two-hour marathon distance, with a time of 1:59:40.2. The effort did not count as a new world record under IAAF rules due to the setup of the challenge. Specifically, it was not an open event, Kipchoge was handed fluids by his support team throughout, the run featured a pace car, and included rotating teams of other runners pacing Kipchoge in a formation designed to reduce wind resistance and maximize efficiency. The achievement was recognized by Guinness World Records with the titles ‘Fastest marathon distance (male)’ and ‘First marathon distance run under two hours’. ==History== Marathon races were first held in 1896, but the distance was not standardized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) until 1921. The actual distance for pre-1921 races frequently varied slightly from the present figure of 42.195&nbsp;km (26 miles 385 yards). In qualifying races for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Greek runners Charilaos Vasilakos (3:18:00) and Ioannis Lavrentis (3:11:27) won the first two modern marathons. On April 10, 1896, Spiridon Louis of Greece won Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|the first Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece, in a time of 2:58:50; however, the distance for the event was reported to be only 40,000 meters.|group=nb}} Three months later, British runner Len Hurst won the inaugural Paris Marathon|Paris to Conflans Marathon (also around 40&nbsp;km) in a time of 2:31:30. In 1900, Hurst would better his time on the same course with a 2:26:28 performance. Other sources confirm that the direction of the 1900 race was reversed but note Hurst's finishing time as 2:26:47.4{{cite book|last=Martin|first=David E.|author2=Roger W. H.
