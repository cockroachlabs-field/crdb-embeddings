   ""The Wanderings of Oisin"" ( ) is an Epic poetry|epic poem published by William Butler Yeats in 1889 in poetry|1889 in the book "The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems".#1889|Yeats 1889 It was his first publication outside magazines, and immediately won him a reputation as a significant poet.Matthew Russell (priest)|Matthew Russell reviewed the poem in the "Irish Monthly" (February 1889), stating "Ireland can boast of another true poet in William Yeats"; quoted in a later "Irish Monthly" (March 1953) article by Roger McHugh.  This narrative poem takes the form of a dialogue between the aged Ireland|Irish hero Oisín and St. Patrick, the man traditionally responsible for converting Ireland to Christianity.  Most of the poem is spoken by Oisin, relating his 300-year sojourn in the isles of Faerie. Oisin was not a popular poem with  modernism|modernist critics like TS Eliot."The poetry of the young Yeats hardly existed for me until after my enthusiasm had been won by the poetry of the older Yeats.." TS Eliot in The First Annual Yeats Lecture, Dublin 1940, collected in On Poetry & Poets, Faber 1957, quoted by John Kelly in his essay Eliot & Yeats, Yeats Annual no 20. However, Harold Bloom defended this poem in his book-length study of Yeats, and concludes that it deserves reconsideration.Bloom, H; "Yeats", Oxford University Press, 1970, ==Story== File:Musée Ingres-Bourdelle - Le songe d'Ossian, 1813 - Ingres - Joconde06070001439.jpg|thumb|"Ossian's Dream" by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Jean Ingres  The fairy princess Niamh fell in love with Oisin's poetry and begged him to join her in the immortal islands.  For a hundred years he lived as one of the Sidhe, hunting, dancing, and feasting. At the end of this time he found a spear washed up on the shore and grew sad, remembering his times with the Fianna.  Niamh took him away to another island, where the ancient and abandoned castle of the sea-god Manannan stood. Here they found another woman held captive by a demon, whom Oisin battled again and again for a hundred years, until it was finally defeated. They then went to an island where ancient giants who had grown tired of the world long ago were sleeping until its end, and Niamh and Oisin slept and dreamt with them for a hundred years. Oisin then desired to return to Ireland to see his comrades. Niamh lent him her horse warning him that he must not touch the ground, or he would never return. Back in Ireland, Oisin, still a young man, found his warrior companions dead, and the Paganism|pagan faith of Ireland displaced by Patrick's Christianity. He then saw two men struggling to carry a "sack full of sand";#1990|Yeats 1990: 444 (line 876) he bent down to lift it with one hand and hurl it away for them, but his saddle girth broke and he fell to the ground, becoming three hundred years old instantaneously. ==Structure== The poem is told in three parts, with the verse becoming more complex with each: the lines run four (iambic tetrameter), five (iambic pentameter), and six (Anapaest|anapaestic hexameter) metrical feet respectively.
