In "Hovertank 3D", the player controls Brick Sledge, a mercenary hired by an unknown organization (referred to by the game as the "UFA") to rescue people from cities under the threat of nuclear attack (largely political activists or scientists), both by the government and by large corporations. However, the cities are also full of Mutants in fiction|mutated humans, strange creatures and enemy hovertanks. == Gameplay == File:Hovertank 3D screen.png|thumb|"Hovertank 3D" gameplay The player must drive a hovertank through the levels and try to find the people Brick is supposed to rescue. There are many enemies in the levels, who are hunting down the people as well as the player. The player can keep track of both people and enemies in the radar box at the bottom of the screen. There is a timer that counts how long until the nuke is dropped. Once all the living people are collected a yellow teleporter appears somewhere in the level, and the player must find it to win. The player receives their fee, based on the number of people safely rescued, and how fast the operation was completed. All damage to the hovertank is repaired at the end of the level. ==Development== John Carmack's research in the game's engine took six weeks, two weeks longer than any id engine before it. The engine written for this game was expanded upon with texture mapping to make "Catacomb 3-D", and then later still with raycasting for "Wolfenstein 3D". Following the engine's completion, the id staff decided on the nuclear war theme and developed the game. Adrian Carmack enjoyed drawing the monsters and other ghoulish touches. The credits are John Carmack and John Romero as programmers, Tom Hall as game designer and Adrian Carmack as video game artist. The source code to the game, owned by Flat Rock Software, was released in June 2014 under GNU General Public License|GNU GPL-2.0-or-later in a manner similar John Carmack#Open-source software|those done by id and partners. ==Reception== "Hovertank 3D" is a landmark 3D game. Other 3D titles at the time, such as flight simulators and other games (such as "Alpha Waves") that had more detailed environments, were noticeably slower. A similar engine was used by "MIDI Maze" for the Atari ST in 1987 and "Wayout" for the Atari 8-bit family from 1982. ==Notes==  ==References==  ==External links== * *     Category:1991 video games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Vehicular combat games Category:First-person shooters Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Wolfenstein 3D engine games Category:Id Software games Category:Apocalyptic video games Category:Video games about nuclear war and weapons Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Tank simulation video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Sprite-based first-person shooters
