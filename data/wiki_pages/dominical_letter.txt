   "Dominical letters" or "Sunday letters" are a method used to determine the day of the week for particular dates. When using this method, each year is assigned a letter (or pair of letters for leap years) depending on which day of the week the year starts. Dominical letters are derived from the Roman practice of marking the repeating sequence of eight letters A–H (commencing with A on January 1) on stone calendars to indicate each day's position in the eight-day market week ("nundinae"). The word is derived from the number nine due to their practice of Counting#Inclusive counting|inclusive counting. After the introduction of Christianity a similar sequence of seven letters A–G was added alongside, again commencing with January 1. The "dominical letter" marks the Sundays. Nowadays they are used primarily as part of the computus, which is the method of calculating the date of Easter. A common year is assigned a single dominical letter, indicating which lettered days are Sundays in that particular year (hence the name, from Latin "dominica" for Sunday). Thus, 2023 is A, indicating that all A days are Sunday, and by inference, January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. Leap years are given two letters, the first valid for January 1 – February 28 (or February 24, see below), the second for the remainder of the year. In leap years, the leap day may or may not have a letter. In the Catholic version it does, but in the 1662 and subsequent Anglican versions it does not. The Catholic version causes February to have 29 days by doubling the sixth day before March 1, inclusive, thus both halves of the doubled day have a dominical letter of F.  (Calendar attached to the papal bull "Inter gravissimas"). The Anglican version adds a day to February that did not exist in common years, February 29, thus it does not have a dominical letter of its own."Anno vicesimo quarto Georgii II. c. 23" (1751), "The Statutes at Large, from Magna Charta to the end of the Eleventh Parliament of Great Britain, Anno 1761", ed. Danby Pickering, p. 194. After the 1662 reform there was correspondence between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the printer of the Book of Common Prayer, in which it was explained that the feast day of St Matthias now fell on February 24 every year. In either case, all other dates have the same dominical letter every year, but the days of the dominical letters change within a leap year before and after the intercalary day, February 24 or February 29. == History and arrangement == According to  dominical letters are:  Another one is "Add G, beg C, fad F," and yet another is "At Dover dwell George Brown, Esquire; Good Christopher Finch; and David Fryer." == Dominical letter cycle == {| class="wikitable"  |-	 !Months||  |-	 | January and October || A |-	 | May || B |-	 | August || C |-	 | February, March and November || D |- | June || E |-	 | September and December || F  |- | April and July || G |- | January, April and July || AG |-	 | October || BA |-	 | May || CB |-	 | February and August || DC |- | March and November || ED |-	 | June || FE |-	 | September and December || GF |} *If the letter () of the first day of a month is the dominical letter of the year, the month will have a Friday the 13th. That is to say, if the first day is Sunday, the 13th day will be Friday.  continues:   Of course, "24 February" is not "counted twice". The 23rd is "ante diem vii kalendas Martias", the next day in a leap year is "a.d. bis sextum kal. Mart.", the next day is the regular "a.d.vi kal. Mart.", and so to the end of the month. For example, in 2020 (=ED), all days preceding the leap day will correspond to a common-year E calendar, and all days afterward will correspond to a common-year D calendar. The relevant line of the "Februarius" page in the "Kalendarium" of a 1913 "Breviarium Romanum" reads: <blockquote> :<span style="color:red;">5</span> |f|vj|24|S. MATHIAE APOSTOLI, dupl. 2. class. </blockquote> The first column is the epact, a replacement for the Golden number (time)|golden number, from which the age of the moon was computed and announced in some English cathedrals prior to the Reformation. The second column is the letter, the third the Roman date and the fourth the modern date. A note at the foot of the page reads: <blockquote> <span style="color:red;">In anno bissextili mensis Februarius est dierum</span> 29. <span style="color:red;">et Festum S. Mathiae celebratur die</span> 25. <span style="color:red;">Februarii et bis dicitur</span> sexto Kalendas, <span style="color:red;">id est die</span> 24. <span style="color:red;">et die</span> 25. <span style="color:red;">et littera Dominicalis, quae assumpta fuit in mense Januario, mutatur in praecedentem; ut si in Januario littera Dominicalis fuerit</span> A, <span style="color:red;">mutatur in praecedentem, quae est</span> g. <span style="color:red;">etc.; et littera</span> f <span style="color:red;">bis servit,</span> 24. <span style="color:red;">et</span> 25.    (In a bissextile year the month February is of 29 days and the Feast of St Matthias is celebrated on 25 February, and twice is said on the sixth Kalends, that is on the 24th and 25th, and the Sunday letter, which was assumed in the month of January, is changed to the preceding; so if in January the Sunday letter may have been A, it is changed to the preceding, which is g. etc.; and letter f twice serves, 24th and 25th.) </blockquote> ==Dominical letters of the years== The dominical letter of a year provides the link between the date and the day of the week on which it falls. The following are the correspondences between dominical letters and the day of the week on which their corresponding years is day and date:   * "A": common year starting on Sunday has two Friday the 13ths in the January and October. * "B": common year starting on Saturday has one Friday the 13th in the May. * "C": common year starting on Friday has one Friday the 13th in the August. * "D": common year starting on Thursday has three Friday the 13ths in the February, March and November. * "E": common year starting on Wednesday has one Friday the 13th in the June. * "F": common year starting on Tuesday has two Friday the 13ths in the September and December. * "G": common year starting on Monday has two Friday the 13ths in the April and July. . * "AG": leap year starting on Sunday has three Friday the 13ths in the January, April and July. * "BA": leap year starting on Saturday has one Friday the 13th in the October. * "CB": leap year starting on Friday has one Friday the 13th in the May. * "DC": leap year starting on Thursday has two Friday the 13ths in the February and August. * "ED": leap year starting on Wednesday has two Friday the 13ths in the March and November. * "FE": leap year starting on Tuesday has one Friday the 13th in the June. * "GF": leap year starting on Monday has two Friday the 13ths in the September and December.  The Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years (i. e., every four centuries). Of the 400 years in one Gregorian cycle, there are: * 44 common years for each single Dominical letter D and F; * 43 common years for each single Dominical letter A, B, C, E, and G; * 15 leap years for each double Dominical letter AG and CB; * 14 leap years for each double Dominical letter ED and FE; * 13 leap years for each double Dominical letter BA, DC, and GF. Thus years which begin as A, C, or F occur 58 times in 400 years, years that begin as D or E 57 times, and those that begin as B or G just 56 times. The end of a year preceding a given year has the next letter (so A years are preceded by years ending as B), so years ending as B, D, or G occur 58 times in 400 years, those ending as E or F 57 times, and those ending as C or A 56 times. This means, for example, that Christmas falls on a Saturday or Monday (C and A years, resp.) 56 times in 400 years, whereas it falls on Friday, Sunday, or Tuesday (D, B, and G years, resp.) 58 times. The Julian calendar repeats every 28 years. Of the 28 years in one Julian cycle, there are: * 3 common years for each single Dominical letter A, B, C, D, E, F, and G; * 1 leap year for each double Dominical letter BA, CB, DC, ED, FE, GF, and AG. ==Calculation==  The dominical letter of a year can be calculated based on any method for calculating the day of the week, with letters in reverse order compared to numbers indicating the day of the week.

For example, to find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913: *1900 is G and 13 corresponds to 5 *G + 5 = G − 2 = E, 1913 is E Similarly, for 2007: *2000 is BA and 7 corresponds to 6 *A + 6 = A − 1 = G, 2007 is G For 2065: *2000 is BA and 65 mod 28 = 9 corresponds to 3 *A + 3 = A − 4 = D, 2065 is D  A simpler method suitable for finding the year's dominical letter was discovered in 2010. It is called the "odd plus 11" method. The procedure accumulates a running total "T" as follows: # Let "T" be the year's last two digits. #If "T" is odd, add 11.  #Let "T" = . #If "T" is odd, add 11. #Let "T" = "T" mod 7. #Count forward "T" letters from the century's dominical letter (A, C, E or G see above) to get the year's dominical letter. The formula is :<math> \left( \frac{y+11(y \bmod 2)}{2} + 11 \left(\frac{y+11(y \bmod 2)}{2}\bmod 2\right)\right) \bmod 7.</math>  This rule was stated by Augustus De Morgan: #Add 1 to the given year.  #Take the quotient found by dividing the given year by 4 (neglecting the remainder).  #Take 16 from the centurial figures of the given year if that can be done.  #Take the quotient of III divided by 4 (neglecting the remainder).  #From the sum of I, II and IV, subtract III.  #Find the remainder of V divided by 7: this is the number of the Dominical Letter, supposing A, B, C, ...
