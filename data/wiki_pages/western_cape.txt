It is the List of South African provinces by area|fourth largest of the nine provinces with an area of , and List of South African provinces by population|the third most populous, with an estimated 7 million inhabitants in 2020.Statistics South Africa, 2020. Mid- year population estimates. Available: http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022020.pdf About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of Cape Town, which is also the provincial capital. The Western Cape was created in 1994 from part of the former Cape Province. The two largest cities are Cape Town and George, Western Cape|George. ==Geography== File:Western Cape topography labelled (with provincial labels).svg|thumb|400px|left|Topography of the Western Cape. The Roggeveld and Nuweveld mountains are part of the Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment (see diagrams below). The other mountain ranges belong to the Cape Fold Belt, also shown in the diagrams below. The Western Cape's inland boundary lies for the most part at the foot of the Great Escarpment. The "Western Cape Province" is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the Cape of Good Hope, in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about  northwards along the Atlantic coast and about  eastwards along the South African south coast (Southern Indian Ocean). It is bordered on the north by the Northern Cape and on the east by the Eastern Cape. The total land area of the province is , about 10.6% of the country's total. It is roughly the size of England or the State of Louisiana. Its capital city and largest city is Cape Town, and some other major cities include Stellenbosch, Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester, Paarl, and George, South Africa|George. The Garden Route and the Overberg are popular coastal tourism areas. The Western Cape is the "southernmost region of the African continent" with Cape Agulhas as its southernmost point, only 3800&nbsp;km from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is Saldanha Bay on the west coast, about 140&nbsp;km north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour. The province's main harbour was built in Table Bay, which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off Table Mountain and Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.  The province is topographically exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the Cape Fold Belt, a set of nearly parallel ranges of Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone folded mountains of Cambrian-Ordovician age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330&nbsp;million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270&nbsp;million years ago).Compton, J. S. (2004). "The Rocks and Mountains of Cape Town". pp. 24-26, 44–70. Double Storey Books, Cape Town.McCarthy, T., Rubridge, B. (2005). "The Story of Earth and Life". pp. 188–195, 262–266. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.Truswell, J.F. (1977). "The Geological Evolution of South Africa". pp. 93–96, 114–159. Purnell, Cape Town. The height of the mountain peaks in the different ranges varies from 1000 m to 2300 m. The valleys between ranges are generally very fertile, as they contain the weathered loamy soils of the Cape Fold Belt#Bokkeveld Group|Bokkeveld mudstones (see the diagrams below). The far interior forms part of the Karoo. This region of the province is generally arid and hilly, with a Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|prominent escarpment that runs close to the Province's most inland boundary. <gallery mode="packed" heights="300px"> File:NS cross section Southern Cape.jpg|thumb|A diagrammatic 400&nbsp;km north–south crosssection through the Cape at approximately 21° 30' E (i.e. near Calitzdorp in the Little Karoo), showing the relationship between the Cape Fold Mountains (and their geological structure) and the Karoo Supergroup|geology of the Little and Great Karoo, as well as the position of the Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment. The colour code for the geological layers is the same as those used in the diagram above. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300&nbsp;km along the southern edge of the Swartberg Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale. </gallery> = The escarpment marks the southwestern edge of Geography of South Africa#Topographical Divisions|South Africa's central plateau (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left)."Atlas of Southern Africa". (1984). p. 13. Reader's Digest Association, Cape Town It runs parallel to the entire South African coastline, except in the very far northeast, where it is interrupted by the Limpopo River valley, and in the far northwest, where it is interrupted by the Orange River valley. The 1000&nbsp;km-long northeastern stretch of the escarpment is called the Drakensberg, which is geographically and geologically quite distinct from the Cape Fold Belt#Cape Supergroup|Cape Fold Mountains, which originated much earlier and totally independently of the origin of the escarpment.McCarthy, T.S. (2013) The Okavango delta and its place in the geomorphological evolution of Southern Africa. "South African Journal of Geology" 116: 1–54.Norman, n. & Whitfield, G. (2006). "Geological Journeys". p.290-300. Struik Publishers, Cape Town. = The principal rivers of the province are the Berg River|Berg and Olifants River (Western Cape)|Olifants which drain into the Atlantic Ocean, and the Breede River|Breede and Gourits River|Gourits which drain into the Indian Ocean.   The vegetation of the region is also extremely diverse, with one of the world's seven floral kingdoms almost exclusively endemic to the province, namely the Cape floristic region|Cape Floral Kingdom, most of which is covered by Fynbos (from the Afrikaans meaning "Fine Bush" (Dutch: Fijnbosch), though precisely how it came to be referred to as such, is uncertain.). These evergreen heathlands are extremely rich in species diversity, with at least as many plant species occurring on Table Mountain as in the entire United Kingdom. It is characterised by various types of shrubs, thousands of herbaceous flowering plant species and some grasses. With the exception of the Silver tree, "Leucadendron argenteum", which only grows on the granite and clay soils of the Cape Peninsula, open fynbos is generally treeless except in the wetter mountain ravines where patches of Afromontane forest persist. The arid interior is dominated by Karoo#Karoo flora|Karoo drought-resistant shrubbery. The Geography of South Africa#Namaqualand|West Coast and Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo are semi-arid regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and acacia trees. The Garden Route on the south coast (between the Outeniqua Mountains and the Southern Indian Ocean) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range. Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as Podocarpus|Yellowwood, Stinkwood and Ironwood trees.  The Western Cape is climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm Agulhas Current which flows southwards along South Africa's east coast, and the cold Benguela Current which is an upwelling current from the depths of the South Atlantic Ocean along South Africa's west coast.Branch, M & Branch G. (1981). "The Living Shores of Southern Africa." pp. 14–18. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.Tyson, P.D., Preston-Whyte, R.A. (2000) "The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa". pp. 221–223. Oxford University Press, Cape Town Thus climatic statistics can vary greatly over short distances. Most of the province is considered to have a Mediterranean climate with cool, we ...
