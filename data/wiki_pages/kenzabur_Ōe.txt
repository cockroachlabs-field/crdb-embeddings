His novels, short stories and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and literary theory, deal with political, social and philosophical issues, including nuclear weapons, nuclear power, anticonformism|social non-conformism, and existentialism. Ōe was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature for creating "an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today". , Yomiuri.co.jp; 18 May 2008. ==Early life and education== Ōe was born in , a village now in Uchiko, Ehime|Uchiko, Ehime Prefecture, on Shikoku. The third of seven children, he grew up listening to his grandmother, a storyteller of myths and folklore, who also recounted the oral history of the two uprisings in the region before and after the Meiji Restoration. His father, Kōtare Ōe, had a bark-stripping business; the bark was used to make paper currency. After his father died in the Pacific War in 1944, his mother, Koseki, became the driving force behind his education, buying him books including "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and "The Wonderful Adventures of Nils", which had a formative influence on him. Ōe received the first ten years of his education in local public schools. He started school during the peak of Japanese militarism|militarism in Japan; in class, he was forced to pronounce his loyalty to Emperor Hirohito, who his teacher claimed was a god. After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing. Ōe attended high school in Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama from 1951 to 1953, where he excelled as a student. At the age of 18, he made his first trip to Tokyo, where he studied at a prep school ("yobikō") for one year. The following year, he began studying French Literature at Tokyo University with Professor Kazuo Watanabe, a specialist on François Rabelais. == Career == Ōe began publishing stories in 1957, while still a student, strongly influenced by contemporary writing in France and the United States. His first work to be published was "Lavish are the Dead", a short story set in Tokyo during the American occupation, which appeared in "Bungakukai" literary magazine. His early works were set in his own university milieu. In 1958, his short story "Shiiku" (飼育) was awarded the prestigious Akutagawa Prize. The work was about a black GI set upon by Japanese youth, and was later made into a film, "The Catch" by Nagisa Oshima in 1961. Another early novella, later translated as "Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids", focused on young children living in Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian transformations of Ōe's own rural Shikoku childhood. Ōe identified these child figures as belonging to the 'Child (archetype)|child god' archetype of Carl Jung|Jung and Karl Kerényi|Kerényi, which is characterised by abandonment, hermaphrodism, invincibility, and association with beginning and end. The first two characteristics are present in these early stories, while the latter two features come to the fore in the 'idiot boy' stories which appeared after the birth of his son Hikari.  Between 1958 and 1961 Ōe published a series of works incorporating sexual metaphors for the occupation of Japan. He summarised the common theme of these stories as "the relationship of a foreigner as the big power , a Japanese who is more or less placed in a humiliating position , and, sandwiched between the two, the third party  (sometimes a prostitute who caters only to foreigners or an interpreter)".Ōe, "Ōe Kenzaburō Zensakuhin", Vol. 2 (Supplement No. 3). p. 16. In each of these works, the Japanese X is inactive, failing to take the initiative to resolve the situation and showing no psychological or spiritual development. The graphically sexual nature of this group of stories prompted a critical outcry; Ōe said of the culmination of the series "Our Times", "I personally like this novel  I do not think I will ever write another novel which is filled only with sexual words." In 1961, Ōe's novellas "Seventeen" and "The Death of a Political Youth" were published in the Japanese literary magazine "Bungakukai". Both were inspired by seventeen-year-old Yamaguchi Otoya, who had assassinated Japan Socialist Party chairman Inejirō Asanuma in October 1960, and then killed himself in prison three weeks later. Yamaguchi had admirers among the extreme right wing who were angered by "The Death of a Political Youth" and both Ōe and the magazine received death threats day and night for weeks. The magazine soon apologized to offended readers, but Ōe did not, and he was later physically assaulted by an angry right-winger while giving a speech at Tokyo University. Ōe's next phase moved away from sexual content, shifting this time toward the violent fringes of society. The works which he published between 1961 and 1964 are influenced by existentialism and picaresque literature, populated with more or less criminal rogues and anti-heroes whose position on the fringes of society allows them to make pointed criticisms of it. Ōe's admission that Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn" is his favorite book can be said to find a context in this period.Theroux, Paul. , nytimes.com, 8 February 1970.  File:The Healing Family Kenzaburo Oe.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover of the 1996 English version of Kenzaburō Ōe's book about his handicapped son and their life as a family. Ōe credited Hikari Ōe|his son Hikari for influencing his literary career. Ōe tried to give his son a "voice" through his writing. Several of Ōe's books feature a character based on his son. .   Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC), produced by Compassionate Healthcare Network (CHN). July 1995. In Ōe's 1964 book, "A Personal Matter", the writer describes the psychological trauma involved in accepting his brain-damaged son into his life. Hikari figures prominently in many of the books singled out for praise by the Nobel committee, and his life is the core of the first book published after Ōe was awarded the Nobel Prize. The 1996 book, "A Healing Family," celebrates the small victories in Hikari's life. Hikari was a strong influence on "Father, Where are you Going?", "Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness," and "The Day He Himself Shall Wipe My Tears Away," three novels which rework the same premise—the father of a disabled son attempts to recreate the life of his own father, who shut himself away and died. The protagonist's ignorance of his father is compared to his son's inability to understand him; the lack of information about his father's story makes the task impossible to complete, but capable of endless repetition, and, "repetition becomes the fabric of the stories."  In 2005, two retired Japanese military officers sued Ōe for libel for his 1970 book of essays, "Okinawa Notes", in which he had written that members of the Japanese military had coerced masses of Okinawan civilians into committing suicide during the Battle of Okinawa|Allied invasion of the island in 1945. In March 2008, the Osaka District Court dismissed all charges against Ōe. In this ruling, Judge Toshimasa Fukami stated, "The military was deeply involved in the mass suicides". In a news conference following the trial, Ōe said, "The judge accurately read my writing." Ōe did not write much during the nearly two years (2006–2008) of his libel case. He began writing a new novel, which "The New York Times" reported would feature a character "based on his father," a staunch supporter of the imperial system who drowned in a flood during World War&nbsp;II.  "Bannen Yoshikishu", his final novel, is the sixth in a series with the main character of Kogito Choko, who can be considered Ōe's literary alter ego. The novel is also in a sense a culmination of the I-novels that Ōe continued to write since his son was born mentally disabled in 1963. In the novel, Choko loses interest in the novel he had been writing when the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami struck the Tohoku region on 11 March 2011. Instead, he begins writing about an age of catastrophe, as well as about the fact that he himself was approaching his late 70s. == Activism == In 1959 and 1960, Ōe participated in the Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty as a member of a group of young writers, artists, and composers called the "Young Japan Society" ("Wakai Nihon no Kai"). The treaty allowed the United States to maintain m ...
