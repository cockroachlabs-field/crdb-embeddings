The genus name "gallinago" is New Latin for a woodcock or snipe from Latin "gallina", "hen" and the suffix "-ago", "resembling". The specific "delicata" is Latin for "dainty". This species was considered to be a subspecies of the common snipe ("G. gallinago") until 2003 when it was given its own species status, though not all authorities recognized this immediately. Wilson's snipe differs from the latter species in having a narrower white trailing edge to the wings, and eight pairs of Flight feather#Rectrices|tail feathers instead of the typical seven of the common snipe. Its common name commemorates the American ornithologist Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson. ==Description== Adults are  in length with a  wingspan. Weight ranges from . They have short greenish-grey legs and a very long straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath. They have a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. The wings are pointed. ==Breeding and habits== File:Wilson's Snipe Bolivar Peninsula TX 2018-03-25 14-38-06 (40145639795).jpg|left|thumb|260px|Wilson's snipe feeding They breed in marshes, bogs, tundra and wet meadows in Canada and the northern United States and on the Chukchi Peninsula, Russia. They are year-round residents on the U.S. West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast. The eastern population bird migration|migrates to the southern United States, the Caribbean, and to northern South America. It may be that global warming|climate change causes these birds to move to their breeding range earlier and leave later than 100 years ago. In Ohio for example, late April was recorded as an average migration date in 1906, but now most of the local population is present on the breeding grounds by then already.<!-- only references last sentence --> They forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight and eating insects, earthworms, and plant material. Well-camouflaged, they are usually shy and conceal themselves close to ground vegetation, flushing only when approached closely. They fly off in a series of aerial zig-zags to confuse predators. The male performs "winnowing" display during courtship, flying high in circles and then taking shallow dives to produce a drumming (snipe)|distinctive sound. They have been observed "winnowing" throughout the day and long into the night. The "winnowing" sound is similar to the call of a boreal owl. They nest in a well-hidden location on the ground. ==Population== The Wilson's snipe was reduced near the end of the 19th century by hunting and habitat destruction. However, this bird remains fairly common and not considered threatened by the IUCN, although local populations are sensitive to large-scale draining of wetland. ==References==  Ohio Ornithological Society (2004). . }} ==Further reading== * Bezener, A.
