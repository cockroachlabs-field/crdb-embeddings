Stevenage is east of junctions 7 and 8 of the A1(M) motorway|A1(M), between Letchworth Garden City to the north and Welwyn Garden City to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town under the New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act. == Etymology == "Stevenage" may derive from Old English language|Old English "stiþen āc" / "stiðen āc" / "stithen ac" (various Old English language|Old English dialects cited here) meaning "(place at) the stiff oak". The name was recorded as "Stithenæce" in  1060 and as "Stigenace" in the Domesday Book in 1086. ==History==  Stevenage lies near the line of the Roman road from Verulamium to Baldock. Some Romano-British remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered during house-building in the Chells Manor area in 1986. Other artefacts included a dodecahedron toy, fragments of amphorae for imported wine, bone hairpins, and samian ware pottery associated with high status families. Archeological excavations have confirmed the existence of a small Roman farmstead, a malting kiln and a Celtic Roundhouse (dwelling)|round house in the Chells area, and a cemetery containing 25 cremations. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is Six Hills, six tumulus|tumuli by the side of the old Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road that are presumably the burial places of members of a local family. The first Saxon people|Saxon camp, a little to the east of the Roman sites, was in a clearing in the woods where the church, the manor house and the first village were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall. Before the New Town was established, Shephall was a separate parish, and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth. During the 9th and 10th centuries AD, the Saxon village in Stevenage faced frequent attacks from Viking raiders. Stevenage was on the border of the Danelaw. A Viking spearhead was discovered by archaeologists at nearby Ardeley.  According to the Domesday Book, in 1086 the Lord of the Manor was the Abbot of Westminster Abbey. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road. In 1281 it was granted a Royal Charter to hold a weekly market and annual fair, still held in the High Street. The earliest part of St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas's Church dates from the 12th century, but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The list of rectors (parish priests) is relatively complete from 1213. Around 1500 the church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a clerestory. North of the Old Town is Jack's Hill, associated with the legendary archer Jack O'Legs of Weston, Hertfordshire|Weston. According to local folklore, Jack stole flour from the bakers of Baldock to feed the poor during a famine, like Robin Hood. The remains of a Medieval architecture|medieval moated homestead in Whomerley Wood comprise an 80-yard-square trench almost five feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle. Pieces of Roman and later pottery have been found there. Grade II* listed buildings in Stevenage|The oldest surviving house in Stevenage is Tudor House in Letchmore Street, built before 1500. During the 16th century it was a butcher's shop owned by a man named Scott. From 1773 onwards it served as the town's workhouse, and later became a school from 1835 until 1885. It was the headquarters of the local town gas company from c.1885 until 1936, when it was converted into a private dwelling. Chells Manor, a medieval hall house located three miles from the Old Town, was built in the 14th century for the Wake family on the foundations of a much older moated manor house mentioned in the Domesday Book. The site of the lost village of Chells was redeveloped during the extension of the #Stevenage New Town|New Town in the 1980s, and a hoard of Roman coins was discovered. In the present day, Chells is a suburb of New Stevenage.

In 1558 Thomas Alleyne, then the Rector of Stevenage, founded a free grammar school for boys, The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School, which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring Hitchin) until 1989, when it was merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. Francis Cammaerts was Headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed comprehensive school and is now an academy as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to Great Ashby, but the Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010–15) scrapped the move owing to Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts.
