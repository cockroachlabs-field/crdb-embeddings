It is a Brazilian timber tree commonly known as "Pernambuco wood" or "brazilwood" (, ; Tupian languages|Tupi: ) and is the list of national trees|national tree of Brazil. This plant has a dense, orange-red heartwood that takes a high shine, and it is the premier wood used for making bow (music)|bows for stringed instruments. The wood also yields a historically important red dye called brazilin, which oxidizes to brazilein. The name "pau-brasil" was applied to certain species of the genus "Caesalpinia" in the medieval period, and was given its original binomial name|scientific name "Caesalpinia echinata" in 1785 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. More recent taxonomic studies have suggested that it merits recognition as a separate genus, and it was thus renamed "Paubrasilia echinata" in 2016. The Latin binomial nomenclature|specific epithet of "echinata" refers to hedgehog, from "echinus", and describes the thorns which cover all parts of the tree (including the fruits). The name of Brazil is a shortened form of , 'land of brazilwood'. == Name == When Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese explorers found "Paubrasilia" on the coast of South America, they recognised it as a relative of an Asian species of sappanwood already used in Europe for producing red dye.  The Portuguese named these trees "pau-brasil", the term "pau" meaning wood, and "brasil" meaning reddish/ember-like. The South American trees soon dominated the trading as a better source of dye. Such a vigorous trade resulted from the woods that early sailors and merchants started referring to the land itself as "Terra do Brasil", or simply, the "Land of Brazil", and from this use the present name of Brazil was derived. Botanically, several tree species are involved, all in the family "Fabaceae" (the legume|pulse family). The term "brazilwood" is most often used to refer to the species "Paubrasilia echinata", but it is also applied to other species, such as "Caesalpinia sappan" and "Haematoxylum brasiletto".  The tree is also known by other names, as "Ibirapitanga", Tupian languages|Tupi for "red wood"; or "pau de pernambuco", named after the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. In the bow-making business it is usual to refer to some species other than "Paubrasilia echinata" as "brazilwood"; examples include pink ipê ("Handroanthus impetiginosus"), Massaranduba ("Manilkara bidentata") and palo brasil ("Haematoxylum brasiletto"). The highly prized "Paubrasilia echinata" is usually called "Pernambuco wood" in this particular context. ==Description== The brazilwood tree may reach up to  in height, and the dark brown bark flakes in large patches, revealing the lustrous blood-red heartwood underneath. The leaves are pinnate and each consists of between 9 and 19 small, leathery leaflets, which are broadly oblong in shape. The flower stalk, or inflorescence, is also branched and contains between 15 and 40 yellow, strongly perfumed flowers, which may be pollinated by bees. The petals are usually yellow with a blood-red blotch. The fruits are oval-shaped woody seedpods, measuring up to  long and  across; they hang off the branches and after the seeds are expelled, the pods become twisted. The branches, leaves and fruit are covered with small thorns. There are some important differences between geographically distinct populations and it is thought that separate subspecies of the pau brasil may exist. This tree may have some medicinal properties and has been used as an astringent and antidiuretic by local people; extracts have been tested as possible cancer treatments. ==Historical importance== Image:Caesalpinia echinata Taub95.png|thumb|250px|left|An illustration of the tree leaves and flowers. Starting in the 16th century, brazilwood became highly valued in Europe and quite difficult to get. A related wood, sappanwood, coming from Asia was traded in powder form and used as a brazilin|red dye in the manufacture of luxury textiles, such as velvet, in high demand during the Renaissance. When Portuguese navigators landed in present-day Brazil, on April 22, 1500, they immediately saw that brazilwood was extremely abundant along the coast and in its hinterland, along the rivers. In a few years, a hectic and very profitable operation for logging|felling and shipping all the brazilwood logs they could get was established, as a crown-granted Portuguese monopoly. The rich commerce which soon followed stimulated other nations to try to harvest and smuggle brazilwood contraband out of Brazil, and Privateer|corsairs to attack loaded Portuguese ships in order to steal their cargo. For example, the unsuccessful attempt in 1555 of a French expedition led by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, vice-admiral of Brittany and corsair under the King, to establish a colony in present-day Rio de Janeiro (France Antarctique) was motivated in part by the bounty generated by economic exploitation of brazilwood. In addition, this plant is also cited in "Flora Brasiliensis" by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. == Excessive harvesting == Excessive harvesting led to a steep decrease in the number of brazilwood trees in the 18th century, causing the collapse of this economic activity. Presently, the species is nearly Local extinction|extirpated in most of its original range. Brazilwood is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, and it is cited in the official list of endangered flora of Brazil. File:Bow Cello2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A cello bow The trade of brazilwood is likely to be banned in the immediate future, creating a major problem in the Bow (music)|bow-making industry which highly values this wood.Smithsonian, April 2004, cover story The International Pernambuco Conservation Initiative (IPCI), whose members are the bowmakers who rely on pernambuco for their livelihoods, is working to replant the trees. IPCI advocates the use of other woods for violin bows to raise money to plant pernambuco seedlings.  The shortage of pernambuco has also helped the Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber and composite bow industry to thrive. "", a feature-length Documentary film|documentary on the plight of this species, was finished in 2009. == Replanting efforts == Restoration of the species in the wild is hampered by the fact that it is a climax community species, which will develop well only when planted amongst secondary forest vegetation.Cf. Backes, P. & Irgang, B., "Mata Atlântica: as árvores e a paisagem" ("Atlantic Reinforest: its trees and landscape"), Porto Alegre, Paisagem do Sul, 2004, page 228 Although many saplings have been distributed or sold during recent decades, that has led to the tree being planted in places outside its natural range, with somewhat poor results, such as happens with brazilwood trees used for urban landscaping in the city of São Paulo, whose development and flowering is usually hampered by the colder environment.Cf. , Ricardo Cardim 15 December 2009 blog entry; "Coisa rara no clima paulistano, as inúmeras árvores de pau-brasil (Caesalipinia echinata) plantadas pela cidade estão frutificando abundantemente." (in exceptional circumstances, however, brazilwood may flower in São Paulo)  == Gallery ==  ==References==   ==External links==   * * * from a bowmaker's website. * *  *   Category:Caesalpinieae Category:Endemic flora of Brazil Category:Trees of Brazil Category:Endangered plants Category:Flora of Bahia Category:Flora of Pernambuco Category:Flora of Rio Grande do Norte Category:Flora of Rio de Janeiro (state) Category:Plant dyes Category:Plants described in 1785 Category:Endangered flora of South America Category:Taxa named by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck Category:Monotypic Fabaceae genera
