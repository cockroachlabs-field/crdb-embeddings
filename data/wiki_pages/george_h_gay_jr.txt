Gay Jr. (right), sole survivor of VT-8's TBD Devastator group, in front of his aircraft with his rear gunner, ARM3c George Arthur Field, while "Hornet" was in the Coral Sea, c. May 1942. During the Battle of Midway, Gay was the first of his squadron to take off from "Hornet" on June 4, 1942. Gay's unit found the Japanese carrier fleet and launched an attack without any Fighter aircraft|fighter plane support. Although he was wounded and his radioman/gunner, Robert K. Huntington, was dying, Gay completed his torpedo attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier , but "Sōryū" evaded his torpedo. Rather than banking away from the ship and presenting a larger target to its anti-aircraft gunners, Gay continued in toward the carrier at low altitude. He then brought his Devastator into a tight turn as he approached the carrier's Aircraft carrier#Deck structures|island, and flew aft along the flight deck's length, thus evading anti-aircraft fire. He later stated he had a "split second" thought of crashing into the Japanese aircraft he saw being serviced on the flight deck.  With his aircraft still in relatively good condition, he decided to make for "Hornet" after clearing the Japanese carrier. However, five Mitsubishi A6M Zeros brought his aircraft down in a hail of machine gun and cannon fire, killing his rear gunner, ARM3c Robert K. Huntington. Exiting his aircraft, and floating in the ocean, he hid under his seat cushion for hours to avoid Japanese strafing attacks and witnessed the Battle of Midway#Attacks on the Japanese fleet|subsequent dive bombing attacks and sinking of three of the four Japanese aircraft carriers present.Joe James Custer (United Press), "Watches Jap Carriers Go By in Flames", Waterloo Daily Courier, 1942-06-09 at 1, available at NewspaperArchive.com.

HORNET (CV-8), during the "Air Battle of Midway," against enemy Japanese forces on 4 June 1942. Grimly aware of the hazardous consequences of flying without fighter protection, and with insufficient fuel to return to his carrier, Ensign Gay, resolutely, and with no thought of his own life, delivered an effective torpedo attached against violent assaults of enemy Japanese aircraft and against an almost solid barrage of anti-aircraft fire. His courageous action, carried out with a gallant spirit of self-sacrifice and a conscientious devotion to the fulfillment of his mission, was a determining factor in the defeat of the enemy forces and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.</blockquote> ==References==  ==External links== *  *  *    Category:1917 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Battle of Midway Category:Shot-down aviators Category:Sole survivors Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:United States Navy officers Category:United States Navy bomber pilots of World War II Category:People from Waco, Texas Category:Texas A&M University alumni Category:Military personnel from Texas Category:Burials at sea
