Its history traces back to the foundation of Sheffield Medical School in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884. University College of Sheffield was subsequently formed by the amalgamation of the three institutions in 1897 and was granted a royal charter as University of Sheffield in 1905 by King Edward VII. Sheffield is formed from 50 academic departments which are organised into five faculties and an international faculty. The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £817 million, of which £204.8 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £889.5 million. Known for world-leading engineering research, the university has partnerships with over 125 companies including BAE Systems, Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Airbus at the Advanced Manufacturing Park spread over 150 acres of land. Sheffield ranks among the top 10 of UK universities for research grant funding, and it has become number one in the UK for income and investment in engineering research according to new data published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). It is the 7th largest British university by List of universities in the United Kingdom by enrolment#Universities and other higher education providers by size|postgraduate student enrollment behind University College London|UCL, King's College London|King's, University of Manchester|Manchester, University of Birmingham|Birmingham, University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh and University of Oxford|Oxford. The university is one of the original red brick universities and a founding member of the prestigious Russell Group. It is also part of the Worldwide Universities Network, the N8 Group of the eight most research intensive universities in Northern England and the White Rose University Consortium. Sheffield has been ranked as a top 100 university in the world by QS World University Rankings|QS for the last fifteen years. In 2019, Time Higher Education ranked the university 22nd in Europe for teaching excellence. According to the latest Research Excellence Framework 2021, Sheffield is ranked 11th in the UK for research power calculated by multiplying the institution's GPA by the total number of full-time equivalent staff submitted. There are eight Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates affiliated with Sheffield and six of them are the alumni or former long-term staff of the university. They are contributors to the development of penicillin, the discovery of the citric acid cycle, the investigation of high-speed chemical reactions, the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA, the discovery of fullerene, and the development of molecular machines. Alumni also include several Head of state|Heads of state, Home Secretary|Home Secretaries, Court of Appeal judge (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal judges, Booker Prize winners, astronaut and Olympic Games|Olympic gold medallists. ==History==   The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three local institutions: the Sheffield School of Medicine, Firth College, and the Sheffield Technical School. With a history dating back to as early as the 1810s, the Sheffield School of Medicine is the university's oldest predecessor institution, which is also the oldest higher education establishment in Sheffield. In 1795, the Sheffield Royal Infirmary|General Infirmary was opened, becoming the first hospital in the city. Because of the Apprenticeship|apprenticeship-type training, the medical education at that time was largely unstructured. Regarded as the father of Sheffield's medical education, surgeon apothecary Hall Overend began to train medical students in 1811. His school of anatomy and medicine was externally recognised in 1828, and he conducted and taught human dissection in an anatomy museum at his home in Church Street, Sheffield|Church Street. Overend, however, was not officially registered as a lecturer with the Society of Apothecaries, a recognised body for medical education. Physicians and surgeons of the General Infirmary suggested that a school associated with the hospital would be highly eligible for recognition by the society. As a result, in 1828, a public meeting was called by physician Sir Arnold Knight, and supported by Overend, to establish a new medical school. The Sheffield Medical Institution was formally opened a year later in 1829 on Surrey Street, with the Latin motto "Ars longa vita brevis" (Art is long, life is short), which refers to the difficulty to acquire and practice the art of Medicine. Knight laid the foundation stone and delivered the opening lecture. The University Extension Movement emerged in the 1870s with the aim of providing education in the city which lacked any tertiary institutions.{{cite bo ...
