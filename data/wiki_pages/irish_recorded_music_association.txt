In the mid-1990s IRMA presented the IRMA Music Awards. These have been replaced by the annual music awards show Meteor Ireland Music Awards. In the past IRMA has organised "The IRMA Honours," an awards ceremony which honours the life work of Ireland's leading musicians and people who have influenced the Irish music industry. Past recipients include Bob Geldof, Larry Gogan and Christy Moore.  On 12 April 2005, the association began to take legal action against "serial filesharers" in Ireland who illegally distribute music on the Internet. On 15 November 2005, the IRMA began "Phase II" of its plan to battle filesharing. On 12 June 2013, IRMA secured an Order of the High Court to block access to The Pirate Bay to all internet users in Ireland.   IRMA and Eircom reached an agreement over file sharing which uses a third-party organisation to monitor Eircom users for downloading of infringing music., John Collins, The Irish Times, 6 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009. The agreed system was reported to use a "three-strikes-and-you're-out" system. The agreement was criticised by Digital Rights Ireland and IrelandOffline., Marie Boran, Silicon Republic, 26 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009. The association sent solicitors' letters to several organisations, including Internet hosting service|hosting service Blacknight Solutions, whose MD, Michele Neylon, made the copy sent to his company publicly available on the company site. , Ralph Averbuch, ENN.ie, 26 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009. Although Blacknight Solutions is not an ISP they still received the letter, which stated "in the event of a positive response to this letter it is proposed to make practical arrangements with Blacknight of a like nature to those made with Eircom".  Protests against some actions of IRMA are being organised by Digital Rights Ireland, as well as Blackout Ireland. == The IRMA trust == In 1997 the IRMA set up a trust with Phonographic Performance Ireland, with the aim to enhance the opportunities for young people who want to pursue a career in music. The trust's main initiative is the Instrument Bank, which provides music instruments to young people, particularly to young people who live in disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland. == Awards == Since July, 2021 IRMA has awarded the number one selling album and single of the week with a specially commissioned award designed by NCAD design students Katie O’Brien and Kate McKenna. The trophy design – the number one and a musical note entwined – was made using brushed aluminium and black recycled acrylic. This award is different to the awards show presented by IRMA in the 1990s. The IRMA Music Awards were discontinued in the late 1990s replaced with the Meteor Ireland Music Awards and later the Choice Music Prize. == See also == *Music industry *List of albums certified by the Irish Recorded Music Association *List of artists who reached number one in Ireland *List of one-hit wonders in Ireland *List of songs that reached number one on the Irish Singles Chart *Irish Singles Chart *Irish Albums Chart == References ==  == External links == * *    Category:Music organisations based in the Republic of Ireland Category:Music industry associations Category:Trade associations based in the Republic of Ireland
