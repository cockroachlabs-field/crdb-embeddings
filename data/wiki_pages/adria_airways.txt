(formerly "Inex-Adria Aviopromet" and later "Inex-Adria Airways") was the flag carrier of Slovenia, operating scheduled and charter services to European destinations. The company's head office was at Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport in Zgornji Brnik, Cerklje na Gorenjskem, near Ljubljana. On 30 September 2019, the airline declared bankruptcy and ceased all operations. ==History==  File:Inex-Adria Airways Douglas DC-6B Volpati.jpg|thumb|right|Inex-Adria Douglas DC-6B at Le Bourget Airport (1971) The airline was founded in March 1961 as "Adria Aviopromet" ("Adria Airways"). In August the company purchased two Douglas DC-6|DC-6B from KLM and flew their first commercial flight with a Dutch crew. At the same time, the first Adria crew and technical teams were trained by JAT Yugoslav Airlines and the air force. Adria carried out its first flight with a domestic crew in December 1961. At the same time all other activities necessary for the company were set up and organised, from the commercial to the accounting department.Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p31 During the following years, Adria gradually acquired a market with tourist flights from Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia to airports on the Adriatic coast. In 1964, flights to the United States and Canada were added in order to meet the needs of expatriate organisations. Adria also carried out a considerable number of flights for the United Nations. With the opening of the new airport in Ljubljana airport|Ljubljana in 1964, Adria relocated its base from its previous headquarters in Zagreb. The Douglas DC-6|DC-6B aircraft gradually became non-competitive on the market. The company fell into a serious crisis in 1967, which ended with a bankruptcy procedure at 1968. After a compulsory settlement, Adria continued its operations largely thanks to the efforts of the president of the Slovenian Chamber of the Commerce and Industry of the time. In December 1968, Adria merged with the Serbian company InterExport based in Belgrade and changed its name from Adria Aviopromet to Inex-Adria Aviopromet (Inex-Adria Airways). The fleet renewal began. File:Adria Airways Caravelle Manteufel.jpg|thumb|Inex-Adria Caravelle in 1972  In 1969, the first jet aircraft was purchased, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 with 115 seats. Thus began a period of modernisation of the fleet, which allowed Adria to increase its share on the tourist flights market. In September 1969 the first scheduled service was established on the Ljubljana-Belgrade route. In March 1970, Adria had four Douglas DC-6B and a Douglas DC-9-30 with one more on order.Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p33 File:Inex Adria Douglas DC-9 Marmet-1.jpg|thumb|right|Inex-Adria Douglas DC-9-33 at Frankfurt Airport in 1976 Business saw a considerable increase. Adria, in addition to expanding the number of its own aircraft, occasionally also leased aircraft (Sud Aviation Caravelle, Douglas DC-8, BAC One-Eleven). In 1972, Adria renewed its transatlantic flights to the United States and Canada with Douglas DC-8-55 aircraft. However, it withdrew from that service next year. In the late 1970s, Adria was awarded as most punctual carrier on the charter flight market. The greatest commercial successes of that period were achieved on the German market which was also the largest at that time, in a productive partnership with Grimex Company. The number of flights to Great Britain, France, Spain and Scandinavia also increased. During that period, Adria also introduced flights within Yugoslavia. The company paid a great deal of attention to education. It founded a professional education centre and assisted in setting up an aviation course at the engineering faculty in Ljubljana. Special emphasis was given to the development of safety awareness, as three accidents occurred during the last decade.  File:Adria Airways DHC-7 Maiwald.jpg|thumb|Adria DHC-7 at Stuttgart Airport in 1989 Inex-Adria Aviopromet (Inex-Adria Airways) entered the 1980s as a respectable company with confirmed success on the tourist market and scheduled internal flights.Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p35 In May 1981 Adria purchased three new McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. Unfortunately, one of them Inex-Adria Aviopromet Flight 1308|crashed into a mountain in Corsica in December, killing all aboard. In 1982, Adria got a new leadership which focused on the education of the flight crews, technical staff and other professional personnel as well as on ensuring safety. In that period, the business remained focused on charter flights to the Adriatic. Flights for Foreign worker|guest workers in Germany and Switzerland, which were connected to internal flights, became an important part of the business. At the end of 1984, the first scheduled international flights were also established on the Ljubljana–Belgrade–Larnaca route. Prospects for the development of air traffic were very good, so in 1984, Adria signed a contract for the purchase of 5 Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320 aircraft. Also two new de Havilland Canada Dash 7|Dash 7 aircraft were bought for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.

A year later another MD-82 joined the fleet. Due to a commercial law restructuring programme, in 1986, Adria left the Inex group, becoming an independent company and changing its name to Adria Airways. Later, Adria became a member of International Air Transport Association|IATA. In 1989, the first new Airbus A320 arrived. It was 43rd A320 made by the Airbus and the first one to be powered by the new International Aero Engines|IAE Engines.

In December 1990, a referendum on the History of Slovenia|independence of Slovenia was held, in which the overwhelming majority of Slovenian residents (around 89%) voted for independence. Independence was declared on 25 June 1991. Following that, Adria was facing an entirely new set of circumstances. On Ten-Day War|28 June 1991, the Yugoslav Federal Air Force attacked Adria's hangar, causing serious damage to four aircraft, the building and various other vehicles. An Airbus A320, less than a year old, was heavily damaged and was flown to Toulouse later that year for almost a year of repairs. In addition, two de Havilland Canada Dash 7|Dash 7s and a DC-9-30 were damaged as well, while other planes escaped damage after being flown just hours earlier to the nearest airport of Klagenfurt. Adria was very handicapped that year because of insurance and registration issues.Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p37 In 1991, Adria had 13 aircraft: three Airbus A320s (two were delivered in September 1990), four MD-82s, one MD-81, three DC-9-30s and two Dash 7s. Two A320s, expected to arrive in June 1991, were sold to other airlines. Flights began in 1992, when Adria Airways re-established its activities on a truncated market. The majority of charter destinations from Western Europe to the Adriatic coast had become inaccessible as they were now situated on the territory of other countries. The fleet was too big, so many aircraft were leased out across the globe. Adria Airways became Slovenia's national air carrier and its operational structure changed. From being largely a charter airline it transformed itself into a scheduled operator. Adria began to set up a network of scheduled flights around Europe to serve the needs of an independent Slovenia. Later in 1992, the company joined the Amadeus global travel distribution system. A period of restructuring and rehabilitation of the company began. In the next years, Adria's A320s were mainly leased out, as well as MD-82s. An MD-81 and an MD-82 were sold in 1994. The other three MD-82 and a DC-9-30 were sold at the end of 1995. As part of an ownership restructuring, in February 1996, the Government of Slovenia obtained a 100% share in the company. In 1996, in line with the administration's rescue programme, a rehabilitation procedure was started the aim of which was to enable the company to run on market principles. The main emphasis was on the rationalization and modernization of the operations and the adaptation of the fleet to market requirements. The number of employees has been reduced from 931 to 618. In 1996, the fleet consisted of three Airbus A320 with 168 seats (at least two were leased out most of the time), two DC-9-30 with 105 seats and two Dash-7 with 46 seats. Adria started a corporation with Lufthansa later in 1996. In April 1997, Adria ordered two new Bombardier CRJ200LR planes with an option for one more. Planes were delivered in 1998 when two de Havilland Canada Dash 7|Dash-7 and two McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9-30 left the fleet. Another CRJ200LR arrived in late 1998. Bombardier CRJ200LR were chosen as the best option for flights operated from Ljubljana, which allowed for more flights to be flown directly and more frequent. CRJ200LR are in 48 seats configuration which give space for a larger baggage compartment needed for charters. In 1999, Adria's fleet consisted of three Airbus A320, which were now operating back home, and three CRJ200LR. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the airline head office was in Ljubljana."World Airline Directory." "Flight International". 18–24 March 1998. . "Kuzmiceva 7, Ljubljana. 1000, Slovenia".

Cities like Sarajevo, Skopje, Ohrid, Tirana were connected with Scandinavia, United Kingdom|UK, Germany and France. After the Kosovo War ended in 1999, Adria was the first airline fly to Pristina in the winter period of 1999.Adria Airways Winter 1999-2000 Timetable In March 2000, the 4th new 48 seats Bombardier CRJ200LR arrived. Maribor, the second largest city in Slovenia was connected with Munich for a short period of time in the summer of 2000. There were 5 weekly flights around noon. In 2001, Adria Airways recorded a large decrease in the number of annual passengers as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the winter of 2001, Adria started flying in the European Union|EU market, starting with the Vienna-Frankfurt route. In July 2002, Bombardier Aerospace selected Adria as the first authorised heavy maintenance facility for CRJ aircraft in Europe. In the spring of 2003, Adria leased a Bombardier CRJ100LR with 50 seats from Bombardier; the lease lasted until January 2011. In August 2004, Adria was among the first airlines in the world to obtain an IATA Operational Safety Audit|IOSA certificate. The 6th Bombardier CRJ200LR with 50 seats was leased from GECAS.
