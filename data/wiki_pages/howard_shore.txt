Shore is Jews|Jewish. He started studying music at the age of 8 or 9. He learned a multitude of instruments and began playing in bands at the ages of 13 and 14. When Shore was 13, he met and became good friends with a young Lorne Michaels in summer camp, and this friendship would later be influential in his career. By 17, he decided he wanted to pursue music in his adult life too. He studied music at Berklee College of Music in Boston after graduating from Forest Hill Collegiate Institute. From 1969 to 1972, Shore was a member of the jazz fusion band Lighthouse (band)|Lighthouse. In 1970, he became the music director for Lorne Michaels and Hart Pomerantz's short-lived TV program "The Hart & Lorne Terrific Hour". Shore wrote the music for Canadian magician Doug Henning's magic musical "Spellbound" in 1974 and, from 1975 to 1980, he was the musical director for Lorne Michaels' influential late-night NBC comedy show "Saturday Night Live", appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band, and dressed as a beekeeper for a John Belushi/Dan Aykroyd performance of the Slim Harpo classic "I'm a King Bee". Shore also suggested the name for The Blues Brothers to Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. ==Film scoring==  Shore's first film score was to the low budget thriller "I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses" (1978), followed by David Cronenberg's first major film, "The Brood" (1979). He would go on to score all of Cronenberg's subsequent films, with the exception of "The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone" (1983), which was scored by Michael Kamen. The first film he scored that was not directed by Cronenberg was Martin Scorsese's "After Hours (film)|After Hours" (1985). Following that, he scored "The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly" (1986), again directed by Cronenberg. Two years later, he composed the score to "Big (film)|Big" (1988), directed by Penny Marshall and starring Tom Hanks. He then scored two more of David Cronenberg's films: "Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers" (1988) and "Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch" (1991). During 1991, Shore composed the score for the highly acclaimed film "The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs", starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, and directed by Jonathan Demme. He received his first British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA nomination for the score. The film became the third (and most recent) to win the five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress). Shore is the only living composer to have scored a "Top Five" Oscar-winning film. During 1993, he composed the scores for "M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly" (another collaboration with Cronenberg), "Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia" (his second collaboration with Jonathan Demme), and "Mrs. Doubtfire", directed by Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus. The latter two films were highly successful, "Philadelphia" winning Tom Hanks his first Oscar. Shore scored another three films in 1994: "The Client (1994 film)|The Client", "Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood", and "Nobody's Fool (1994 film)|Nobody's Fool". "Ed Wood" is notable for being one of the three films directed by Tim Burton that did not feature a score by Danny Elfman. Shore continued to score numerous films from 1995 to 2001, including two David Fincher films, "Seven (1995 film)|Seven" (1995) and "The Game (1997 film)|The Game" (1997), and "The Truth About Cats and Dogs" (1996), directed by Michael Lehmann; he also collaborated on two films with Cronenberg, along with Tom Hanks' directorial debut, "That Thing You Do!".

File:Howard Shore.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Shore at a press conference for "The Lord of the Rings" in Wellington, New Zealand, 2003 Major success came in 2001 with his score to "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", the first film in the highly acclaimed "The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy". The news that Shore would score the trilogy surprised some, since he was primarily associated with dark, ominous films and had never scored an epic of this scale. However, the score was hugely successful and won Shore his first Oscar, as well as a Grammy Award, and garnered Shore nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA. The music editor on the trilogy was Suzana Peric.   The following year, Shore composed the scores to "Panic Room", "Gangs of New York" (replacing Elmer Bernstein), and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers", the second film in the trilogy. (The latter two films were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.) Initially, Shore's score for "The Two Towers" was going to be deemed ineligible for submission to the Academy, due to a new rule that disallowed the submission of scores which contained themes from previous work. However, the implementation of this rule change was subsequently postponed, meaning the score remained eligible. Ultimately, "The Two Towers" score did not receive an Academy Award nomination; Shore did, however, receive a BAFTA nomination for "Gangs of New York". In 2003, he composed the score for the final film in "The Lord of the Rings trilogy", "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King". The film was the most successful film in the trilogy and the most successful of the year. Shore won his second Oscar for Best Original Score, as well as a third for Best Original Song for "Into the West (song)|Into the West", which he shared with Fran Walsh and Annie Lennox. Shore also won his first Golden Globe, his third and fourth Grammy (the fourth for Best Song), and was nominated for a third BAFTA. The scores of "The Lord of the Rings", performed primarily by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, became one of the most successful film scores ever written and the biggest success in Shore's career. The score has been repeatedly voted to be the best film score, and the review site Filmtracks named Shore's score "arguably the most respected and impressive trilogy of music of all time: Howard Shore's massive work for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings." In 2004, Shore again collaborated with Martin Scorsese, scoring his epic film "The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator", this time with the Brussels Philharmonic. He won a second Golden Globe for the score, becoming the third composer to have won consecutive Golden Globes in the Original Score category. He also received his sixth Grammy nomination, and his fifth BAFTA nomination. He collaborated again with David Cronenberg in 2005 to score "A History of Violence", starring Viggo Mortensen. The film was a success and received two Oscar nominations. In 2006, he collaborated for the fourth time with Martin Scorsese, this time to score "The Departed". The film was highly successful and won four Oscars, including a long-awaited win for Scorsese, and Best Picture. Although Shore was originally commissioned to compose the soundtrack for "King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong", he was later replaced by James Newton Howard due to "differing creative aspirations for the score" on his and the filmmakers' parts.& ...
