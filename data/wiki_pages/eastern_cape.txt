Its capital is Bhisho, but its two largest cities are East London, Eastern Cape|East London and Port Elizabeth|Gqeberha. The second largest province in the country (at 168,966&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) after Northern Cape, it was formed in 1994 out of the Xhosa people|Xhosa homelands or bantustans of Transkei and Ciskei, together with the eastern portion of the Cape Province. The central and eastern part of the province is the traditional home of the indigenous Xhosa people. In 1820 this area which was known as the Xhosa Kingdom began to be settled by Europeans who originally came from England and some from Scotland and Ireland. Since South Africa's early years, many Xhosas believed in Africanism and figures such as Walter Rubusana believed that the rights of Xhosa people and Africans in general, could not be protected unless Africans mobilized and worked together. As a result, the Eastern Cape is home to many anti-apartheid leaders such as Robert Sobukwe, Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Winnie Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Alfred Xuma, Cecilia Makiwane, Noni Jabavu among others. It is also home the then young Thabo Mbeki, Chris Hani, Bantu Holomisa, Steve Biko, musicians Miriam Makeba, Madosini, Nathi, Vusi Nova and Zahara (South African musician)|Zahara as well as historical figures such as Tiyo Soga|Rev. Tiyo Soga, Samuel Mqhayi, Mongezi Sifika wa Nkomo, Enoch Sontonga and Jotello Festiri Soga. ==History== The Eastern Cape as a South African Province came into existence in 1994 and incorporated areas from the former Xhosa homelands of the Transkei and Ciskei, together with what was previously part of the Cape Province. This resulted in several anomalies including the fact that the Province has four supreme courts (in Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown (Makhanda), Port Elizabeth (Gqeberha), Bhisho and Mthatha) and had enclaves of KwaZulu-Natal in the province. The latter anomaly has fallen away with amendments to municipal and provincial boundaries. The Xhosa Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in Africa and had all states in the Eastern Cape as tributaries. Any group, people or tribe that recognized the Xhosa Kingdom as Paramouncy became Xhosa, practiced Xhosa culture and used isiXhosa as their main language. Some of the tribes that fall under the category of Xhosa people include: AmaMpondo, AbaThembu, AmaMpondomise, AmaHlubi, AmaBhaca, AmaXesibe, AmaBomvana and more.   In the late 18th century the Dutch Cape Colony slowly expanded eastwards from its original centre around Cape Town. This led to the establishment in 1786 of the Dutch settlement of Graaff-Reinet – named for the Governor of the Dutch Cape Colony|Governor of the Cape Colony Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff|Cornelius Jacob van de Graaff (in office: 1785–1791) and for his wife Hester Cornelia van de Graaff (née Reynet). Later, during the Napoleonic wars of 1803–1815, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain took control of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Colony (1806) and encouraged British citizens to migrate there as a means to boost the British population in the area.  From the early 1800s until the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Eastern Cape saw colonisation by British human migration|migrants. English settlers established most of the towns, naming them either for places in England or for the original founders. British colonisation saw schools, churches, hospitals, town centres and government buildings built to speed up development. Some of the older European settlements include: Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown (1812), Port Elizabeth (1820), Salem, Eastern Cape| Salem (1820), Bathurst, Eastern Cape| Bathurst (1820), East London, Eastern Cape|East London (1836), Paterson, Eastern Cape| Paterson (1879), Cradock, Eastern Cape| Cradock (1814) and King William's Town, Eastern Cape|King William's Town. == Demographics == The population of Eastern Cape Province is 6,562,053, of whom 86.3% are Bantu peoples of South Africa|Black, 8.3% are Coloureds, 4.7% are White South Africans|White and 0.4% are Indian South Africans|Indian/Asian. A large majority of people in the province are Xhosa people|Xhosa, with 78.8% of residents in Eastern Cape identifying as Xhosa as of 2011. Unlike most of South Africa the White South Africans|White population is overwhelmingly of British diaspora in Africa|British descent.  Roughly 90% of White South Africans in Eastern Cape are English-speakers of British diaspora in Africa|British descent while only about 10% of White South Africans|Whites in the province are of Boer/Afrikaner ancestry. Eastern Cape is one of only two provinces in South Africa where British diaspora in Africa|British descended Whites outnumber Boers/Afrikaners, the other being Kwazulu-Natal. Port Elizabeth is the largest city in Eastern Cape Province. == Notable people ==  ==Law and government==  The first premier was Raymond Mhlaba and the current premier is Oscar Mabuyane, both of the African National Congress. The province is served by the capital of Bhisho next to King William's Town. The parliament and other important government buildings are situated in the precinct. The High Court that is superior to all courts in the region is situated in Grahamstown and has local seats in Port Elizabeth, East London, and Bhisho. == Geography == image:ISS059-E-91096 - View of South Africa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The southern part of the province seen from International Space Station|space. Various mountain ranges in the Cape Fold Belt are visible, besides Cape Recife and Cape St. Francis.  The Eastern Cape gets progressively wetter from west to east. The west is mostly semiarid Karoo, except in the far south, which is temperate rainforest in the Tsitsikamma region. The coast is generally rugged with interspersed beaches. Most of the province is hilly to very mountainous between Graaff-Reinet and Rhodes including the Sneeuberge (English: Snow Mountains), Stormberg Mountains|Stormberge, Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberge and Drakensberg (English: Dragon Mountains). The highest point in the province is Ben Macdhui (South Africa)|Ben Macdhui at 3001 m. The east from East London, South Africa|East London and Komani, Eastern Cape|Queenstown towards the KwaZulu-Natal border – a region known previously as Transkei – is lush grassland on rolling hills, punctuated by deep gorges with intermittent forest. Eastern Cape has a coast on its east which lines southward, creating shores leading to the south Indian Ocean. In the northeast, it borders the following districts of Lesotho: *Mohale's Hoek District – west of Quthing *Quthing District – between Mohale and Qacha's Nek *Qacha's Nek District – east of Quthing Domestically, it borders the following provinces: *Western Cape – west *Northern Cape – northwest *Free State (South African province)|Free State – north *KwaZulu-Natal – far northeast  Climate is highly varied. The west is dry with sparse rain during winter or summer, with frosty winters and hot summers. The area Tsitsikamma to Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown receives more precipitation, which is also relatively evenly distributed and temperatures are mild. Further east, rainfall becomes more plentiful and humidity increases, becoming more subtropical along the coast with summer rainfall. The interior can become very cold in winter, with heavy snowfalls occasionally occurring in the mountainous regions between Molteno, Eastern Cape|Molteno and Rhodes, Eastern Cape|Rhodes. *Port Elizabeth|Gqeberha: Jan Max: 25&nbsp;°C, Min: 18&nbsp;°C; Jul Max: 20&nbsp;°C, Min: 9&nbsp;°C *Molteno, Eastern Cape|Molteno & Barkly East: Jan Max 28&nbsp;°C, Min 11&nbsp;°C; Jul Max: 14&nbsp;°C, Min: -7&nbsp;°C == Tourism == File:Aloe Ferox between Cofimvaba and Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|upright|"Aloe ferox" on the R61 route between Cofimvaba and Ngcobo.

The Eastern Cape offers a wide array of attractions, including  of untouched and pristine coastline along with beaches, and Big Five Game|big-five game viewing in a malaria-free environment. The Addo Elephant National Park, situated  from Port Elizabeth, was proclaimed in 1931. Its  offers sanctuary to 170 elephants, 400 Cape buffalo and 21 black rhino of the very scarce Kenyan sub-species. The province is the location of Tiffindell, South Africa's only snow skiing resort, which is situated near the hamlet of Rhodes, Eastern Cap ...
