During the Jin dynasty (266–420), when northern China was invaded by the barbarian tribes, many northerners (especially the aristocratic clans) moved to south China with the Jin court. It was during this period that the Huang clansmen migrated to Fujian. According to Min Shu 閩書 (Book of Min) (Quoted from Chung Yoon-Ngan): "During the second year (of the reign) of Yongjia (308AD) the Central Plain was in chaos and the eight clans:- Lin (surname)|Lin 林, Huang 黃, Chen (surname)|Chen 陳, Zheng (surname)|Zheng 鄭, Zhan (surname)|Zhan 詹, Qiū (surname)|Qiu 邱, He (surname)|He 何, and Hu (surname)|Hu 胡, entered Min 閩 (present day Fujian province, China)." From the Tang dynasty (618-907) onwards, many Han Chinese migrated from Fujian to Guangdong and the other southern provinces. Huang grew into a big clan in south China and it is the 3rd biggest surname in Southern China today. Migration to Taiwan began during the transition period from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) to Qing dynasty (1644–1912), when many Han Chinese followed the Anti-Manchu Ming loyalist forces under Zheng Chenggong, and crossed the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan island. Huang migration overseas began as early as the 14th century during the Ming dynasty to destinations in Southeast Asia. Migration to Americas began only in the mid-19th century following the forced opening of China's doors to the West. Huang is one of the largest Chinese surname clans in Americas today. The population of overseas Huang Clansmen was estimated at 2 million in 2000. The another surname "皇" has several origins: 1. The descendants of the Three Emperors of ancient China.  2.
