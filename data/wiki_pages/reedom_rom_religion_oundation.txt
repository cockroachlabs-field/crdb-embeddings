Formed in 1976, FFRF promotes the separation of church and state, and challenges the legitimacy of many federal and state programs that are faith-based. It supports groups such as nonreligious students and clergy who want to leave their faith. == History == File:Madison August 2022 057 (Freethought Hall).jpg|thumb|The Freedom From Religion Foundation's Freethought Hall in Madison, Wisconsin The FFRF was co-founded by Anne Nicol Gaylor and her daughter, Annie Laurie Gaylor, in 1976 and was incorporated nationally on April 15, 1978.""

In March 2011, FFRF, along with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, began The Clergy Project, a confidential on-line community that supports clergy as they leave their faith. In 2012, it gave its first Freedom From Religion Foundation and Clergy Project "Hardship Grant" to Jerry DeWitt, a former pastor who left the ministry to join the atheist movement. FFRF provides financial support to the Secular Student Alliance, an organization that has affiliate groups for nonreligious students on college campuses. In 2015, FFRF announced Nonbelief Relief, a related organization that obtained and later gave up its federal tax-exempt status. Nonbelief Relief was unsuccessful in a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service|IRS because it lacked standing to challenge the Form 990 exemption that applies to churches. Nonbelief Relief is a humanitarian agency for atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, and their supporters. Nonbelief Relief was created by the executive board of FFRF to remediate conditions of human suffering and injustice on a global scale, whether the result of natural disasters, human actions or adherence to religious dogma. == Media and publications == The FFRF publishes a newspaper, "Freethought Today", ten times a year. Since 2006, as the Freethought Radio Network, FFRF has produced the "Freethought Radio" show, an hour-long show broadcast live on WXXM-FM Saturdays at 11 a.m. CDT. It had also been broadcast on Air America Radio|Air America before that service ceased operation in March, 2010. The show is hosted by the co-presidents of FFRF, Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor. Regular features include "Theocracy Alert" and "Freethinkers Almanac". The latter highlights historic freethinkers, many of whom are also songwriters. The show's intro and outro make use of John Lennon's "Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine song". Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the FFRF, is the author of the nonfiction book on clergy pedophilia scandals "Betrayal of Trust: Clergy Abuse of Children" (out of print) and the editor of "Women Without Superstition: No Gods – No Masters" and the anthology "Woe to the Women". She edited the FFRF newspaper "Freethought Today" until July 2008. Her husband, Dan Barker, author of "Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist", "Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists", "The Good Atheist: Living a Purpose-Filled Life Without God", "Life Driven Purpose", "God: The Most Unpleasant Character in all Fiction", and "Just Pretend: A Freethought Book for Children", is a musician and songwriter, a former Pentecostal Christian minister, and co-president of FFRF. ==Litigation and issues==  =  In June 2004, the FFRF challenged the constitutionality of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships|White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The Foundation's complaint alleged that "the use of money appropriated by Congress under Taxing and Spending Clause|Article I, section 8, to fund conferences that various executive branch agencies hold to promote President Bush's 'White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships|Faith-Based and Community Initiatives conflicted with the First Amendment. The suit "contended that the defendant officials violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause by organizing national and regional conferences at which faith-based organizations allegedly 'are singled out as being particularly worthy of federal funding because of their religious orientation, and the belief in God is extolled as distinguishing the claimed effectiveness of faith-based social services. The FFRF also alleged that "the defendant officials 'engage in myriad activities, such as making public appearances and giving speeches, throughout the United States, intended to promote and advocate for funding for faith-based organizations." The FFRF further asserted, "Congressional appropriations  used to support the activities of the defendants." In 2007 the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that taxpayers do not have the right to challenge the constitutionality of expenditures made by the executive branch. In May 2007, the FFRF, on behalf of Indiana taxpayers, challenged the creation of a chaplaincy pilot program for the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA). The FSSA hired Pastor Michael L. Latham, a Baptist minister, in 2006, at a salary of $60,000 a year. In September 2007, in response to the FFRF's suit, Indiana ended the program. = In April 2003, the FFRF, on behalf of Montana residents, sued the Montana Office of Rural Health and its executive director David M. Young along with the Montana State University|Montana State University-Bozeman and the Montana Faith-Health Cooperative. It was  ...
