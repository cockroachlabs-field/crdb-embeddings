   {|  |variants with their own articles = }} |} The "Eurocopter Tiger" is a four-blade, twin-engine attack helicopter which first entered service in 2003. It is manufactured by Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter), which arose from the merger of Aérospatiale's and DASA's respective helicopter divisions. Airbus Helicopters designates it as the "EC665". In France and Spain, the Tiger is known as the "Tigre" (which is French and Spanish for Tiger), while in Germany it is referred to as the "Tiger". Development of the Tiger started during the Cold War, and it was initially intended as an anti-tank warfare|anti-tank helicopter platform to be used against a Soviet ground invasion of Western Europe. During its prolonged development period the Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed, changing the European security situation. France and Germany chose to proceed with the Tiger, developing it instead as a multirole attack helicopter. It achieved operational readiness in 2008. The Tiger has the distinction of being the first all-composite helicopter developed in Europe; even the earliest models also incorporate other advanced features such as a glass cockpit, stealth technology, and high agility to increase its survivability. Improved variants have since entered service, outfitted with more powerful engines and compatible with a wider range of weapons. Since entering service, Tigers have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, and Mali. ==Development==  In 1984, the French and West German governments issued a requirement for an advanced antitank helicopter, with one variant desired by the French dedicated to the escort and antihelicopter role.  As originally planned, both countries would procure a total of 427 helicopters. The West Germans planned on acquiring 212 models of the anti-tank variant named PAH-2 ("Panzerabwehrhubschrauber" or "Anti-tank helicopter"), with deliveries starting at the end of 1992. The French wanted 75 HAPs ("Hélicoptère d'Appui Protection" or "Support and Escort Helicopter") and 140 HACs ("Hélicoptère Anti Char" or "Anti Tank Helicopter"), with deliveries starting at the end of 1991 and 1995, respectively. A joint venture consisting of Aérospatiale and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB was subsequently chosen as the preferred supplier. In 1986, the development programme was effectively canceled due to spiraling costs; it had been officially calculated that supplying the German forces with an equivalent number of US-produced Boeing AH-64 Apache|McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache attack helicopters would have been a considerably cheaper alternative to proceeding with the development of the Tiger.Krotz 2001, p. 130. According to statements by the French Defence Minister André Giraud in April 1986, the collaborative effort had become more expensive than an individual national programme and was also forecast to take longer to complete. In July 1986, a government report into the project alleged that development had become distanced from the requirements and preferences of its military customers. France and Germany reorganised the programme, including steps such as the adoption of fixed-term contracts which placed greater financial risk upon the private firms involved. Thomson-CSF|Thomson CSF also took over the majority of Tiger's electronic development work, such as the visual systems and sensors. Despite the early development problems and the political uncertainty between 1984 and 1986, the program was formally relaunched in November 1987; it was at this point that a greater emphasis on the attack helicopter's Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank capabilities came about.Krotz 2011, p. 131. Much of the project's organisational framework was rapidly redeveloped between 1987 and 1989; such as the installation of a Franco-German Helicopter Office to act as a program executive agency in May 1989.Krotz 2011, p. 133. File:TigerUHT1.jpg|thumb|left|German Army Tiger UHT In November 1989, Eurocopter signed an agreement that financially secured the majority of the helicopter's development through to serial production, including arrangements for two assembly lines to be built at Aerospatiale's Marignane plant and MBB's Donauwörth facility. This same arrangement also included the manufacture of five Tiger prototypes. Three were to operate as unarmed testbeds and the other two as armed combat prototypes with one for the French escort helicopter variant and the other for the German anti-tank variant. The first prototype took the Tiger's maiden flight on 27 April 1991 that lasted for 30 minutes.Krotz 2011, p. 134. Due to the end of the Cold War and subsequent defence budgets decreases in the 1990s, financial pressures led to further questions regarding the necessity for the entire program; in 1992 there was speculation that the German Defence Ministry might not continue with the project due to the requirement to make fiscal cutbacks.Krotz 2011, pp. 132, 136. However, Germany was also increasingly keen for the Tiger to perform a wider assortment of missions; beyond being an excellent anti-tank platform, the specifications for the German platform were modified to include armed battlefield reconnaissance, close air support of ground troops, and escorting other helicopters.Krotz 2011, pp. 134, 136. In 1992, Aérospatiale and MBB, among other companies, merged to form the Eurocopter Group; this led to considerable consolidation of the aerospace industry and the Tiger project itself.Krotz 2011, pp. 133–135. A major agreement was struck in December 1996 between France and Germany that cemented the Tiger's prospects and committed the development of supporting elements, such as a series of new generation missile designs for use by the new helicopter.Krotz 2011, p. 147. National political issues continued to affect the prospects of the Tiger, however. A proposed sale of up to 145 Tigers to Turkey proved a source of controversy; Turkey selected the Tiger as the preferred option, but conflicting attitudes between Eurocopter, France, and Germany in regards to military exports led to Turkey withdrawing its interest.Krotz 2011, pp. 149, 151. On 18 June 1999, Germany and France publicly placed orders for an initial batch of 160 Tiger helicopters, 80 for each nation, valued at €3.3&nbsp;billion.Krotz 2011, pp. 132, 149. On 22 March 2002, the first production Tiger was rolled out in a large ceremony held at Eurocopter's Donauwörth factory; although production models began initial acceptance trials in 2003, the first official delivery to the French Army took place on 18 March 2005; the first official Tiger delivery to Germany followed on 6 April 2005.Krotz 2011, p. 154. Germany reduced its order to 57 in March 2013. . Flightglobal.com, 18 March 2013. In 2008 OCCAR estimated the project cost at .Tran, Pierre.  "Defense News", 29 January 2013. France's FY2013 budget put their share of the project at €6.4bn (~US$8.7bn), implying a programme cost of €14.7bn (~US$20.1bn) to the three main partners. The 2013 French White Paper changed the mix to 60 HAP and 20 of the more expensive HAD; at FY2013 prices, their HAP cost €27.4m/unit (~US$37m) and their HAD €36.1m/unit (~US$49m), including development costs the French Tigers cost €80m (~US$109m) each. In December 2015, France placed an additional order for 7 HAD helicopters, with the plan to upgrade the entire fleet to the HAD standard by 2025 for a total of 67 helicopters.  During the 1990s, export prospects for the Tiger had been invigorated by two large bids for orders from Britain and the Netherlands.Krotz 2011, p. 132. Discreet talks between Britain and France regarding an association with the Tiger had been continuing since the late 1980s and, although Britain had initially dismissed industrial participation in the project, it was known by the mid 1990s that Britain was prepared to purchase modern attack helicopters from abroad.Krotz 2011, p. 138. Eurocopter's management was keen to press production of the Tiger into action as soon as possible, as uncertainty over the date at which production, and therefore availability, would start was viewed as negatively impacting potential export deals. In both the Netherlands and Britain, a considerable amount of lobbying pressure was applied in the hopes of the Tiger's selection.Krotz 2011, pp. 138–139. However, neither country would order the Tiger.Krotz 2011, pp. 139–140. File:Australian Army (A38-017) Eurocopter Tiger ARH display at the 2015 Australian International Airshow.jpg|thumb|right|An Australian Army Tiger in 2015 On 21 December 2001, Eurocopter was awarded the contract to meet the Australian Army's "AIR 87 requirement" for 22 Tiger helicopters of the ARH (Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter) version. Modifications from the standard Tiger included new communications and avionics systems, as well as compatibility with Australian safety requirements.Krotz 2011, p. 151. Per the contract's terms, 18 of the 22 aircraft were assembled at Australian Aerospace's Brisbane facility, a subsidiary of Eurocopter.Krotz 2011, pp. 151–152. On 1 July 2007, because of delays in attaining operational capability, Australia's Defence Materiel Organisation stopped all payments in regards to the procurement. According to Australia's Department of Defence, by 2008 the main issues had been addressed and payments resumed accordingly. . Australian Department of Defence. Retrieved: 18 October 2009. In October 2010, it was revealed that the helicopters will not be fully operational for another two years. In December 2011, the final Tiger ARH was delivered to the Australian Army. In August 2019, Australia announced LAND 4503, the Tiger ARH replacement program. In September 2003, Spain selected a variant of the Tiger HAP combat support helicopter – the Tiger HAD – for its army. The 24 helicopters of this type would be armed with the PARS 3 LR and Mistral missile systems, and feature uprated Enhanced MTR390 engines capable of lifting heavier payloads.Krotz 2011, pp. 152–153. Deliveries of the HAD variant began in 2007.{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/Since80s/h_aetg.php |title=Eurocopter Tiger |publisher=Helis.com |access-date=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web ...
