  The  www.hongwontack.pe.kr/homepage4/data/450815.pdfwere kings of ancient Japan who sent envoys to China during the 5th century to strengthen the legitimacy of their claims to power by gaining the recognition of the Chinese emperor. Details about them are unknown. According to written records in China, their names were San of Wa|San (|l=Laudable}}), Chin of Wa|Chin (|l=Precious}}), Sai of Wa|Sai (|l=Helpful}}), Ko of Wa|Kō (|l=Prosperous}}) and Bu of Wa|Bu (|l=Martial}}). == Titles bestowed on the Kings of Wa == In general, five kings of Wa were bestowed the titles  ("Antō Dai-Shōgun, Wa-kokuō", Grand General of Antō, King of Wa). In the Southern Dynasties of China in this period, there were three ranks of General titles which were bestowed to the chiefs of the subject state (located in the East of China) who sent envoy to the emperor of the Dynasty. The highest general title was  ("Seitō Dai-Shōgun", Grand General conquering the East). The next high title was  ("Chintō Dai-Shōgun", Grand General appeasing the East).　The third high title and the lowest among three was  ("Antō Dai-Shōgun", Grand General pacifying the East).  In the Liu Song Dynasty|Song dynasty, the emperor bestowed  ("Grand General conquering the East") on the King of Goguryeo, and  ("Grand General appeasing the East") on the King of Baekje. However, the Song Emperor bestowed the third general title,  ("Grand General pacifying the East") on the King of Wa. There are interpretations on this fact that the King of Goguryeo stood in the highest rank, and the King of Wa stood in the lowest rank, while the King of Baekje stood between Goguryeo and Wa.Ishii 2005, p.169 But there are also other opinions against this interpretation. The difference of general ranks among the three states (Goguryo, Baekje, and Wa) was due to the order which each state had first sent envoy to the dynasty, and it cannot be said that the ranks of Goguryeo and Baekje were substantially higher than that of Wa.Ishii 2005, p.175 Sakamoto also points out the different view on these general titles.(ja) 坂元義種 『倭の五王』教育社、1981年9月、180頁。. == Chinese records and the bestowed titles on the kings of Wa == {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !

Most contemporary historians assign the five Japanese kings to the following emperors (two possibilities are identified for the Kings San and Chin), mostly based on the individual features of their genealogies reported in the Chinese sources. On the other hand, archeological evidence, such as the  inscriptions on the Inariyama Sword|Inariyama and Eta Funayama Sword, also supports the idea that Bu is an equivalent of Emperor Yūryaku, who was called "Wakatakeru Ōkimi" by his contemporaries. *San  : Emperor Nintoku or Emperor Richū *Chin : Emperor Hanzei or Emperor Nintoku *Sai  : Emperor Ingyō *Kō   : Emperor Ankō *Bu   : Emperor Yūryaku Since Bu is most likely to be Yūryaku, Kō, who is said to be Bu's older brother, is likely to be an equivalent of Ankō, who is also noted in the "Nihonshoki" as an elder brother to Yūryaku. However, the "Book of Song" records Kō as ""Crown Prince" Kō"; there is a possibility that he is not Ankō, but rather Prince Kinashi no Karu, who was a crown prince of Ingyō. == Meanings of titles bestowed on the kings of Wa == In the age of the Liu Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty and the Southern Dynasties, there were various titles for high officials and military lords of the empire. These titles were also bestowed on the Monarch of the subject States in the Tributary system of China|Sakuhō System. King of Wa was generally bestowed the two titles, "(Grand) General Antō" (, "Antō (Dai) Shōgun") and "King of Wa" (, "Wa-Kokuō"). Some Kings of Wa, such as King Chin or King Bu, asked the more strong and higher rank Titles. The Emperor of Chinese Dynasty bestowed some of them, but not approved every titles required. King Chin asked the titles ”" ("Shijisetsu, Totoku, Wa, Baekje, Silla, Mimana, Shinkan, Bokan, Rokkoku-Shogunji, Antō-Shōgun, Wa-Kokuō"). This contains the Five Titles. # , "Shijisetsu" : Highest Rank Military Commander (General)(ja)  (Retrieved 2023-0209) "Shijisetsu", the next higher rank was  "Jisetsu", the lowest rank was  "Kasetsu".  "setsu" is a small wand indicating that emperor gave the  formal mission to one who holds it.}} # , "Totoku" : Military Governor(ja)  (Retrieved 2023-0209) # , "Totoku - Region - Shogunji" : Governor/Commander ruling all the military matters of the said Region (Region, State, Province, etc.) # , "Antō Dai-Shōgun" : Grand General of Antō (Grand General pacifying the East) # , "Wa-Kokuō" : King of Wa State Therefore, ”" means 1) Highest Rank Military General, 2) Governor ruling all the military matters of the Six States - Wa, Baekje, Silla, Mimana, Shinkan and Bokan, 3) Grand General pacifying the East, 4) King of Wa. The Song dynasty did not approve the Title of  ("Totoku - Baekje - Shogunji"). The Song dynasty did not approve that King Chin would hold the power of militarily ruling the State area of Baekje. (King Bu also asked this power - militarily ruling the Baekje State -, but the Song did no approve as well.)坂元義種「巻頭史論 研究史 古代の日本と朝鮮--「七支刀」「好太王碑」「倭の五王」研究の成果と課題」『歴史読本』第51巻第3号、新人物往来社、2006年2月、 58-59頁 King Bu asked the Title  ("Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi"), but the Emperor of Song dynasty did not approve, and instead bestowed the Titles "" ("Shijisetsu, Totoku, Wa, Silla, Mimana, Kara, Shinkan, Bokan, Rokkoku-Shogunji, Antō-Shōgun, Wa-Kokuō").
