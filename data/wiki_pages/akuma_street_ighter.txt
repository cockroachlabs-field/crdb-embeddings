Akuma made his debut in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" as a Player character|secret character and Boss (video games)|boss. In the storyline of the "Street Fighter" video games, he is the younger brother of Gouken, Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu's and Ken Masters|Ken's master. In some games, he also has an alternate character|alternate version named "Shin Akuma" or  in Japanese and Oni Akuma in "Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition". Since his debut, Akuma has appeared in several subsequent titles and has been well-received by both fans and critics. ==Creation== Akuma was created by request of Noritaka Funamizu to Akira Yasuda when creating a new "Street Fighter" character. Akuma was designed in order to please fans who were victims of April's Fools in the claims from journalists that there was a hidden character named Sheng Long. Funamizu wanted the character, Akuma, to be based on Ryu's design. While still being an evil character, Yasuda still wanted to create a major contrast between the regular boss, M. Bison and Akuma. Akuma has dark red hair, dark skin tone, glowing red eyes with black sclera, wears prayer beads around his neck, a dark gray karate gi and a piece of twine around his waist in lieu of an obi (sash)|obi. The kanji "ten" (天) — meaning "Heaven" — can be seen on his back when it appears during certain win animations. Shin Akuma's appearance is very similar to Akuma's; for example, in the "Street Fighter Alpha" series, Shin Akuma had a purple karate gi instead of a dark gray one and marginally darker skin tone. Akuma's introduction in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" stemmed from the development team's desire to introduce a "mysterious and really powerful" character, with his status as a hidden character within the game resulting from later discussions. When asked regarding the presence of Akuma as a secret character in several of Capcom's fighting games, Capcom's Noritaka Funamizu stated that, while he did not personally support the concept, he said, "Akuma is a character that can fit in any game design nicely". Matt Edwards of Capcom Europe considered Akuma the most powerful "Street Fighter" character. Rich Knight of "Complex (magazine)|Complex" described Akuma as "a character who must constantly be on the offense, because he takes a shit ton of damage when he's not." Akuma's appearance remained consistent until "Street Fighter V" where his hair reaches far longer and has grown around his face, like a lion's mane. Takayuki Nakayama explained that the staff considered multiple designs that were scrapped such as a shirtless look, multiple scars within the body, one with a broken shirt and one where he carried a baby. ==Appearances==   Akuma made his debut in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", the fifth arcade iteration of the "Street Fighter II" games, where he appears as a Secret characters|hidden and unnamed character. After meeting certain requirements, Akuma appears prior to the player's final match with M. Bison and obliterates M. Bison before challenging the player. In the Japanese arcade version of the game, Akuma would introduce himself to the player before the match, proclaiming himself to be the . He also has two endings in the game as well: one for defeating M. Bison and another against himself. While the dialogue in these endings was omitted from the international releases of the arcade game, they were edited into one ending and included in the English localization of "Super Street Fighter II Turbo|Super Turbo Revival" for the Game Boy Advance. Shin Akuma is, however, an unlockable playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, "Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival", as well as the Japan-only Dreamcast version of the game, "Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service". In the latter version, another version of Akuma referred to as "Tien Gouki" can also be selected. Akuma appears in "Street Fighter Alpha|Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams", where he was given his name, once again as a hidden opponent and unlockable character. His backstory remains the same as in "Super Turbo". Akuma was added to the immediate roster in "Street Fighter Alpha 2" and "Street Fighter Alpha 3", with a powered-up version of the character named "Shin Akuma" appearing as a hidden opponent. The character's relation with other "Street Fighter" characters begins to be fleshed out, establishing rivalries with Guy (Final Fight)|Guy, List of Street Fighter characters#Adon|Adon, Gen (Street Fighter)|Gen and Ryu. Shin Akuma, rather than "Final Bison", is Evil Ryu's final boss in the console versions of "Street Fighter Alpha 3". Akuma and Shin Akuma are featured in "Street Fighter EX" as hidden boss characters, where he is one of the few characters able to move out of the 2D playing field, during his teleport. Akuma also appears in the arcade and home video game console adaption of "Street Fighter: The Movie (arcade game)|Street Fighter: The Movie" despite not appearing in the movie. Image:Oni (SSFIVAE).jpg|thumb|upright|Oni in "Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition"|alt= Akuma is featured in the "Street Fighter III" sub-series beginning with "Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact|Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant Attack". Like in his debut in "Super Turbo", Akuma is both a secret opponent who serves as an alternate final boss and an unlockable character, with the CPU-controlled version being the "Shin Akuma" incarnation introduced in "Alpha 2". He is a regular character in "Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike|Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future". Akuma reappears in "Street Fighter IV", being one of the main antagonists and once again a secret boss in the Arcade Mode as well as an unlockable character in both console versions. A new form of Akuma, known as , was confirmed in Super Street Fighter IV#Arcade Edition|" Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition" by leaked videos.  Unlike Shin Akuma, Oni is the being that would consume Akuma after transcending all of his humanity and mastering the Satsui no Hado. Akuma returns in "Street Fighter V" as a downloadable character.  Akuma has appeared in some form or another through many Capcom games outside the "Street Fighter" franchise. The first of these appearances was in the fighting game "X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom", where Akuma (in his "Super Turbo" incarnation) appears as a nameless hidden character. He would appear in the later Marvel Comics|Marvel-licensed fighting games (see "Marvel vs. Capcom" series). In "X-Men vs. Street Fighter", he is a regular character but–in a nod to his hidden character status in other games–his select box is hidden. In "Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter", he appears both as a selectable character and as ""Cyber Akuma"" (""Mech Gouki"" in Japan), a cyborg|mechanized version enhanced by Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse acting as the horseman of Death and the final boss. He is absent from "Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes"; in his stead, Ryu has a Hyper Combo that changes his fighting style to incorporate Akuma's moveset. He reappears as a playable character in the sequels: "Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes", "Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds" and "Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3". In the "SNK vs. Capcom" series, Akuma appears in "SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium" as an unlockable character and in "Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000" as a Ratio 4 character. He also appears in "Capcom vs. SNK 2" and "SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos" as both regular Akuma and Shin Akuma. In "Capcom vs. SNK 2", a different form of Shin Akuma appears. This form of Akuma achieves a new level of power when a dying Rugal Bernstein pours his Orochi power into him. His name is spelled in Japanese as , with the "Shin" character meaning "God" instead of the usual "True". Also, various version of Akuma have appeared in the "SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash" series. Akuma appears as a special guest character in "Tekken 7". In the game's story, he seeks to repay a debt to List of Tekken characters#Kazumi Mishima/Devil Kazumi|Kazumi Mishima for saving his life from an unknown critical situation, who asks him to kill her husband Heihachi Mishima|Heihachi and his son Kazuya Mishima|Kazuya for her if she dies. When Heihachi is finally dead for good at the hands of Kazuya, he is Akuma's only target left. Similar to his appearances in the "Street Fighter" series, Akuma replaces Kazumi as a secret arcade mode final boss if certain conditions are met. Akuma was originally planned to be the only guest character for "Tekken 7", due to Katsuhiro Harada and Michael Murray saying they both don't really like the guest characters because it throws off the "Tekken" world and setting. However, Murray also explained that Akuma was a great fit and that there is a chance for more guests in the future. "Tekken 7" started getting three more guest characters: Geese Howard from SNK's "Fatal Fury" fighting game series in November 2017, Noctis Lucis Caelum from "Final Fantasy XV" in March 2018, and Negan|Negan Smith from "The Walking Dead (franchise)|The Walking Dead" in February 2019. Akuma also appears as an unlockable guest character on "Tekken Mobile". He also appears in "Namco × Capcom". He appears as both a playable character and one of the final boss characters in the crossover fighting game "Street Fighter X Tekken". Akuma also appears in the fighting video game "Street Fighter X Mega Man", as a hidden boss. Akuma also appears in "Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo" as the final boss, "Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix" (known as "Pocket Fighter" in Japan) as an unlockable character, and in the Japanese console version of "Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness" as a mecha named "Zero Gouki". He is featured in a DLC episode of the action video game "Asura's Wrath", alongside Ryu as an opponent.{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/28/asuras-wrath-dlc-details-2|title=Asura's Wrath DLC Details|last=Krupa|first=Daniel|date=March 28, 2012|work=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|access-date ...
