She is often admired for her generosity and charity. The name "Ulrike" is a Danish language|Danish version of the name; in Swedish language|Swedish she is called "Ulrika Eleonora den äldre" (English: "Ulrica Eleanor the Elder"), to distinguish her from her daughter, the future queen regnant. ==Life==  File:Pierre Signac - Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark - Royal Collection.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ulrika Eleonora in her youth. portrayed by Pierre Signac Ulrika Eleonora was the daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III of Denmark-Norway and his spouse,  Queen Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was given a strict upbringing under the supervision of her mother: she was taught several different languages, and was reportedly a good student in drawing and painting.Ulrikke Eleonore af Danmark i C.F Bricka, Dansk biografidk Lexikon (1. udgrave, 1904)  In 1675 she was betrothed to King Charles XI of Sweden. The purpose of the match, though from the Swedish viewpoint, was to prevent Denmark from forming an alliance with the enemies of Sweden.Ulrikke Eleonore af Danmark i C.F. Bricka, Dansk biografisk Lexikon (1. udgave, 1904) Her brother, the King of Denmark-Norway, was not enthusiastic about the match, but he left the decision to her mother, who was very eager to complete it because it would give Ulrika the status of queen.Ulrikke Eleonore af Danmark i C.F. Bricka, Dansk biografisk Lexikon (1. udgave, 1904) The engagement was announced 13 July 1675. During the Scanian War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden in 1675–1679 she was encouraged to break the engagement. Her brother broke it for her in 1676, but she herself continued to regard herself engaged. She was considered as a possible bride by the Prince of Orange in 1676 and then by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, but she refused a different match. During the war, she gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry and her engagement ring to buy food, ose, and medicine for the Swedish prisoners of war. She also refused to participate in the celebrations arranged in honor of Danish victories over Sweden. During the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark-Norway in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was again on the agenda, and was ratified on 26 September 1679. The marriage contract was signed 6 February 1680, and when the Swedish representative Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna returned to Sweden, he escorted her to Sweden on his return home. During one of the celebrations in honor of her marriage, her name and the name of her groom were written with fireworks. One of the spectators pointed out that the person whose name died out first was the one who was going to die first. When her name went out first, she stated that she hoped it would truly be so, for she could not bear to outlive her spouse.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. Ulrika Eleonora was popular in Denmark due to her charity. When she left for Sweden, her brother Christian V made his farewell at Frederiksborg, during which he gave her back the jewels she had pawned in favor of the Swedish prisoners of war, including her engagement ring. When she made her farewell to him, she said that she did not think she would ever see him again, but: "as I am now regarded a pawn of peace between Denmark and Sweden, I ask God for the grace to fulfill such a glorious commitment; so that my behavior may contribute to eradicate all hostility between these two people and instead forever unite them in friendship."Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. In Helsingør, where she said her farewell to her mother and sisters, she thanked the Danes for their farewell greetings with the words:  :"Thank you! By my heart I thank you! May I ever be remembered in Denmark with the same tenderness, and may God give me the grace to live such, that I by the last separation  can be followed by the same love from my subjects!"Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). "Hedvig Eleonora." Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish).  File:Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden Ehrenstrahl 1686.jpg|thumb|250px|Ulrika Eleonora, by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl 1686 Ulrika Eleonora arrived in Helsingborg in Sweden on 4 May 1680, where she was welcomed by canon salutation, the Queen Dowager, the Swedish court and the local aristocracy. Two days later she met and married Charles at Skottorp Manor on 6 May 1680. The wedding was hasty and a relatively simple affair in the presence of a small circle of courtiers.  The reasoning for this was that the King, who was at that time in a tense relationship with France, wished to avoid the presence of the French ambassador Feuqiéres, and could do so only if the time and place of the ceremony could be kept secret long enough for it to be impossible for the ambassador to attend.  The ceremony was to officially take place in Halmstad, and Ulrika Eleonora was only to spend the night at Skottorp on her way there, but when she arrived she was hastily married instead. On 25 November 1680 she was crowned Queen at Storkyrkan in Stockholm. Initially, Charles XI was disappointed in her appearance and asked Johan Gyllenstierna if he could not have been chosen a more beautiful consort, upon which he was given the reply: "Your Majesty will see, that within her there is an angel".Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). "Hedvig Eleonora." Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish).  Ulrika Eleonora was described as religious, patient, mild and charitable, moderately beautiful and with a simple dignity. She was received with enthusiasm among the public, because she was seen as a hope and a symbol of lasting peace. Her popularity was increased by her personal merits.  She made a favorable impression of courage before her arrival to Stockholm, when spent some time in the royal residences outside of the city awaiting her official enter in the capital and the coronation. Traveling on Mälaren between Köping and Kungsör, the boat Carolus hit a rock and almost sunk. On this occasion, she calmed the panic by saying: "Be still, do not cry out so! If we shall die, it will be the will of God, and God's will be done!" Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). "Hedvig Eleonora." Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish). Ulrika Eleonora also quickly made herself popular by immediately dispatching almost her entire Danish entourage back to Denmark, stating that she no longer needed anything from Denmark and that her spouse and his ministers would provide for her. Charles XI had provided her with her own court and a large allowance from her dower estates. The Danish ambassador Jens Juel (diplomat)|Jens Juel, who had been sent to secure her personal interests, protested against her insistence to refuse anything which could be to her advantage. She did accept being given her own court, though she commented that she would have been happy to merely share the household of the King, but she herself took the initiative of giving up the right to control her own economy, and giving up the administration of her dower to the officials of the monarch. When Juel protested that she went much too far in her eagerness to show herself submissive, and that she was giving away her own right to independence, she answered: "As I wish for nothing else than what is right and proper, the King and his officials would never be able to refuse what I ask of them without damaging their own name. Furthermore I hope that this indulgence of mine would ease the further negotiations with Denmark",Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna.  and to this Juel could not protest. File:Selfportrait (Drottning Ulrika Eleonora d.ä.) - Nationalmuseum - 24027.tif|thumb|Self portrait of and by the queen herself At the royal court, Ulrika Eleonora was placed in the shadow of her mother-in-law. While distrust between Denmark-Norway and Sweden caused by the Scanian War lingered, Hedvig Eleonora and the government of Sweden were not receptive to the son's idea to marry a Danish princess. Though his marriage was described as happy, Charles XI continued to place his mother before his wife. The mother-in-law of Ulrika Eleonora never quite surrendered the position of queen to her daughter-in-law. Upon the arrival of Ulrika Eleonora in Helsingborg, her mother-in-law offered her the most prominent place in the carriage on their departure from the harbor, but Ulrika Eleonora had instead insisted upon taking the most humble place. After this, her mother-in-law continued to monopolize the foremost place in rank at all occasions, such as placing herself by the side of King Charles XI at the table and receptions, and walking by his side in procession, leaving the second best place to Ulrika Eleonora.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. The King himself, being accustomed always to treat his mother with obedience and respect, adjusted himself to this.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. The King always referred to Ulrika Eleonora as "My Wife" and to his mother as "The Queen"; he paid his respect to his mother first and to his wife secondly.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. Mindful of this, the foreign ambassadors always visited Hedvig Eleonora first, and then Ulrika Eleonora when paying their respects to the royal family.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. This was nurtured by the circles at court who favored the alliance between Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp against Denmark-Norway, and pointed to the fact that in Denmark, the mother of Ulrika Eleonora, also placed herself before that of her daughter-in-law, and also that Hedvig Eleonora was not only Queen Dowager but also formerly regent.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna.     This created some tension between her and her mother-in-law, but there was never an open conflict.Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). "Hedvig Eleonora." Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish). However, in July 1686, Ulrika Eleonora left Stockholm when Charles XI was visiting the country, and took upon residence at the Uppsala Castle in Uppsala with the royal children and her own court, stating that she would be there not only for the summer. The reason was in fact to have been her displeasure over the relationship between her husband and mother-in-law.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. Meanwhile, her husband traveled around the country with his mother. In August, they visited her and unsuccessfully tried to convince her to return to Stockholm.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. After a visit by her mother-in-law alone in September, she finally returned. Later that year, she contacted the bishop Samuel Wiraenius and asked him to act as a mediator, and to make the King state officially what mistakes she could have made.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. Nothing more is known about this conflict, however, Ulrika Eleonora did accept that the rank of her mother-in-law was placed before her, but stated that she disliked that this meant that also her courtiers were ranked beneath those of her mother-in-law.Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19. Karl den elftes historia. H. 5. Karl den elfte och hans samtida av konungahuset och af högadels- och råds-partierna. Her private family life with her spouse and children were described as happy: her consort was never unfaithful to her. Upon his own deathbed in 1697, he told his mother that he had not been happy since his wife died. During her lifetime, Ulrika Eleonora never developed good terms with her mother-in-law, whom she once referred to as "The Devil of my marriage".Anders Fryxell, Otto Sjögren: Berättelser ur svenska historien / 19.

In 1688, she had plans to visit her family in Denmark, but her weak health forced her to abandon the idea.  At the summer residence Karlberg Palace, she enjoyed a happy family life away from the court and developed an interest in painting.  She was interested in theater and dance and acted as patron of the amateur theatre at court.  In the winter of 1683–84, a group of female courtiers performed the Swedish premier of "Iphigénie" by Jean Racine|Racine at court upon her request.  In the play, Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie acted in the part of "Iphigenie", Amalia Königsmarck as "Achilles", Aurora Königsma ...
