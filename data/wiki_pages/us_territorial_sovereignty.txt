 In the United States, a territory is any extent of region under the sovereignty|sovereign jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States, including all waters (around islands or continental tracts). The United States asserts sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing its territory. This extent of territory (country subdivision)|territory is all the area belonging to, and under the dominion of, the United States federal government (which includes tracts lying at a distance from the country) for administrative and other purposes. The United States total territory includes a subset of political divisions of the United States|political divisions. ==Territory of the United States== The United States' territory includes any geography under the control of the United States Federal government of the United States|federal government. Various regions, districts, and Division (political geography)|divisions are under the supervision of the United States federal government. The United States' territory includes clearly defined geographical area and refers to an area of land, air, or sea under jurisdiction of United States federal governmental authority (but is not limited only to these areas). The extent of territory is all the area belonging to, and under the dominion of, the United States of America federal government (which includes Lot (real estate)|tracts lying at a distance from the country) for Public administration|administrative and other purposes.  File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|Original copy of the Constitution. Under Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, a territory is subject to and belongs to the United States (but not necessarily within the national boundaries or any individual state). This includes tracts of land or water not included within the limits of any State and not admitted as a State into the Union. The Constitution of the United States states:   Congress possesses power to set territorial governments within the boundaries of the United States, under Article Four of the United States Constitution#Section 3: New states and federal property|Article 4, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. The first exercise of this power was the Northwest Ordinance of 1789. The power of Congress over such territory is political authority|exclusive and political authority|universal, including the creation of political divisions, except as delegated to a territory's government by act of Congress.  All territory under the control of the federal government is considered part of the "United States" for purposes of law.See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(36) and 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(38) Providing the term "State" and "United States" definitions on the U.S. Federal Code, Immigration and Nationality Act.   From 1901 to 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of opinions known as the Insular Cases held that the Constitution extended "ex proprio vigore" to the territories.  However, the Court in these cases also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation.  Under the same, the Constitution only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Territory of Alaska|Alaska and Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii, whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines... A United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court ruling from 1945 stated that the term "United States" can have three different meanings, in different contexts: }}  The United States Department of the Interior is charged with managing federal affairs within U.S. territory. The Interior Department has a wide range of responsibilities (which include the regulation of territorial governments and the basic stewardship for public lands, et al.). The United States Department of the Interior is not responsible for local government or for civil administration except in the cases of Indian reservations, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as those territories administered through the Office of Insular Affairs.  The exception is the "incorporated and unorganized" (see below) Palmyra Atoll|United States Territory of Palmyra Island, the legal remnant of the former Territory of Hawaii|United States Territory of Hawaii since 1959, in which the local government and civil administration were assigned by the United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior to the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2001.Secretary of the Interior Order No. 3224, January 18, 2001. ==United States divisions==   The contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Alaska are Political divisions of the United States|divided into smaller administrative regions.  These are called County (United States)|counties in 48 of the 50 states, borough (Alaska)|boroughs in Alaska and parish (Louisiana)|parishes in Louisiana. A county can include a number of city|cities and Town#United States|towns, or just a portion of either type. These counties have varying degrees of political and legal significance. A township (U.S.)|township in the United States refers to a small geographic area. The term is used in two ways: a survey township is simply a geographic reference used to define property location for deeds and grants; a civil township is a unit of local government, originally rural in application. The Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia and territories are under the direct authority of Congress, although each is allowed home rule. The United States government, rather than individual states or territories, conducts Foreign policy|foreign relations under the U.S. Constitution. Federal enclaves, such as domestic military bases and national parks, are administered directly by the federal government.  To varying degrees, the federal government exercises concurrent jurisdiction with the states where federal land is part of the territory previously granted to a state.   At times, territories are organized with a separate legislature, under a territorial governor and officers, appointed by the President and approved by the Senate of the United States. A territory has been historically divided into organized territory|organized territories and Territories of the United States#Orangized vs. unorganized territories|unorganized territories. An unorganized territory was generally either unpopulated or set aside for Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans and other indigenous peoples in the United States by the U.S. federal government, until such time as the growing and restless population encroached into the areas. In recent times, "unorganized" refers to the degree of self-governmental authority exercised by the territory. As a result of several U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court cases after the Spanish–American War, the United States had to determine how to deal with its newly acquired territories, such as the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam,Paul Carano and Pedro C. Sanchez, A Complete History of Guam (Rutland, VT: C. E. Tuttle, 1964)Howard P. Willens and Dirk Ballendorf, The Secret Guam Study: How President Ford's 1975 Approval of Commonwealth Was Blocked by Federal Officials (Mangilao, Guam: Micronesian Area Research Center; Saipan: Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Division of Historical Preservation, 2004) Wake Island, and other areas that were not part of the North American continent and which were not necessarily intended to become a part of the Union of States. As a consequence of the Supreme Court decisions, the United States has since made a distinction between incorporated territory|incorporated and unincorporated territory|unincorporated territories. regarding the distinction between incorporated and unincorporated territories regarding application of U.S. law to organized but unincorporated territories regarding application of U.S. law to unorganized unincorporated territories In essence, an incorporated territory is land that has been irrevocably incorporated within the sovereignty of the United States and to which the full corpus of the U.S. Constitution applies. An unincorporated territory is land held by the United States, and to which Congress of the United States applies selected parts of the constitution. At the present time, the only incorporated U.S. territory is the unorganized (and unpopulated) Palmyra Atoll.
