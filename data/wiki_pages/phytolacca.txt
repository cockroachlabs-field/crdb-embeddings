Some members of the genus are known as "pokeweeds" or similar names such as "pokebush", "pokeberry", "pokeroot" or "poke sallet".

FindArticles.com. 15 Apr, 2011. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5202/is_2005/ai_n19123469/ Other names for species of "Phytolacca" include "inkberry" and "ombú". The generic name is derived from the Greek language|Greek word  ("phyton"), meaning "plant," and the Latin word "lacca", a red dye. Phytolaccatoxin and phytolaccigenin are present (in the leaves, stems, roots, blossoms, berries etc.) in many species which are poisonous to mammals if not prepared properly. The berries are eaten by birds, which are not affected by the toxin. The small seeds with very hard outer shells remain intact in the digestive system and are eliminated whole. The genus comprises about 25 to 35 species of perennial plant|perennial herbaceous plant|herbs, shrubs, and trees growing from  tall. They have alternate simple leaves, pointed at the end, with entire or crinkled margins; the leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen. The stems are green, pink or red. The flowers are greenish-white to pink, produced in long racemes at the ends of the stems. They develop into globose Berry (botany)|berries  diameter, green at first, ripening dark purple to black."Flora of China": "Flora of North America": MacBride, J. F. (1937). "Flora of Peru".

It is a symbol of Uruguay, Argentina and gaucho culture. "P. weberbaueri" from Peru also grows to tree size. Both species have massively buttress root|buttressed bases to their trunks, and very soft wood with a high water storage capacity which makes them resistant to wildfire|grass fires and drought. In the Pacific Northwest of North America, pokeweed is an invasive species. == Uses == "Phytolacca americana" (American pokeweed, pokeweed, poke) is used as a folk medicine and as food, although all parts of it must be considered toxic unless, as folk recipes claim, it is "properly prepared." The root is never eaten and cannot be made edible. Poke salad ('poke salat') is considered part of traditional southern U.S. cuisine, where it is cooked three times in three changes of boiling water to remove some of the harmful components. Toxic constituents which have been identified include the alkaloids phytolaccine and phytolaccotoxin, as well as a glycoprotein. ==Fossil record== A "Phytolacca"-like fossil has been described from the Upper Cretaceous (late Campanian) Cerro del Pueblo Formation, Coahuila, Mexico, it is a permineralized multiple infructescence composed of berries with six locules, each containing a single seed with a curved embryo developed in a curved ovule with pendulous placentation, a berry anatomy that is similar to that of the genus "Phytolacca". Though this new plant from Coahuila shares reproductive characters with "Phytolacca", the constant number (six) of carpels per fruit and pendulous placentation support the recognition of a new genus, "Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides".PHYTOLACCACEAE INFRUCTESCENCE FROM CERRO DEL PUEBLO FORMATION, UPPER CRETACEOUS (LATE CAMPANIAN), COAHUILA, MEXICO by Sergio R.
