File:TotallyReal.svg|225px|thumb|right|The number field "Q"(âˆš2) sits inside "R", and the two embeddings of the field into "C" send every element in the field to another element of "R", hence the field is totally real. In number theory, a number field "F" is called "totally real" if for each embedding of "F" into the complex numbers the image (mathematics)|image lies inside the real numbers. Equivalent conditions are that "F" is generated over "Q" by one zero of a function|root of an integer polynomial "P", all of the roots of "P" being real; or that the tensor product of fields|tensor product algebra of "F" with the real field, over "Q", is isomorphic to a tensor power of "R". For example, quadratic fields "F" of degree 2 over "Q" are either real (and then totally real), or complex, depending on whether the square root of a positive or negative number is adjoined to "Q". In the case of cubic fields, a cubic integer polynomial "P" irreducible polynomial|irreducible over "Q" will have at least one real root. If it has one real and two complex roots the corresponding cubic extension of "Q" defined by adjoining the real root will "not" be totally real, although it is a field (mathematics)|field of real numbers. The totally real number fields play a significant special role in algebraic number theory. An abelian extension of "Q" is either totally real, or contains a totally real subfield (mathematics)|subfield over which it has degree two. Any number field that is Galois extension|Galois over the rational number|rationals must be either totally real or totally imaginary number field|totally imaginary. ==See also== *Totally imaginary number field *CM-field, a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real field ==References== * Category:Field (mathematics) Category:Algebraic number theory
