  ""Lycoperdon"" is a genus of puffball mushrooms. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 50 species. In general, it contains the smaller species such as the pear-shaped puffball and the gem-studded puffball. It was formerly classification (biology)|classified within the now-obsolete order Lycoperdales, as the type genus which, following a restructuring of fungal taxonomy brought about by molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogeny, has been split. "Lycoperdon" is now placed in the family Agaricaceae of the order Agaricales. The scientific name has been created with Greek words ("lycos" meaning "wolf" and "perdon" meaning "to fart") and based on several European dialects in which the mushroom name sounds like "wolf-farts".  Most species are edible, ranging from mild to tasting distinctly of shrimp. ==Species== * "Lycoperdon caudatum" (Syn.
