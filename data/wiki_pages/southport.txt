At the United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census, it had a population of 90,336, making it the List of North West England cities and metropolitan areas by population|eleventh most populous settlement in North West England. Southport lies on the Irish Sea coast and is fringed to the north by the Ribble and Alt Estuaries|Ribble estuary. The town is   north of Liverpool and  southwest of Preston, Lancashire|Preston. Within the boundaries of the Historic counties of England|historic county of Lancashire, the town was founded in 1792 when William Sutton (Southport)|William Sutton, an innkeeper from Churchtown, Merseyside|Churchtown, built a bathing house at what is now the south end of Lord Street, Southport|Lord Street."North Meols and Southport&nbsp;– a History", Chapter 9, Peter Aughton (1988) At that time, the area, known as South Hawes, was sparsely populated and dominated by sand dunes. At the turn of the 19th century, the area became popular with tourists due to the easy access from the nearby Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The rapid growth of Southport largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. Town attractions include Southport Pier, the second longest seaside pleasure pier in the British Isles, and Lord Street, an elegant tree-lined shopping street. Extensive sand dunes stretch for several miles from Woodvale, Merseyside|Woodvale to Birkdale, the south of the town. The Ainsdale sand dunes have been designated as a National nature reserves in England|national nature reserve and a Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site. Local fauna include the natterjack toad and the sand lizard. The town contains examples of Victorian architecture and town planning, on Lord Street and elsewhere. A particular feature of the town is the extensive tree planting. This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after them, having been built on land donated by Rev. Charles Hesketh. Southport today is still one of the most popular seaside resorts in the UK. It hosts various events, including an Southport Airshow|annual air show on and over the beach, the largest independent Southport Flower Show|flower show in the UK (in Victoria Park, Southport|Victoria Park) and the British Musical Fireworks Championship. The town is at the centre of England's Golf Coast and has hosted the Open Championship at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club.  ==History== File:Southport coat of arms.jpg|thumb|left|The coat of arms of Southport  There have been settlements in the area now comprising Southport since the Domesday Book, and some parts of the town have names of Viking origin. The earliest recorded human activity in the region was during the Middle Stone Age, when mesolithic hunter gatherers were attracted by the abundant red deer and Moose|elk population, as well as the availability of fish, shellfish and woodland. Ancient Rome|Roman coins have been found at Halsall Moss and Crossens, although the Romans never settled southwest Lancashire. The first real evidence of an early settlement here is in the Domesday Book, in which the area is called "Otergimele". The Domesday Book states that there were 50 huts in Otergimele, housing a population of 200. The population was scattered thinly across the region and it was at the northeast end of Otergimele (present day Crossens), where blown sand gave way to alluvial deposits from the River Ribble estuary, that a small concentration of people occurred. It was here, it seems, that a primitive church was built, which gave the emerging village its name of Churchtown, the parish being North Meols (pronounced "meals", not "mells"). A church called St Cuthbert's Church, Churchtown|St Cuthbert's is still at the centre of Churchtown. With a booming fishing industry, the area grew slowly and hamlets became part of the parish of North Meols. From south to north, these villages were South Hawes, Haweside, Little London, Higher Blowick, Lower Blowick, Rowe-Lane, Churchtown, Marshside, Merseyside|Marshside, Crossens, and Banks, Lancashire|Banks. As well as Churchtown, there were vicarages in Crossens and Banks. Parts of the parish were almost completely surrounded by water until 1692 when Thomas Fleetwood of Bank Hall cut a channel to drain Martin Mere to the sea. From this point on, attempts at large-scale drainage of Martin Mere and other marshland continued until the 19th century, since when the water has been pumped away. This left behind a legacy of fine agricultural soil and created a booming farming industry.  File:William Sutton plaque.JPG|thumb|Plaque dedicated to William Sutton (Southport)|William Sutton, on the corner of Duke Street In the late 18th century, it was becoming fashionable for the well-to-do to desert inland spa towns and visit the seaside to bathe in the salt sea waters. At that time, doctors recommended bathing in the sea to help cure aches and pains. In 1792, William Sutton, the landlord of the "Black Bull Inn" in Churchtown (now the "Hesketh Arms") and known to locals as "The Old Duke", realised the importance of the newly created canal systems across the UK and set up a bathing house in the virtually uninhabited dunes at South Hawes by the seaside just four miles (6&nbsp;km) away from the newly constructed Leeds and Liverpool Canal and two miles southwest of Churchtown. When a widow from Wigan built a cottage nearby in 1797 for seasonal lodgers, Sutton quickly built a new inn on the site of the bathing house which he called the South Port Hotel, moving to live there the following season.Archived at  and the :  The locals thought him mad and referred to the building as the "Duke's Folly", but Sutton arranged transport links from the canal that ran through Scarisbrick, four miles from the hotel, and trade was remarkably good. The hotel survived until 1854, when it was demolished to make way for traffic at the end of Lord Street, but its presence and the impact of its founder are marked by a plaque in the vicinity, by the name of one street at the intersection, namely Duke Street, and by a hotel on Duke Street which bears the legacy name of Dukes Folly Hotel.  File:(Municipal buildings, Southport, England) (LOC) (15618716453).jpg|thumb|left|Municipal buildings, Southport, England, ca. 1890 - 1900 Southport grew quickly in the 19th century as it gained a reputation for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour-up-the-coast Blackpool. In fact Southport had a head start compared to all the other places on the Lancashire coast because it had easy access to the canal system. Other seaside bathing areas could not really get going until the railways were built some years later. The Leeds and Liverpool canal brought people from Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton and Wigan amongst others. By 1820 Southport had over 20,000 visitors per year. File:Southport Pier 1.JPG|thumb|Southport Pier is a Grade II listed structure. At , it is the second longest in Great Britain. Southport Pier is referred to as the first true "pleasure pier", being one of the earliest pier structures to be erected using iron. A design from James Brunlees was approved at a cost of £8,700 and on 4 August 1859 a large crowd witnessed the driving home of the first support pile. The opening of the pier was celebrated on 2 August 1860. File:Southport lifeboat disaster memorial 1.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial to the crew of the "Eliza Fernley" lifeboat, in Duke Street Cemetery On the night of 9 December 1886, the worst Southport and St Anne's lifeboats disaster|lifeboat disaster in the history of the UK occurred off the shores of Southport. A cargo ship called the Mexico (barque)|"Mexico" of the wreck of the Mexico was on its way to South America when it found itself in difficulty. Lifeboats from Lytham, St. Annes and Southport set off to try to rescue those aboard the vessel. The crews battled against storm-force winds as they rowed towards the casualty. The entire crew from the St. Anne's boat was lost and all but two of the Southport crew were too. In all, 28 lifeboatmen lost their lives on that night, leaving many widows and fatherless children. A memorial was erected in Duke Street Cemetery and there is a permanent display in the museum at The Atkinson on Lord Street. There is also a memorial inside the Lifeboat house, now operated by the Southport Offshore Rescue Trust. "Mexico" was just one of many Southport shipwrecks|shipwrecks in the Southport area.  From 1894 to 1912 Birkdale and the adjoining village of Ainsdale were separate from Southport and administered by Birkdale Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District Council before becoming part of the county borough of Southport in 1912. This was a huge expansion of the town. In 1914, a very short romance story between a “2 park road Southport" private soldier and French lady took place in Valenciennes in north France during early First World War as described by Andrée Ducatez's "Journal". In 1925, the RNLI abandoned the station at Southport and left the town with no lifeboat. In the late 1980s, after a series of tragedies, local families from Southport started to raise funds and bought a new lifeboat for the town stationed at the old RNLI lifeboat house. The lifeboat, operated by the Southport Offshore Rescue Trust, is completely Independent lifeboats (British Isles)|independent from the RNLI and receives no money from them. Instead it relies entirely on donations from the general public.
