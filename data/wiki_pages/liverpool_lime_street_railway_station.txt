Opened in August 1836, it is the oldest still-operating grand terminus mainline station in the world. A branch of the West Coast Main Line from Euston railway station|London Euston terminates at the station, as does the original Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Journeys from Lime Street cover a wide range of destinations across England, Scotland and Wales. Having realised that their existing Crown Street railway station was too far away from the city centre, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway commenced construction of the more central Lime Street station in October 1833. Designed by John Cunningham (architect)|John Cunningham, Arthur Hill Holme|Arthur Holme and John Foster (architect, born 1786)|John Foster Jr, it was officially opened in August 1836. Proving to be very popular with train commuters, expansion of the station had become necessary within six years of its opening. The first expansion, which was collaboratively produced by Joseph Locke, Richard Turner (iron-founder)|Richard Turner, William Fairbairn and John Kennedy (manufacturer)|John Kennedy, was completed in 1849 at a total cost of £15,000 (). During 1867, work upon a further expansion of Lime Street station commenced, during which time the present northern arched train shed was built. Designed by William Baker (engineer)|William Baker and Francis Stevenson, the train shed was the largest such structure in the world upon completion, featuring a span of , as well as the first to make extensive use of iron. During 1879, a second parallel southern train shed was completed. Following the British Rail#Nationalisation in 1948|nationalisation of the railways in 1948, Lime Street station was the subject of various upgrades and alterations, including new signalling systems in and around the station, a redeveloped concourse, and new retail and office spaces. In 1962, regular electric services between Lime Street and Crewe railway station|Crewe were officially started and, in 1966, the station hosted the launch of its first InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity service, which saw the introduction of a regular  service between Liverpool and London. During the 1970s, a new urban rail network known as Merseyrail was developed, while all other long-distance terminal stations in Liverpool were closed, resulting in such services being centralised at Lime Street for the whole city. In October 2003, the British Rail Class 390|Pendolino service operated by Virgin Trains West Coast was ceremonially unveiled at the station, introducing a faster service between Liverpool and London. In May 2015, the electrification of the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway route was completed, as well as the line to Wigan via St Helens Central. Lime Street station is fronted by a large building designed in the Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style, the former North Western Hotel, Liverpool|North Western Hotel, which has since been converted to apartments. Since the 1970s, the main terminal building has also provided direct access to the underground rail|underground Lime Street Wirral Line station on the Merseyrail network. Beginning in the 1960s, the Concourse House office tower block and several retailers stood outside the southern train shed, but they were demolished in 2010. Lime Street is the largest and oldest railway station in Liverpool; it is one of 18 stations managed by national infrastructure maintenance company Network Rail. During 2017, work commenced at Lime Street station on a £340 million remodelling programme. In "Britain's 100 Best Railway Stations", written by columnist and editor Simon Jenkins, Lime Street Station was one of only ten stations to be awarded 5/5 stars.Jenkins, Simon and Richard Morrison.  "The Times", 9 December 2017. ==History==  The original terminus of the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR) was located at Crown Street Station|Crown Street, in Edge Hill, Liverpool|Edge Hill, to the east of and outside the city centre. However, even before Edge Hill had been opened, it was apparent that there was a pressing need for another station to be built, which would this time be closer to the city centre. Accordingly, during October 1833, the construction commenced on a purpose-built station at Lime Street in the city centre; the land was purchased from Liverpool Corporation for £9,000 (). The means of connecting the new station to L&MR's network came in the form of a twin-track tunnel, which had been constructed between Edge Hill and the site of the new Lime Street station a year prior to work being started on the station itself; during the construction effort, the tunnel was frequently used to transport building materials for the station onto the site. The station was designed by the architects John Cunningham (architect)|John Cunningham, Arthur Hill Holme|Arthur Holme, and John Foster (architect, born 1786)|John Foster Jr. File:Roscoe GJR(1839) p155 - Entrance to the Railway Station at Liverpool.jpg|thumb|A period depiction of the original Lime Street Station frontage circa 1839 During August 1836, Lime Street Station was officially opened to the public, although the construction process was not completed until the following year. This building was designed with four large gateways, two of which were intentionally nonfunctional. For its early operations, as a consequence of the steep incline uphill from Lime Street to Edge Hill, trains would be halted at Edge Hill and the locomotives detached from the trains; the practice of the era was for the passenger carriages to be taken down by gravity, during which the rate of descent would be controlled by brakeman|brakemen located in a brake van. The return journey was achieved via the use of a stationary steam engine located at Edge Hill, which would be used to haul the carriages up to Edge Hill by rope. This system was constructed by the local engineering firm Mather, Dixon and Company, who worked under the direction of the engineer John Grantham. During 1870, this practice came to an end; instead, trains would enter and depart the station by conventional means.  Lime Street Station was a near-instant success with the railway-going public. Within six years of its opening, the rapid growth of the railways had necessitated the expansion of the original station. An early plan for the enlarged station would have involved the erection of an iron roof, similar to that found at Euston railway station|Euston station (pre 1960's rebuilding) in London, which was a ridge roof supported by iron columns. However, a different proposal quickly gained the approval of the station committee. A single curved roof was produced by a collaborative effort; designed and load testing|load tested by engineer Joseph Locke, with construction contracted to iron founder Richard Turner (iron-founder)|Richard Turner, and the work checked by engineer William Fairbairn and manufacturer John Kennedy (manufacturer)|John Kennedy. The expansion work was performed at a cost of £15,000 () and was completed during 1849, by which time the noted architect William Tite had also been involved. Meanwhile, during 1845, the L&MR had been absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway. Amongst the features which date back to the 1846–1849 rebuild of the station are a group of four columns which adjoin former Platform 1, they have been attributed to engineer Edward Woods (engineer)|Edward Woods. By 1857, a pair of granite columns had been erected outside the station entrance; over time, these had become known as the "Candlesticks". During 1867, further expansion of Lime Street Station was required to cope with operational demands; changes included the present northern arched train shed. Designed by William Baker (engineer)|William Baker and Francis Stevenson}} the train shed featured a span of , leading to it being recognised as the largest such structure in the world at the time.<ref& ...
