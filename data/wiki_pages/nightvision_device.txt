A "night-vision device" ("NVD"), also known as a "night optical/observation device" ("NOD"), "night-vision goggle" ("NVG"), is an Optoelectronics|optoelectronic device that allows visualization of images in low levels of light, improving the user's night vision. The device enhances Available light|ambient visible light and converts Infrared#Regions within the infrared|near-infrared light into visible light which can be seen by the user; this is known as I<sup>2</sup> (Image intensifier|image intensification). By comparison, viewing of infrared thermal radiation is referred to as Thermography|thermal imaging and operates in a different section of the infrared spectrum. A night vision device usually consists of an image intensifier tube, a protective housing, and may have some type of mounting system. Many NVDs also include a protective sacrificial lens, mounted over the front lens (ie. Objective (optics)|objective lens) on NVDs to protect the latter from damage by environmental hazards and some can incorporate Refracting telescope|telescopic lenses. The image produced by an NVD is typically monochrome green, as green was considered to be the easiest color to look at for prolonged periods in the dark. Night vision devices may be passive, relying solely on ambient light, or may be active, using an Infrared|IR (infrared) illuminator to better visualize the environment.  Night vision devices can be handheld but many are head-mounted and attach to Combat helmet|helmets. When used with firearms, an IR Laser sight (firearms)|laser sight is often mounted to the user's weapon. The laser sight produces an infrared beam that is only visible through an NVD and aids with aiming. Some night vision devices are specially made to be mounted to firearms. These can used in conjunction with weapon sights like Telescopic sight|rifle scopes or can be used as standalone sights; some Thermal weapon sight|thermal weapon sights have been designed to provide similar capabilities. These devices were first used in World War II and came into wide use during the Vietnam War. The technology has evolved greatly since its introduction, leading to several "generations"as defined by the US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) of night-vision equipment with performance increases and price reductions. Consequently, though they are commonly Night combat|used by the military and police|law enforcement agencies, night vision devices are available to civilian users for a wide range of applications including aviation, driving, demining, etc. ==History==  Early night vision technology used prior to the end of World War II has been described as "Generation 0". In 1929 Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi invented an infrared-sensitive electronic television camera for Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defense in the UK. Night-vision devices were introduced in the German Army (1935–1945)|German Army as early as 1939 and were used in World War II. AEG started developing the first devices in 1935. In mid-1943, the German Army began the first tests with infrared night-vision () devices and telescopic rangefinders mounted on Panther tanks. Two different arrangements were constructed and used on Panther tanks. The Sperber FG 1250 ("Sparrow Hawk"), with a range of up to 600 m, had a 30&nbsp;cm infrared searchlight and an image converter operated by the tank commander. An experimental Soviet device called the PAU-2 was field-tested in 1942. From late 1944 to March 1945 the German military conducted successful tests of FG 1250 sets mounted on Panther Ausf. G tanks (and other variants). Before World War II ended in 1945, approximately 50 (or 63) Panthers had been equipped with the FG 1250 and saw combat on both the Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern and Western Front (World War II)|Western Fronts. The Zielgerät 1229|"Vampir" man-portable system for infantry was used with StG 44 assault rifles. Parallel development of night-vision systems occurred in the US. The M1 and M3 infrared night-sighting devices, also known as the "sniperscope" or "snooperscope", saw limited service with the US Army in World War II and in the Korean War, to assist snipers. These were active devices, using a large infrared light source to illuminate targets. Their image-intensifier tubes used an anode and an S-1 photocathode, made primarily of silver, cesium, and oxygen, and electrostatic inversion with electron acceleration was used to achieve gain. Examples * PAU-2 * PNV-57A tanker goggles * SU-49/PAS-5 * T-120 Sniperscope, 1st model (World War II) * M2 Sniperscope, 2nd model (World War II) * M3 Sniperscope, 4th model (Korean War) * AN/PAS-4 (early Vietnam War) After World War II, Vladimir K. Zworykin developed the first practical commercial night-vision device at Radio Corporation of America, intended for civilian use. Zworykin's idea came from a former radio-guided missile.Pennsylvania State University.  . Biographical sketch.  At that time, infrared was commonly called "black light", a term later restricted to ultraviolet. Zworykin's invention was not a success due to its size and cost. == United States ==  Image:M16A1 PVS-2.JPEG|thumb|An M16 rifle|M16A1 rifle fitted with the AN/PVS-2 Starlight scope First-generation passive devices developed and patented by the United States Army|US Army in the 1960s, introduced during the Vietnam War, were an adaptation of earlier active GEN 0 technology and relied on Available light|ambient light instead of using an extra infrared light source. Using an S-20 photocathode, their image intensifiers produced a light amplification of around , but they were quite bulky and required moonlight to function properly.  Examples: * AN/PVS-1 Starlight scope * AN/PVS-2 Starlight scope * AN/PAS 6 Varo Metascope  Image:AN-PVS-5C-Cut image.jpg|thumb|A cut-open and depotted AN/PVS-5, showing the components of a night-vision device. This device was manufactured in 2nd generation (5A to 5C) and 3rd generation (5D) Second-generation devices developed in the 1970s, featuring an improved image-intensifier tube using a micro-channel plate (MCP) with an S-25 photocathode, and resulted in a much brighter image, especially around the edges of the lens. This led to increased clarity in low ambient-light environments, such as New moon|moonless nights. Light amplification was around . Image resolution and Reliability engineering|reliability were also improved. Examples: * AN/PVS-3 Miniaturized night vision sight * AN/PVS-4 * AN/PVS-5{{Cite web  |title=AN/PVS-5 Night Vision Goggles |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/an-pvs-5.htm |access-date=16 March 2018 |website=GlobalSecurity.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210824145609/www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/gr ...
