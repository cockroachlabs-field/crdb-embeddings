It lies on the north bank of the River Thames and for postal purposes is part of the SW postcode area|south-western postal area. Chelsea historically formed a manor and parish in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex, which became the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in 1900. It merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Kensington, forming the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea upon the creation of Greater London in 1965. The exclusivity of Chelsea as a result of its high property prices historically resulted in the coining of the term "Sloane Ranger" in the 1970s to describe some of its residents, and some of those of nearby areas. Chelsea is home to one of the largest communities of Americans living outside the United States, with 6.53% of Chelsea residents having been born in the U.S. .

Chelsea hosted the Synod of Chelsea in 787 AD. The first record of the Chelsea Manor|Manor of Chelsea precedes the Domesday Book and records the fact that Thurstan, governor of the King's Palace during the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), gave the land to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster. From at least this time, up to 1900, the Manor and Parish of Chelsea included a 144-acre exclave which is now known as Kensal Town. The exclave, which was once heavily wooded, was sometimes also known as "Chelsea-in-the-Wilderness".The London Encyclopaedia, Weinreb and Hibbert, p 633  Abbot Gervace subsequently assigned the manor to his mother, and it passed into private ownership. By 1086 the Domesday Book records that Chelsea was in the Hundred (county division)|hundred of Ossulstone in Middlesex, with Edward of Salisbury as tenant-in-chief., accessed April 2017 Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII acquired the manor of Chelsea from William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys|Lord Sandys in 1536; Chelsea Manor Street is still extant. Two of King Henry's Wives of Henry VIII|wives, Catherine Parr and Anne of Cleves, lived in the Manor House; Princess Elizabeth – the future Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I – resided there; and Sir Thomas More|Thomas More lived more or less next door at Beaufort House (Chelsea)|Beaufort House. In 1609 James I of England|James I established a theological college, Chelsea College (17th century)|"King James's College at Chelsey" on the site of the future Chelsea Royal Hospital|Royal Hospital Chelsea, which Charles II of England|Charles II founded in 1682. Image:Royal-hospital-chel-fig.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure Court of Royal Hospital Chelsea By 1694, Chelsea – always a popular location for the wealthy, and once described as "a village of palaces" – had a population of 3,000. Even so, Chelsea remained rural and served London to the east as a market garden, a trade that continued until the 19th-century development boom which caused the final absorption of the district into the metropolis. The street crossing that was known as Little Chelsea, Park Walk, linked Fulham Road to King's Road and continued to the Thames and local ferry down Lover's Lane, renamed "Milmans Street" in the 18th century. Image:Rhc-charles2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of Charles II of England|King Charles II on the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea|alt= King's Road, named for Charles II, recalls the King's private road from St James's Palace to Fulham, which was maintained until the reign of George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV. One of the more important buildings in King's Road, the former Chelsea Town Hall, popularly known as "Chelsea Old Town hall" – a fine neo-classical building – contains important frescoes. Part of the building contains the Chelsea Public Library. Almost opposite stands the former Odeon Cinema, now Habitat (retailer)|Habitat, with its iconic façade which carries high upon it a large sculptured medallion of the now almost-forgotten William Friese-Greene, who claimed to have invented celluloid film and cameras in the 1880s before any subsequent patents. Image:Chelsea thomas more statue 1.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Thomas More on Cheyne Walk with Chelsea Old Church in the background (2006) The memorials in the churchyard of Chelsea Old Church (All Saints)|Chelsea Old Church, near the river, illustrate much of the history of Chelsea. These include Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre|Lord and Anne Fiennes|Lady Dacre (1594/1595); Jane Cavendish|Lady Jane Cheyne (1698); Francis Thomas, "director of the china porcelain manufactory"; Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane (1753); Thomas Shadwell, Poet Laureate (1692). The intended tomb Thomas More|Sir Thomas More erected for himself and his wives can also be found there, though More is not in fact buried here. In 1718, the Raw Silk Company was established in Little Chelsea|Chelsea Park, with mulberry trees and a hothouse for raising silkworms. At its height in 1723, it supplied silk to Caroline of Ansbach, then Princess of Wales. Chelsea once had a reputation for the manufacture of Chelsea buns, made from a long strip of sweet dough tightly coiled, with currants trapped between the layers, and topped with sugar.  The Chelsea Bun House sold these during the 18th century and was patronised by the Georgian era|Georgian royalty.  At Easter, great crowds would assemble on the open spaces of the Five Fields – subsequently developed as Belgravia.  The Bun House would then do a great trade in hot cross buns and sold about quarter of a million on its final Good Friday in 1839. The area was also famous for its "Chelsea China" ware, though the works, the Chelsea porcelain factory – thought to be the first workshop to make porcelain in England – were sold in 1769, and moved to Derby. Examples of the original Chelsea ware fetch high values. The best-known building is Chelsea Royal Hospital for old soldiers, set up by Charles II (supposedly on the suggestion of Nell Gwynne), and opened in 1694. The beautifully proportioned building by Christopher Wren stands in extensive grounds, where the Chelsea Flower show is held annually. The former Duke of York's Barracks (built 1801–3) off King's Road is now part of Duke of York Square, a redevelopment including shops and cafes and the site of a weekly "farmers' market". The Saatchi Gallery opened in the main building in 2008. Chelsea Barracks, at the end of Lower Sloane Street, was also in use until recently, primarily by ceremonial troops of the Household Division. Situated on the Westminster side of Chelsea Bridge Road, it was bought for re-development by a property group from Qatar. Image:Chelsea Bridge, River Thames, London, England.jpg|right|thumb|Chelsea Bridge from the south bank St Mark's College, Chelsea, was founded in 1841, based on the beliefs of The Reverend Derwent Coleridge, son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, its first principal: that its primary purpose was to widen the educational horizons of its students. During the World War I|First World War, St Mark's College was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. It merged with St John's College in 1923, establishing a single institution in Chelsea as the College of St Mark & St John. In 1973 it moved to Plymouth Marjon University|Plymouth, having outgrown the Chelsea campus. The former chapel of St Mark's College, designed by Edward Blore is on the Fulham Road, Chelsea, and is now a private residence. Dring the mid 1800s, Cremorne Gardens, London, was a popular pleasure gardens area established in 1845. It continued to operate until 1877. The area lay between Chelsea Harbour and the end of the King's Road. Chelsea's modern reputation as a centre of innovation and influence originated in a period during the 19th century, when the area became a Victorian artists' colony ("see #The borough of artists|Borough of artists below"). It became prominent once again as one of the centres of the "Swinging London" of the 1960s, when house prices were lower than in the staid Metropolitan Borough of Kensington|Royal Borough of Kensington.  Chelsea once had a reputation as London's Bohemianism|bohemian quarter, the haunt of artists, radicals, painters and poets. Little of this seems to survive now – the comfortable squares off King's Road are homes to, amongst others, investment bankers and film stars. The Chelsea Arts Club continues "in situ"; however, the Chelsea School of Art|Chelsea College of Art and Design, founded in 1895 as the Chelsea School of Art, moved from Manresa Road to Pimlico in 2005. The Chelsea Book Club, at no. 65 Cheyne Walk (Lombard Terrace), a bookshop that also presented exhibitions and lectures, held the first exhibition of African art in London (sculpture from Ivory Coast and Congo) in 1920, and was the first bookshop to stock Joyce's "Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses" in 1922. Sold in 1928 owing to financial problems, it became the Lombard Restaurant. Image:Wildehouse.JPG|right|thumb|Oscar Wilde's house on Tite Street, Chelsea Image:Chelsea crosby hall 1.jpg|right|thumb|Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall on Cheyne Walk. Parts of this building date back to the time of Richard III of England|Richard III, its first owner. But it is not native to Chelsea – it is a survivor of the Great Fire of London. It was shipped brick by brick from Bishopsgate in 1910 after being threatened with demolition. (January 2006) Its reputation stems from a period in the 19th century when it became a sort of Victorian artists' colony: painters such as James Webb (painter)|James Webb, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, J. M. W. Turner, James McNeill Whistler, William Holman Hunt, and John Singer Sargent all lived and worked here. There was a particularly large concentration of artists in the area around Cheyne Walk and Cheyne Row, where the Pre-Raphaelite movement had its heart. The artist Prunella Clough was born in Chelsea in 1919. The architect John Samuel Phene lived at No.&nbsp;2 Upper Cheyne Row between 1903 and his death in 1912. He installed numerous artefacts and objet d'art|objets d'art around the house and gardens and it was known locally as the "Gingerbread Castle". It was demolished in 1924. Chelsea was also home to writers such as George Meredith, Algernon Charles Swinburne, James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt and Thomas Carlyle. Jonathan Swift lived in Church Lane, Richard Steele and Tobias Smollett in Monmouth House. Carlyle lived for 47 years at No. 5 (now 24) Cheyne Row. After his death, the house was bought and turned into a shrine and literary museum by the Carlyle Memorial Trust, a group formed by Leslie Stephen, father of Virginia Woolf. Virginia Woolf set her 1919 novel "Night and Day (Woolf novel)|Night and Day" in Chelsea, where Mrs. Hilbery has a Cheyne Walk home. In a book, "Bohemia in London" by Arthur Ransome which is a partly  ...
