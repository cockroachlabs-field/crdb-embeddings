He also co-founded the Industrial Records band Throbbing Gristle (TG). After the disbandment of Throbbing Gristle, he participated in the formation of Psychic TV along with Genesis P-Orridge and Geoff Rushton—Rushton later changed his name to John Balance. After his short time in Psychic TV, Christopherson formed Coil (band)|Coil with Balance, which lasted for just under 23 years, until Balance died of a fall in the Weston-super-Mare home he shared with Christopherson. Christopherson participated in the reunification of Throbbing Gristle and, after his relocation to Thailand in 2005, composed an album for his solo endeavour The Threshold HouseBoys Choir. Christopherson died in his sleep on 25 November 2010. ==Early life== Christopherson was born on 27 February 1955 in Leeds, Yorkshire, England. His father, Derman Christopherson, was a professor of engineering who became master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. Following school, Christopherson studied computer programming, theatre design, and video at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York,  where he developed an interest in performance art and the work of avant-garde photographers such as Robert Mapplethorpe and Arthur Tress. ==Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV, and Coil== Christopherson was a founding member of Throbbing Gristle, who are credited with creating the industrial music genre before disbanding in 1981. Following the split, members Chris Carter (British musician)|Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti formed Chris & Cosey, while Christopherson and the band's other member Genesis P-Orridge formed Psychic TV with John Balance and other musicians. Balance met Christopherson as a Throbbing Gristle fan and the two became intimate partners. Christopherson worked on the first two Psychic TV albums, "Force the Hand of Chance" and "Dreams Less Sweet", joined by Balance on the latter. The two performed live several times with Psychic TV prior to forming their own project Coil. Coil consisted of Christopherson and Balance, while Steven E. Thrower occasionally played bass guitar and drums. Balance was the lyricist and also played Chapman Stick and some keyboards. Over two decades, Coil released myriad recordings, in addition to contributing to the work of other artists. They recorded parts of the album "The New Backwards" at Nothing Studios in New Orleans, owned by musician Trent Reznor at the time. In the liner notes of the 2008 CD release, Christopherson wrote: "Thanks to everyone there, especially Trent Reznor who made it all possible." Despite Christopherson's long and extensive history as a musical artist, he only released two tracks under the name "Peter Christopherson". The first, "In My Head A Crystal Sphere of Heavy Fluid", appeared on the compilation "Foxtrot", a benefit album for Balance's rehabilitation from alcohol dependence, while the second, "All Possible Numbers", appeared eleven years later on "Autumn Blood (Constructions)" released on Fourth Dimension Records. In 2005, following the death of Balance, Christopherson relocated from England to Bangkok, Thailand and founded the solo project The Threshold HouseBoys Choir. He also released the final Coil CDs—"The Remote Viewer", "Black Antlers", "...And The Ambulance Died in His Arms" and "The New Backwards"—on the band's own Threshold House label. In addition to the CD releases, Christopherson also released a 16-DVD box set following his relocation, entitled "Colour Sound Oblivion", that was produced in a wooden box, in which a fifteen-page booklet, the program for Balance's funeral ceremony and a large collection of 6-inch × 4-inch postcards (mainly tour photographs) were also included. Throbbing Gristle also reformed for a few concerts in 2005 and announced a new album called "Part Two (Throbbing Gristle album)|Part Two". The group announced several additional concerts in 2007 for the promotion of the album. == Other musical projects == In 2007 Christopherson released the debut album of The Threshold HouseBoys Choir. The album, "Form Grows Rampant", consists of five "parts" or songs, and includes a DVD of the album set to video footage of Thai people|Thai rituals in Krabi, Thailand.Archived at  and the : Archived at  and the :  One tour promoter who organized a Threshold HouseBoys Choir concert described it as "easily the most shocking thing I have ever experienced". In 2008 Christopherson and Ivan Pavlov (aka CoH (musician)|CoH) started a new project called Soisong. The band officially premiered in Tokyo on 9 March 2008 and later performed several shows in Europe, having self-released their debut Extended play|EP. As part of the tour, Soisong performed a live soundtrack to Derek Jarman's film "Blue (1993 film)|Blue" in Rovereto, Italy. In April of the same year, Christopherson and Pavlov, alongside David Tibet, Othon Mataragas and Ernesto Tomasini, also performed a live soundtrack for "The Angelic Conversation (film)|The Angelic Conversation" in Turin, Italy. In 2009 Soisong recorded their first full-length album "xAj3z", the release of which was followed by a European "Reunion Tour" and a worldwide campaign in search of the band's missing virtual vocalists featured on the record. In 2010 Soisong declared a "Split Phase 2010", during which all of the members would concentrate on their personal work; however, two independently recorded solo EPs, both entitled "Soisong", were scheduled for release. Christopherson never finalized his work for the release, but "Soisong Split" was eventually published in September 2012, nearly two years after Christopherson's death. The release consists of a CoH "Soisong" EP by Pavlov, originally recorded in 2010, and a collection of four unpublished sketches by Christopherson that were made available on the band's website. In 2010 Christopherson started collaborating with Hirsute Pursuit, featuring Harley Phoenix and Bryin Dall, via email. They finished two songs together, "One Sleazy Night in Bangkok" and "One Sleazy Night in New Orleans", for the album "Tighten That Muscle Ring". The album was signed to Cold Spring Records, but Christopherson died prior to its release. Writing for the "Quietus" online publication, Luke Turner claimed that the album was "the most sexy and perverted album of 2012". Also in 2010, Christopherson was sent an iPad by musician Trent Reznor that contained music for a potential collaboration. Reznor had asked for his blessing to use the moniker "How to Destroy Angels (band)|How to Destroy Angels" for a musical project that Reznor was creating with his wife (Christopherson had used the phrase in 1984, as the title of How to Destroy Angels (Coil EP)|the first recording released by Coil). Christopherson responded amenably, suggesting that they could potentially collaborate as part of the project. Christopherson explained that Reznor was a "perfect gentleman" in regard to the way in which the matter was negotiated; however, Christopherson died before he was able to resend the iPad back to Reznor with his contribution. The final music that was ever recorded by Christopherson occurred in Bangkok, Thailand with a project named "Electric Sewer Age" that also involved musician Danny Hyde. The original intention of the recordings was to complete a series of releases called "Moons Milk", but an album called "In Final Phase" was eventually released in 2013, with only 999 numbered CD copies made available. The CD is packaged in record sleeve-style thickened cardboard, and each copy is numbered from 1 to 999, while the insert sleeve displays a picture of Christopherson in his Bangkok studio that was taken at the moment that the recording was completed. ==Influence== File:Peter Christopherson @ A2.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Christopherson in 2008 Writing for "The Guardian", Dave Simpson credited Christopherson with using digital sampler (musical instrument)|samplers on-stage before the Fairlight CMI popularised sampling. Also writing for "The Guardian", Alexis Petridis described Carter and Christopherson as "pioneers in technology", and noted a sampler that Carter had custom-built for Christopherson a number of years before sampling became popular. Christopherson explained Carter's construction and musical experimentation in a 1987 interview with "Keyboard" magazine: <blockquote>It was a box that  Chris Carter made for me, to my design that basically switched on and off – through inputs on tape recorders – six cassette machines, the output of each going to a different key. Many of the machines I used in TG were cassette machines that were stripped down and altered to play backward and forward and four tracks at once, the speed variable by flywheels. The very first sampling device there ever was, as far as I know, was manufactured by Mountain Hardware for Apple computers. It was designed to reproduce voice samples, and had a very limited selection of pitches. I was using that onstage in '79 or '80, which was before the first Fairlight was used commercially. So I've always had a soft spot for sampling.</blockquote> ==Visual art== Prior to his musical projects, Christopherson was a commercial artist, designer, and photographer. Notably, he was one of the three partners of the album cover design group Hipgnosis, which was responsible for many notable album covers of the 1970s, such as those of Pink Floyd ("Wish You Were Here") and Peter Gabriel (first three albums). He also designed the logo of UK fashion label BOY London. As a freelance photographer, Christopherson shot the first promotional images of the Sex P ...
