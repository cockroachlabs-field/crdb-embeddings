It is the site of the historic capital of the Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Empire, a naval and trading power that ruled the whole region in addition parts of West Asia as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Southern Egypt and Sudan. It ruled the region from about 400 BCE into the 10th century. In 1980, UNESCO added Axum's archaeological sites to its list of World Heritage Sites due to their historic value. Axum is located in the Central Zone, Tigray|Central Zone of the Tigray Region, near the base of the Adwa mountains. It has an elevation of  and is surrounded by La'ilay Maychew, a separately administered List of districts in the Tigray Region|woreda of the Tigray region. ==History== File:The_Kingdom_of_Aksum.png|thumb|upright=1.8| Aksumite empire's maximum extent of influence, based on p. 97 of "The Times Complete History of the World" Axum was the hub of the marine trading power known as the Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Empire, which predated the earliest mentions in ancient Rome|Roman-era writings. Around 356 CE, its ruler was converted to Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|an Abyssinian variety of Christianity by Frumentius. Later, under the reign of the Emperor Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb, Axum was a quasi-ally of Byzantium against the Sasanian Empire which had adopted Zoroastrianism. The historical record is unclear with ancient church records being the primary contemporary sources. It is believed the empire began a long and slow decline after the 7th century due partly to the Persians and then the Arabs contesting old Red Sea trade routes. Eventually the empire was cut off from its principal markets in Alexandria, Byzantium and Southern Europe and its share of trade captured by Arab traders of the era.  File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Axumite Empire showing its relation to other polities in 565 The Aksumite Empire was finally destroyed in the 10th century by Empress Gudit, and eventually some of the people of Axum were forced south and their old way of life declined. As the empire's power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) emperor to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the empire's influence and power had ended long before that. Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power hub of the Ethiopian Empire south to the Amhara Region|Amhara region as it moved further inland. In this period the city of Axum became the administrative seat of an empire spanning one million square miles. Eventually, the alternative name of Ethiopia was adopted by the central region and then by the modern state that presently exists.G. Mokhtar, "UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. II, Abridged Edition" (Berkeley: University of Aksum Press, 1990), pp. 215-35.  "Axum" (or its Greek and Latin equivalents) appears as an important centre on indigenous maps of the northern Horn of Africa in the 15th century.Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

File:Ousas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Aksumite Kingdom began to issue coins about AD 270. Silver and bronze coins for local, everyday use generally followed the design of Roman coins with a bust of the ruler in profile on at least one side. Axumite coins were the first in the ancient world to carry the cross as a symbol of the ruler's devotion to Christianity. This 6th century gold coin probably depicts the Axumite king Ousas The Aksumite Empire had its own written language, Geʽez, and developed a distinctive architecture exemplified by giant obelisks. The oldest of these, though relatively small, dates from 5000–2000 BCE.Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. "Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha" (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 871. The empire was at its height under Emperor Ezana of Axum|Ezana, baptized as Abreha in the 4th century (which was also when the empire officially embraced Christianity).Fage, J. D., "A History of Africa" (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 53–4.  The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims that the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum houses the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, in which lie the Tablets of Stone upon which the Ten Commandments are inscribed.Hodd, Mike, "Footprint East Africa Handbook" (New York: Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), p. 859. . Ethiopian traditions suggest that it was from Axum that Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, journeyed to visit King Solomon in Jerusalem and that the two had a son, Menelik I|Menelik, who grew up in Ethiopia but travelled to Jerusalem as a young man to visit his father's homeland. He lived several years in Jerusalem before returning to his country with the Ark of the Covenant. According to the Ethiopian Church and Ethiopian tradition, the Ark still exists in Axum. This same church was the site where Ethiopian emperors were crowned for centuries until the reign of Fasilides, then again beginning with Yohannes IV until the end of the empire.  Axum is considered to be the holiest city in Ethiopia and is an important destination of pilgrimages.See Linda Kay Davidson and David Gitlitz "Pilgrimage, from the Ganges to Graceland: an Encyclopedia" (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002), 17–18. Significant religious festivals are the Timkat festival (known as Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany in western Christianity) on 19 January (20 January in leap years) and the Festival of Maryam Zion on 30 November (21 Hidar on the Ethiopian calendar). File:Rome_Stele.jpg|thumb|upright|The Obelisk of Axum after being returned to Ethiopia. In 1937, a  tall, 1,700-year-old Obelisk of Axum, was broken into five parts by the Italians and shipped to Rome to be erected. The obelisk is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of engineering from the height of the Axumite empire. Despite a 1947 United Nations agreement that the obelisk would be shipped back, Italy balked, resulting in a long-standing diplomatic dispute with the Ethiopian government, which views the obelisk as a symbol of national identity. In April 2005, Italy finally returned the obelisk pieces to Axum amidst much official and public rejoicing; Italy also covered the US$4 million costs of the transfer. UNESCO assumed responsibility for the re-installation of this stele in Axum, and by the end of July 2008 the obelisk had been reinstalled. It was unveiled on 4 September 2008.  File:Hijra Abyssinia (Rashid ad-Din).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A 14th century illustration showing the Christian ruler of Aksum (Negus "Atse" Armah, also known as Al-Najashi) declining the request of a pagan Meccan delegation to hand over the first Muslims who had received refuge in the city during the first Migration to Abyssinia|Hijra after Muhammad told them to take refuge there. The Aksumite Empire had a long-standing relationship with Islam. According to ibn Hisham,ibn Hisham, "The Life of the Prophet" when Muhammad faced oppression from the Quraysh clan in Mecca, he Migration to Abyssinia|sent a small group of his original followers, that included his daughter Ruqayya and her husband Uthman, to Axum. The Negus, the Aksumite monarch (known as An-Najashi (النجاشي) in the Islamic tradition), gave them refuge and protection and refused the requests of the Quraish clan to send the refugees back to Arabia. These refugees did not return until the sixth Hijri year (628 C.E.) and even then many remained in Ethiopia, eventually settling at Negash in what is now the Misraqawi Zone. There are different traditions concerning the effect these early Muslims had on the ruler of Axum. The Muslim tradition is that the ruler of Axum was so impressed by these refugees that he became a secret convert.Ibn Ishaq, "The Life of Muhammad" (Oxford, 1955), 657–58. On the other hand, Arabic historians and Ethiopian tradition state that some of the Muslim refugees who lived in Ethiopia during this time converted to Orthodox Christianity. There is also a second Ethiopian tradition that, on the death of Ashama ibn Abjar, Muhammed is reported to have prayed for the king's soul, and told his followers, "Leave the Abyssinians in peace, as long as they do not take the offensive."Paul B. Henze, "Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia" (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 42f  In February 1893 the British explorers, James Theodore Bent and his wife Mabel Bent, travelled by boat to Massawa on the west coast of the Red Sea. They then made their way overland to excavate at Axum and Yeha, in the hope of researching possible links between early trading networks and cultures on both sides of the Red Sea.Bent published the trip in his: "The sacred city of the Ethiopians: being a record of travel and research in Abyssinia in 1893", London, Longmans, Green and Co, 1894. They reached Axum by 24 February 1893,"The Travel Chronicles of Mrs J. Theodore Bent", Vol. 2, 2012, Oxford, Archaeopress, page 201. but their work was curtailed‘Theodore Bent’s expedition to Abyssinia for the purpose of investigating the ruins of Aksum has not been so successful as might have been wished, owing to the hostilities which are being carried on between two of the chiefs; indeed, he and Mrs. Bent had a narrow escape from being involved in their hostilities. Still the expedition has not been altogether without interesting results.’ (M._E._Grant_Duff|Mountstuart E.
