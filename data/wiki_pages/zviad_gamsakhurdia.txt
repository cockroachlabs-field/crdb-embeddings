(; ; 31 March 1939 – 31 December 1993) was a Georgia (country)|Georgian politician, dissident, scholar, and writer who became the President of Georgia#List of presidents of Georgia|first democratically elected President of Georgia in the post-Soviet era. A prominent exponent of Georgian nationalism, Zviad Gamsakhurdia was involved in Soviet dissidents|Soviet dissident movement from his early teens. In 1953, he was one of the founders of Gorgasliani, a nationalist group, which disseminated anti-Soviet proclamations in Tbilisi. His activities attracted attention of Soviet intelligence, and Gamsakhurdia was arrested and sent to imprisonment, although he was soon pardoned and released from jail. Gamsakhurdia co-founded the Georgian Helsinki Watch|Helsinki Group, which sought to bring attention to human rights violations in the Soviet Union. He organized numerous pro-independence protests in Georgia, April 9 tragedy|one of which in 1989 was suppressed by the Soviet Army, with Gamsakhurdia being arrested. Eventually, a number of underground political organizations united around Zviad Gamsakhurdia and formed the Round Table—Free Georgia coalition, which successfully challenged the ruling Communist Party of Georgia in the 1990 Georgian Supreme Soviet election|1990 elections. Gamsakhurdia was elected as the President of Georgia in 1991, gaining 87% of votes in 1991 Georgian presidential election|election. Despite popular support, Gamsakhurdia found significant opposition from the urban intelligentsia and former Soviet nomenklatura, as well as from his own ranks. In late 1991 Gamsakhurdia was couped by warlords Tengiz Kitovani, Jaba Ioseliani and Tengiz Sigua, two of which were formerly allied with Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia was forced to flee to Chechnya, where he was greeted by Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev. His supporters continued to fight post-coup government of Eduard Shevardnadze. In September 1993, Gamsakhurdia returned to Georgia and tried to regain power. Despite initial success, the rebellion was eventually crushed by the government forces with the help of Russian military. Gamsakhurdia was forced to go into hiding in Samegrelo, a Zviadists|Zviadist stronghold. He was found dead in early 1994 in controversial circumstances. His death remains uninvestigated to this day, with many speculating that Gamsakhurdia was betrayed and killed by someone from his own circle under the instruction of the government. After the Georgian Civil War|civil war ended, the government continued to suppress Gamsakhurdia's supporters, even with brutal tactics. Nevertheless, Gamsakhurdia is considered as the best President by the majority of Georgians to this day. He was rehabilitated by the President Mikheil Saakashvili and awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia by the President Giorgi Margvelashvili. Government officials as well as people pay tribute to memory of Zviad Gamsakhurdia every year on his birthday. He is universally recognized in the country as the best leader of post-independence Georgia. Gamsakhurdia was a prominent proponent of Georgian nationalism. He campaigned against what he considered as the demographic replacement of ethnic Georgians by Communist Party of Georgia (Soviet Union)|Communist authorities, artificial increasing of ethnic minority population in Georgia and discrimination of Georgians. Gamsakhurdia also promoted pan-Caucasian views and unity of the Peoples of the Caucasus in the face of Russian imperialism. Gamsakhurdia considered Georgians to be inherently European nation and belonging to the European civilization. ==Gamsakhurdia as dissident==  Zviad Gamsakhurdia was born in the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 1939, in a distinguished Georgian family; his father, Academician Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (1893–1975), was one of the most famous Georgian writers of the 20th century. Perhaps influenced by his father, Zviad received training in philology and began a professional career as a translator and literary critic. In 1955, Zviad Gamsakhurdia established a youth underground group which he called the "Gorgasliani" (a reference to the ancient line of Georgian kings) which sought to circulate reports of human rights abuses. In 1956, he was arrested during 1956 Georgian demonstrations|demonstrations in Tbilisi against the Soviet Union|Soviet policy of de-stalinization and was arrested again in 1958 for distributing anti-communist literature and proclamations. He was confined for six months to a mental hospital in Tbilisi, where he was diagnosed as suffering from "psychopathy with decompensation", thus perhaps becoming an early victim of what became a widespread policy of Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|using psychiatry for political purposes.  Gamsakhurdia achieved wider prominence in 1972 during a campaign against the corruption associated with the appointment of a new Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Catholicos of the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox Church, of which he was a "fervent"Kolstø, Pål. "Political Construction Sites: Nation-Building in Russia and the Post-Soviet States", p. 70. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, 2000. adherent. In 1973 he co-founded the Georgian Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights (four years earlier a Moscow-based group of that name sent an appeal to the UN Human Rights Committee); in 1974 he became the first Georgian member of Amnesty International; and in 1976 he co-founded and became chairman of the Georgian Helsinki Watch|Helsinki Group.When the body was revived in the late 1980s it was renamed the Georgian Helsinki Union. He was also active in the underground network of "samizdat" publishers, contributing to a wide variety of underground political periodicals: among them were "Okros Satsmisi" ("The Golden Fleece"), "Sakartvelos Moambe" ("The Georgian Herald"), "Sakartvelo" ("Georgia"), "Matiane" ("Annals") and "Vestnik Gruzii". He contributed to the Moscow-based underground periodical "Chronicle of Current Events" (April 1968 – December 1982). Gamsakhurdia was also the first Georgian member of the International Society for Human Rights (ISHR-IGFM). Perhaps seeking to emulate his father, Zviad Gamsakhurdia also pursued a distinguished academic career. He was a senior research fellow of the Institute of Georgian Literature of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (1973–1977, 1985–1990), associate professor of the Tbilisi State University (1973–1975, 1985–1990) and member of the Union of Georgia's Writers (1966–1977, 1985–1991), PhD in the field of Philology (1973) and Doctor of Sciences (Full Doctor, 1991). He wrote a number of important literary works, monographs and translations of British, French and American literature, including translations of works by T. S. Eliot, William Shakespeare, Charles Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde. He was also an outstanding Rustvelologist (Shota Rustaveli was a great Georgian poet of the 12th century) and researcher of history of the Iberian-Caucasian culture. Although he was frequently harassed and occasionally arrested for his dissidence, for a long time Gamsakhurdia avoided serious punishment, probably as a result of his family's prestige and political connections. His luck ran out in 1977 when the activities of the Helsinki Groups in the Soviet Union became a serious embarrassment to the Soviet government of Leonid Brezhnev. A nationwide crackdown on human rights activists was instigated across the Soviet Union and members of the Helsinki Groups in Moscow, Lithuania, Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia were arrested. In Georgia, the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (who was then General Secretary|First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party) arrested Gamsakhurdia and his fellow dissident Merab Kostava on 7 April 1977.  There remains some dispute about Gamsakhurdia's behaviour or strategy during his pre-trial detention and the trial itself. In particular, this concerns a TV broadcast in which, apparently, he recanted his activities as a human rights activist. A contemporary and uncensored account of these events may be found in the "Chronicle of Current Events". The two men were sentenced to three years in the camps plus three years' exile for "anti-Soviet activities". Gamsakhurdia did not appeal but his sentence was commuted to two years' exile in neighbouring Dagestan. Their imprisonment attracted international attention. Kostava's appeal was rejected and he was sent to a penal colony for three years, followed by three years' exile or internal banishment to Siberia. Kostava's sentence only ended in 1987. At the end of June 1979, Gamsakhurdia was released from jail and pardoned in controversial circumstances. By then, taking pre-trial detention into account, he had served two years of his sentence. The authorities claimed that he had confessed to the charges and recanted his beliefs; a film clip was shown on Soviet television to substantiate their claim. at British Helsinki Human Rights Group website   According to a transcript published by the Soviet news agency ITAR-TASS|TASS, Gamsakhurdia spoke of "how wrong was the road I had taken when I disseminated literature hostile to the Soviet state. Bourgeois propaganda seized upon my mistakes and created a hullabaloo around me, which causes me pangs of remorse. I have realized the essence of the pharisaic campaign launched in the West, camouflaged under the slogan of 'upholding human rights.'" His supporters, family and Merab Kostava claimed that his recantation was coerced by the KGB, and although he publicly acknowledged that certain aspects of his anti-Soviet endeavors were mistaken, he did not renounce his leadership of the dissident movement in Georgia. Perhaps more importantly, his actions ensured that the dissident leadership could remain active. Kostava and Gamsakhurdia later both independently stated that the latter's recantation had been a tactical move. In an open letter to Shevardnadze, dated 19 April 1992, Gamsakhurdia claimed that "my so-called confession was necessitated ...  if there had been no 'confession' and my release from the prison in 1979 had not taken place, then there would not have been a rise of the national movement." Gamsakhurdia returned to dissident activities soon after his release, continuing to contribute to "samizdat" periodicals and campaigning for the release of Merab Kostava. In 1981 he became the spokesman of the students and others who protested in Tbilisi about the threats to Georgian identity and the Georgian cultural heritage. He handed a set of "Demands of the Georgian People" to Shevardnadze outside the Congress of the Georgian Writers Union at the end of March 1981, which earned him another spell in jail.
