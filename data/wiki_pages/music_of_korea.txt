   Image:Korean.Music-Parade-01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Traditional music parade in Seoul. The Korea|Music of Korea refers to music from the Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula, ranging from prehistoric times to the division of Korea into South and North in 1945. It includes court music, folk music, poetic songs, and religious music used in shamanistic and Buddhist traditions. Together, traditional Korean music is referred to as "gugak" (Hangul: Íµ≠ÏïÖ), which literally means "national music." ==History==  Not much is known about music from the Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms of Korea|Proto-Three Kingdoms of Korea period (before 57 Common Era|BCE). It is believed that Korean people practiced Shamanism|shamanistic rituals involving music at agricultural festivals. Tomb murals and ceramics from this period depict string instruments with complex features that suggest the instruments were quite developed.  The Three Kingdoms of Korea refers to the period from 57 BCE to 668 CE when the Korean peninsula was ruled by three kingdoms: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. Each kingdom was known for favoring different musical instruments. = In Goguryeo, an oboe called a "Piri (instrument)|piri", a lute called a "pipa", and a zither that is still used today called a "geomungo" were popular instruments. According to the Korean historical record, "Samguk sagi", written in 1145, the "geomungo" was invented by prime minister Wang San-ak, who had received a Chinese zither called a "guqin" as a gift. Wang did not know how to play the "guqin" so he used it as a model in order to build a new instrument he called the "geomungo." A painting of the instrument is found in a tomb in modern-day Jilin|Jilin Province, China. The Chinese historical text "Records of the Three Kingdoms" noted "The people of Goguryeo like to sing and dance. Men and women in villages throughout the country gather every night to sing and dance." Surviving songs from the era include, "Song of the Turtle," and "Song of Nightingales," the latter of which was sung by Yuri of Goguryeo|King Yuri of Goguryeo. = The only song of Baekje conveyed until now is Jeongeupsa (Ï†ïÏùçÏÇ¨), but since there are no specific relics such as the mural tombs of Goguryeo, it is quite difficult to grasp what it would be like. It is evident that Baekje also celebrated a harvest festival in May and October similar to that of Goguryeo. The music of Baekje was known to Liu Song Dynasty and Northern Wei, while some music players were invited to Japan. Notably, a man of Baekje named Mimaji (ÎØ∏ÎßàÏßÄ) learned music and dance in China and emigrated to Japan in 612. In 2001, Emperor of Japan Akihito said the music of Baekje is the root of Japanese royal music, since Emperor Kanmu (r. 871‚Äì896) himself was a descendant of Muryeong of Baekje|King Muryeong (r. 501‚Äì523). = File: Korea-Gaya Uruk Museum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The museum of Ureuk in Goryeong, Gyeongssangbuk-do where it demonstrates the development of music in Gaya and Silla. Before Silla unified three kingdoms, the music of Silla is represented by a traditional instrument, gayageum which was said that Ureuk from Gaya confederacy|Gaya brought it in the reign of Jinheung of Silla|King Jinheung when his kingdoms were incorporated by Silla forces. Although Samguk Sagi conveys 12 names of compositions Ureuk did, those are not fully inherited. In the 13th year of Jinheung, Ureuk taught gayageum, songs, and dances to three disciples of Gyego, Beopji y Mandeok. Later the famed scholar, Choi Chiwon who studied in Tang dynasty away from bone rank system of Silla chartered five poems of "hyangak" (The local music) which depict performing arts in Silla toward the end of its era. These figures are found in history books, Goryeosa as a court ballet performance consisting of hyangak and dangak in subcategories of Korean music.  = After unification, the music of Silla experienced the influx of diverse music from Baekje and Goguryeo with the wider development of hyangak, especially in gayageum, geomungo, bipa of three string instruments and other three pipes. Additionally, music from the Tang dynasty was introduced under the reign of Munmu of Silla|King Munmu. The Buddhist chant, Beompae (hangul Î≤îÌå®, hanja Ê¢µÂîÑ) was widely adopted with variety of instruments, forming a unique art of Silla. During unified Silla, the royal institute of music (en hangul: ÏùåÏÑ±ÏÑú) was established.  Taejo of Goryeo, the founder of Goryeo followed several customs of Silla which can be found in a series of Buddhist celebrations such as Palgwanhoe and Yeondeunghoe. However, the influence of Silla dramatically diminished in the middle of its period owing to the influx of music from Song, establishing a strong influence on Korean court music. A large banquet where performances handed down from Silla such as the sword dance was conducted. Most of Goryeo songs were recorded in Akhak gwebeom after the 15th century of which features were the lyrics of the Korean language, different from those of previous eras. Goryeo court dance named jeongjae can be divided into two categories: native dances of hyangak jeongjae (Ìñ•ÏïÖÏ†ïÏû¨); Tang-derived dangak jeongjae (ÎãπÏïÖÏ†ïÏû¨). Additionally, folk dances were practiced by monks and shamans.  As Yi Seong-gye founded Joseon in 1392, the dynasty adopted anti-Buddhism and pro-Confucianism which affected the musical pattern of Yeak (ÏòàÏïÖ, Á¶ÆÊ®Ç). Although some scholars like Jeong Do-jeon made several songs for celebrating the initial moments of Joseon, the notation followed the trends of Goryeo. Joseon periods saw considerable developments of its music during the reign of Sejong which were largely attributable to a musician Park Yeon.Shin hyong-sik, „ÄäA Brief History of Korea„Äã, Vol. 1, Ewha Woman's University Press, 2005.  pp.74-75 Park firstly established an independent organ of music and created Music Notation|Korean-style notation including Jeonganbo (en Hangul: Ï† ...
