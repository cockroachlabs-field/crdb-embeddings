Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil), right whales were once a preferred target for whalers. At present, they are among the most endangered whales in the world, and they are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act and Canada's Species at Risk Act. There are fewer than 370 individuals in existence in the western North Atlantic Ocean—they migrate between feeding grounds in the Labrador Sea and their winter calving areas off Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia and Florida, an ocean area with heavy shipping traffic. In the eastern North Atlantic, on the other hand—with a total population reaching into the low teens at most—scientists believe that they may already be functional extinction|functionally extinct. #Ship strikes|Vessel strikes and #Fishing gear entanglement|entanglement in fixed fishing gear, which together account for nearly half of all North Atlantic right whale mortality since 1970, are their two greatest threats to recovery.  == Description == File:EubalaenaGlacialisPisa.JPG|thumb|left|Skeleton specimen exhibited in Pisa Charterhouse|Museo di storia naturale e del territorio dell'Università di Pisa Like other right whales, the North Atlantic right whale, also known as the "northern right whale" or "black right whale", is readily distinguished from other cetaceans by the absence of a dorsal fin on its broad back, short, paddle-like pectoral flippers and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its coloration is dark grey to black, with some individuals occasionally having white patches on their stomachs or throats. Other unique features include a large head, which makes up a quarter of its total body length, narrow tail stock in comparison to its wide fluke and v-shaped blowhole which produces a heart-shaped blow. NOAA Fisheries|last=Fisheries|first=NOAA|date=2019-10-17|website=www.fisheries.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2019-11-28}} The most distinguishing feature for right whales is their Callosity|callosities, rough, white patches of keratinized skin found on their heads.  The right whale's callosities provide habitat for large colonies of Whale louse|cyamids or whale louse|whale lice, which feed on the right whale's skin as these small crustaceans cannot survive in open water. Whales online|date=2017-06-30|website=Baleines en direct|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-11-28}} The relationship between cyamids and right whales is Symbiosis|symbiotic in nature but is poorly understood by scientists. Callosities are not caused by the external environment and are present on fetuses before birth. However, Cyamids near the blowhole have been linked to chronic entanglement and other injuries; their presence in this area has been used as measure of individual health in visual health assessments. Adult North Atlantic right whales average  in length and weigh approximately , they are slightly smaller on average than the North Pacific species. The largest measured specimens have been  long and .Whale and Dolphin Conservation,  Females are larger than males. Up to forty-five percent of a right whale's body weight is blubber. This high percentage causes their body to float after death due to the low density of blubber. There is little data on their lifespan, but it is believed to be at least 70 years although individuals in species closely related to right whales have been found to live more than 100 years. Currently, female North Atlantic Right whales live on average 45 years and males 65 years. Age of right whales can be determined by examining their earwax postmortem. == Behavior ==  File:North Atlantic right whale.jpg|thumb|"SAG" (Surface Active Group) File:Anim1750 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Cow and calf  Aside from mating activities performed by groups of single female and several males, so called "SAG (Surface Active Group)", North Atlantic right whales seem less active compared to Southern right whale|subspecies in southern hemisphere. However, this could be due to intense difference in number of surviving individuals especially calves that tend to be more curious and playful than adults, and small amount of observations. They are also known to interact with other baleen whales especially with Humpback whalesProvincetown Center for Coastal Studies. 2007.  .

Many effective automated methods, such as signal processing, data mining, and machine learning techniques are used to detect and classify their calls.M. Pourhomayoun, P. Dugan, M. Popescu, and C. Clark (2013). Bioacoustic Signal Classification Based on Continuous Region Features, Grid Masking Features and Artificial Neural Network. International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).  North Atlantic right whales are promiscuous breeders. They first give birth at age nine or ten after a year-long gestation; the interval between births seems to have increased since the 1990s, and now averages three to six years. Calves are  long at birth and weigh approximately .  Right whales feed mainly on copepods and other small invertebrates such as krill, pteropods, and larval barnacles, generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the ocean surface. Sei whales and basking sharks (sometimes minke whales as well) are in positions as food competitors and are known to feed in the same areas, swimming next to each other,O’Donnell E., 2012, , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Retrieved on May 13, 2014 but there have not been any conflicts observed between these species. == Taxonomy ==  File:Bay Wharf whale Picture 0113.jpg|upright|thumb|North Atlantic right whale skeleton found on the Thames in 2010 at Bay Wharf, Greenwich The whale's Binomial nomenclature|scientific name is "Eubalaena glacialis", which means "good, or true, whale of the ice". The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Atlantic right whale and the other members of its family.  |cladogram={{clade| style=font-size:90%;line-height:92%;width:600px;              |label1=&nbsp;Family Balaenidae&nbsp;              |1={{clade                   |label1=&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eubalaena" (right whales)&nbsp;&nbsp;                 ...
