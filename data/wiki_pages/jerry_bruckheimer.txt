He graduated from Mumford High School (Michigan)|Mumford High School in 1961 in Detroit, at age 17, before moving to Arizona for college. Bruckheimer was also an active member of the Stamp Collecting Club. He graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Arizona. He was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. A film buff at an early age with an interest in photography, Bruckheimer would take snapshots when he had the opportunity. After college, Bruckheimer worked in advertising in Detroit (creative producer) and New York City. At the Detroit agency he worked on a one minute ad spot for the new Pontiac GTO. Early in his career, Bruckheimer produced television commercials, including one for Pepsi.  Bruckheimer started producing films in the 1970s after leaving his job in advertising, with director Dick Richards. They worked together on the films "The Culpepper Cattle Company", "Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely", and "March or Die (film)|March or Die". Bruckheimer then worked with Paul Schrader on two films, "American Gigolo" and "Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People", which began to give him notice in Hollywood. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a co-producer with Don Simpson of a string of highly successful films for Paramount Pictures. He first met Simpson at a screening of 1973's "The Harder They Come" at Warner Brothers. The two worked together and created Bruckheimer's first big hit, 1983's "Flashdance", which brought in $95 million. He had a number of other hits during that time period, including the "Beverly Hills Cop" films, "Top Gun", and "Days of Thunder". "Top Gun" marked his first collaboration with English director Tony Scott, who directed six films for Bruckheimer. The first "Beverly Hills Cop" movie, which was supposed to star Sylvester Stallone, launched Eddie Murphy's career and in just five days, became the highest grossing winter release in Paramount's history. On August 9, 1983, Bruckheimer and Simpson struck a three-year agreement with Paramount to produce theatrical and television projects through his new Simpson/Bruckheimer Productions company. While working with Simpson, Bruckheimer became known as "Mr. Outside" because of his experience with filmmaking, while Simpson became known as "Mr. Inside" because of his film industry contacts. "The Rock (film)|The Rock" was the last film in which Bruckheimer collaborated with Simpson. After Simpson's death in 1996, Bruckheimer stipulated that "The Rock" be dedicated to the memory of Simpson.  In 1990, Bruckheimer and Simpson struck a $500 million deal with Paramount to produce five movies, entirely of their choice. However, his 1990 production of the film "Days of Thunder," which starred Tom Cruise, did not perform as well as expected, which was a step backwards in the Bruckheimer-Simpson success story. The duo made a come-back in 1994, however, with the low-budget film ($12 million) "The Ref".

Other popular films he produced include "Remember the Titans", "Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down," and the "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|Pirates of the Caribbean" series. Bruckheimer has also acquired the rights to produce a film based on the popular role playing game by Palladium Books, "Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts". In the late 1990s, he started Technical Black Films to produce non-action films, with "Remember the Titans" being the only film produced.  Since 1996, Bruckheimer has branched out into television, creating a number of police dramas of which "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" has been the most successful. He also produced the reality game show "The Amazing Race". In May 2008, CBS announced it had picked up Bruckheimer's newest series, "Eleventh Hour (U.S. TV series)|Eleventh Hour", for the 2008–2009 broadcast television season. The science fiction drama follows a government agent and a professor as they investigate strange scientific and medical activity.Adalian, Josef.  . "TelevisionWeek|TV Week", May 2008. Accessed August 27, 2009. From 2004 (beginning of "CSI: NY") to 2009 (end of "Without a Trace"), Bruckheimer had six hit television shows on the air: "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case", "Without a Trace" and "The Amazing Race". At one point, three of his TV series ranked among the top 10 in the ratings. In December 2007, Bruckheimer announced plans to partner with MTV to create a new game studio. The same year, Bruckheimer joined the ZeniMax Media board of directors and has since showed up at several launch parties for Bethesda Softworks titles, including "Fallout 3", "Fallout: New Vegas", and "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim". In 2009, Bruckheimer unveiled Jerry Bruckheimer Games, headed by former Microsoft Studios Publishing Executive Producer Jim Veevaert, as President of Production, and Jay Cohen, previously Ubisoft's Vice President of US Publishing, as President of Development. It was announced on September 10, 2009, that NBC had picked up an action procedural from Bruckheimer. The show, titled "Chase (2010 TV series)|Chase", "tells the stories of a team charged with making sure fugitive criminals don't evade justice," reports "The Hollywood Reporter". It was canceled in May 2011, however. "Skin (American TV series)|Skin", which was another Bruckheiner production, was cancelled in 2003, after only three episodes. === 2010s ...
