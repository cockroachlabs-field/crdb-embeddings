The film stars Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer and video game developer who is transported inside the software world of a mainframe computer where he interacts with programs in his attempt to escape; it also stars Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner (actor)|David Warner, Cindy Morgan, and Barnard Hughes. "Tron", along with "The Last Starfighter", has the distinction of being one of cinema's earliest films to use extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI). The inspiration for "Tron" dates back to 1976, when Lisberger became intrigued with video games after seeing "Pong". He and producer Donald Kushner set up an animation studio to develop "Tron" with the intention of making it an animated film. To promote the studio itself, Lisberger and his team created a 30-second animation featuring the first appearance of the title character. Eventually, Lisberger decided to include live-action elements with both backlit and computer animation for the actual feature-length film. Various studios had rejected the storyboards for the film before Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions agreed to finance and distribute "Tron". There, Traditional animation|backlit animation was finally combined with the computer animation and live action. "Tron" was released on July 9, 1982. The film was a moderate success at the box office, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its groundbreaking visuals and acting but criticized its storyline as being incoherent. "Tron" received nominations for Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design and Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound at the 55th Academy Awards, but was not nominated in the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects category. "Tron" spawned multiple video games (including an arcade Tron (video game)|tie-in released shortly after the film), and as it became a cult film, a multimedia franchise including comic books. A sequel titled "Tron: Legacy", directed by Joseph Kosinski, was released in 2010, with Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their roles and Lisberger acting as producer, which itself was followed by the Disney XD|XD animated series "Tron: Uprising", set between the two films. == Plot == <!-- Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Please refrain from adding unnecessary detail. --> Kevin Flynn is a leading Software|software engineer, formerly employed by the computer corporation ENCOM, who now runs a video game arcade and attempts to Security hacker|hack into ENCOM's Mainframe computer|mainframe system. However, ENCOM's Master Control Program (Tron)|Master Control Program (MCP) halts his progress. Within ENCOM, programmer Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, engineer Lora Baines, discover that the MCP has closed off their access to projects. When Alan confronts the senior executive vice president, Ed Dillinger, Dillinger claims that the security measures are an effort to stop outside hacking attempts. However, when Dillinger privately questions the MCP through his computerized desk, he realizes the MCP has expanded into a powerful virtual intelligence and has become power-hungry, illegally appropriating personal, business, and government programs to increase its own capabilities. Dillinger rose to the top of ENCOM by stealing video games Flynn had created, presenting them to the company as his own. The MCP blackmails Dillinger with information about his plagiarizing Flynn's games if he does not comply with its directives. Lora deduces that Flynn is the hacker, and she and Alan go to his arcade to warn him. Flynn reveals that he has been trying to locate evidence proving Dillinger's plagiarism, which launched Dillinger's rise in the company. Together, the three form a plan to break into ENCOM and unlock Alan's "Tron" program, a self-governing security measure designed to protect the system and counter the functions of the MCP. Once inside ENCOM, the three split up and Flynn comes into direct conflict with the MCP, communicating with his terminal. Before Flynn can get the information he needs to reveal Dillinger's acts, the MCP uses an experimental laser to digitize and upload Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe cyberspace<!-- It is a separate setting from the Grid seen in the sequel -->, where programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human "Users" (programmers) who created them. Flynn learns that the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, rule and coerce programs to renounce their belief in the Users. The MCP forces programs that resist to play in deadly Ludi|games and begins putting Flynn in duels. Flynn meets other captured programs, Ram and Tron, between matches. Partnered, the three escape into the mainframe during a light cycle match (an arcade game Flynn wrote the program for and is skilled at), but Flynn and Ram become separated from Tron by an MCP pursuit party. While attempting to help Ram, who was wounded in the pursuit, Flynn learns that he can manipulate portions of the mainframe by accessing his programmer knowledge. Ram recognizes Flynn as a User and encourages him to find Tron and free the system before "derezzing" (dying). Using his new ability, Flynn partially rebuilds a Recognizer vehicle (a construct taken from another one of Flynn's games) and later disguises himself as one of Sark's soldiers. Tron enlists help from Yori, a sympathetic program, and at an I/O tower receives information from Alan necessary to destroy the MCP. Flynn rejoins them, and the three board a hijacked solar sailer to reach the MCP's core. However, Sark's command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori and presumably killing Tron. Sark leaves the command ship and orders its deresolution, but Flynn keeps it intact by again manipulating the mainframe, while Sark reaches the MCP's core on a shuttle carrying captured programs. While the MCP attempts to absorb captive programs, Tron, who turns out to have survived, confronts Sark and critically injures him, prompting the MCP to give him all its functions. Realizing that his ability to manipulate the mainframe might give Tron an opening, Flynn leaps into the beam of the MCP, distracting it. Seeing the break in the MCP's shield, Tron attacks through the gap and destroys the MCP and Sark, ending the MCP's control over the mainframe and allowing the captured programs to communicate with users again. Flynn reappears in the real world, rematerialized at his terminal. Tron's victory in the mainframe has released all lockouts on computer access, and a nearby printer produces the evidence that Dillinger had plagiarized Flynn's creations. The next morning, Dillinger enters his office to find the MCP deactivated and the proof of his theft publicized, but is nevertheless glad that the MCP is destroyed. Subsequently, Dillinger is terminated while Flynn is promoted to CEO of ENCOM, and is happily greeted by Alan and Lora as their new boss. == Cast ==  * Jeff Bridges as List of Tron characters#Kevin Flynn|Kevin Flynn, a former programmer and video game developer at ENCOM and video arcade proprietor who is beamed into the ENCOM mainframe via a digitizing laser by the Master Control Program ** Bridges also portrays List of Tron characters#Clu|Clu (Codified Likeness Utility), a hacking program developed by Flynn to find evidence of Dillinger's theft in the mainframe. * Bruce Boxleitner as List of Tron characters#Alan Bradley|Alan Bradley, Flynn's work partner and fellow programmer at ENCOM ** Boxleitner also portrays List of Tron characters#Tron|Tron, a security program developed by Bradley to self-monitor communications between the MCP and the real world. * David Warner (actor)|David Warner as List of Tron characters#Ed Dillinger|Ed Dillinger, the Senior Executive Vice President of ENCOM and former coworker of Flynn's who used the MCP to steal Flynn's work and pass it off as his own, earning himself a series of undeserved promotions ** Warner also portrays List of Tron characters#Sark|Sark, a command program developed by Dillinger to serve as the MCP's second-in-command. ** Warner also provides the uncredited voice of the List of Tron characters#Master Control Program|Master Control Program (MCP), a rogue artificial intelligence operating system (originally a chess software|chess program created by Dr. Gibbs and "improved" by Dillinger) which monitors and controls ENCOM's mainframe. * Cindy Morgan as List of Tron characters#Lora Beines|Dr. Lora Baines, Bradley's co-worker and girlfriend, as well as assistant to Dr. Gibbs on the digitization experiment. ** Morgan also portrays List of Tron characters#Yori|Yori, an input/output program developed by Dr. Baines and an ally of Tron. * Barnard Hughes as List of Tron characters#Walter Gibbs|Dr. Walter Gibbs, a co-founder of ENCOM running the company's science division, who creates the SHV 20905 digitizing laser with Dr. Baines's assistance. ** Hughes also portrays List of Tron characters#Dumont|Dumont, a "guardian" program developed by Dr. Gibbs to protect input/output junctions in the mainframe. ** Hughes also provides the uncredited voice of the Master Control Program's original incarnation. * Dan Shor as List of Tron characters#Roy Kleinberg|Roy Kleinberg, an ENCOM employee ** Shor also portrays List of Tron characters#Ram|Ram, an actuarial program possibly developed by Kleinberg to sort out connections between ENCOM and an unnamed insurance company, who is a close ally of Tron and Flynn. * Peter Jurasik as List of Tron characters#Crom|Crom, a compound interest program matched against Flynn on the Game Grid * Tony Stephano as Peter, Ed Dillinger's assistant. ** Stephano also portrays Sark's Lieutenant. == Production ==  The inspiration for "Tron" occurred in 1976 when Steven Lisberger, then an animator of drawings with his own studio, looked at a sample reel from a computer firm called Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.|MAGI and saw "Pong" for the first time. He was immediately fascinated by video games and wanted to do a film incorporating them. According to Lisberger, "I realized that there were these techniques that would be very suitable for bringing video games and computer visuals to the screen. And that was the moment that the whole concept flashed across my mind". The film's concept of entering a parallel game world was also inspired by the classic tale "Alice in Wonderland". Lisberger had already created an early version of the character 'Tron' for a 30 second long animation which was used to promote both Lisberger Studios and a series of various rock radio stations. This backlit cel animation depicted Tron as a character who glowed yellow; the same shade that Lisberger had originally intended for all the heroic characters developed for the feature-length "Tron". This was later changed to blue for the finished film (see #Production|Pre-production below). The prototype Tron was bearded and resembled the Cylon (1978)|Cylon Centurions from the 1978 TV series "Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica". Also, Tron was armed with two "exploding discs", as Lisberger described them on the 2-Disc DVD edition (List of Tron characters#Rinzler/Tron|see Rinzler). Lisberger elaborates: "Everybody was doing backlit animation in the 70s, you know. It was that disco look. And we thought, what if we had this character that was a neon line, and that was our Tron warrior&nbsp;– Tron for electronic. And what happened was, I saw "Pong", and I said, well, that's the arena for him. And at the same time I was interested in the early phases of computer generated animation, which I got into at MIT in Boston, and when I got into that I met a bunch of programmers who were into all that. And they really inspired me, by how much they believed in this new realm."</ref& ...
