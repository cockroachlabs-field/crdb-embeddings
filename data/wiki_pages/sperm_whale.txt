It is the only living member of the Genus (biology)|genus "Physeter" and one of three extant species in the sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus "Kogia". The sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide range, and will migrate seasonally for feeding and breeding. Females and young males live together in groups, while mature males (bulls) live solitary lives outside of the mating season. The females cooperate to protect and Lactation|nurse their young. Females give birth every four to twenty years, and care for the calves for more than a decade. A mature sperm whale has few natural predators, although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by Cetacea#Social relations|pods of killer whales (orcas). Mature males average  in length, with the head representing up to one-third of the animal's length. Plunging to , it is the third deepest diving mammal, exceeded only by the southern elephant seal and Cuvier's beaked whale. The sperm whale uses Animal echolocation|echolocation and #Vocalization complex|vocalization as loud as 230 decibels (re 1 µPa m) underwater. It has the largest brain on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live 70 years or more. Spermaceti (sperm oil), from which the whale derives its name, was a prime target of the whaling industry, and was sought after for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. Ambergris, a solid waxy waste product sometimes present in its digestive system, is still highly valued as a Fixative (perfumery)|fixative in perfumes, among other uses. Beachcombers look out for ambergris as Flotsam, jetsam, lagan, and derelict#Flotsam|flotsam. Sperm whaling was a major industry in the 19th century, depicted in the novel "Moby-Dick". The species is protected by the International Whaling Commission moratorium, and is listed as Vulnerable species|vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. == Taxonomy and naming ==  The name "sperm whale" is a clipping of "spermaceti whale". Spermaceti, originally mistakenly identified as the whales' semen, is the semi-liquid, waxy substance found within the whale's head. ("See "#Spermaceti organ and melon|Spermaceti organ and melon" below.") The sperm whale is also known as the "cachalot", which is thought to derive from the archaic French for 'tooth' or 'big teeth', as preserved for example in the word  in the Gascon language|Gascon dialect (a word of either Romance languages|Romance or Basque language|Basque origin). The etymological dictionary of Joan Coromines|Corominas says the origin is uncertain, but it suggests that it comes from the Vulgar Latin  'sword hilts'.  The word "cachalot" came to English via French from Spanish or Portuguese , perhaps from Galician language|Galician/Portuguese  'big head'.Encarta Dictionary The term is retained in the Russian word for the animal,  (), as well as in many other languages. The scientific genus name "Physeter" comes from the Ancient Greek|Greek  (), meaning 'blowpipe, blowhole (of a whale)', or – as a "pars pro toto" – 'whale'. The specific name "macrocephalus" is Latinized from the Greek  ( 'big-headed'), from  () +  (). Its synonymous specific name "catodon" means 'down-tooth', from the Greek elements  ('below') and  ('tooth'); so named because it has visible teeth only in its lower jaw. ("See "#Jaws and teeth|Jaws and teeth" below.") Another synonym "australasianus" ('Australasian') was applied to sperm whales in the Southern Hemisphere.  The sperm whale belongs to the Order (biology)|order Cetartiodactyla, the order containing all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It is a member of the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, "Physeter", in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus "Kogia", the pygmy sperm whale "Kogia breviceps" and the dwarf sperm whale "K. sima", are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteroidea|Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the sperm whale family). Swedish ichthyologist Peter Artedi described it as "Physeter catodon" in his 1738 work "Genera piscium", from the report of a beached specimen in the Orkneys in 1693 and two beached in the Netherlands in 1598 and 1601. The 1598 specimen was near Berkhey. The sperm whale is one of the species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of "Systema Naturae". He recognised four species in the genus "Physeter".  Experts soon realised that just one such species exists, although there has been debate about whether this should be named "P. catodon" or "P. macrocephalus", two of the names used by Linnaeus. Both names are still used, although most recent authors now accept "macrocephalus" as the valid name, limiting "catodon" status to a lesser synonym. Until 1974, the species was generally known as "P. catodon". In that year, however, Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis proposed that the correct name should be "P. macrocephalus", the second name in the genus "Physeter" published by Linnaeus concurrently with "P. catodon". This proposition was based on the grounds that the names were synonyms published simultaneously, and, therefore, the ICZN Principle of the First Reviser should apply. In this instance, it led to the choice of "P. macrocephalus" over "P. catodon", a view re-stated in Holthuis, 1987. This has been adopted by most subsequent authors, although Schevill (1986{{cite journal |author=Schevill W.E. |year=1986 |title=The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and a paradigm – the name "Physeter catodon" Linnaeus 1758 |journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=153–157 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692. ...
