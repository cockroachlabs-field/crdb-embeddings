  The "Multinational Character Set" ("DMCS" or "MCS") is a character encoding created in 1983 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for use in the popular VT220 computer terminal|terminal. It was an 8-bit extension of ASCII that added accented characters, currency symbols, and other character glyphs missing from 7-bit ASCII.  It is only one of the code pages implemented for the VT220 National Replacement Character Set (NRCS). MCS is registered as IBM "code page/CCSID 1100" ("Multinational Emulation") since 1992. Depending on associated sorting Oracle Database|Oracle calls it "WE8DEC", "N8DEC", "DK8DEC", "S8DEC", or "SF8DEC".   Such "extended ASCII" sets were common (the National Replacement Character Set provided sets for more than a dozen European languages), but MCS has the distinction of being the ancestor of ECMA-94 in 1985 and ISO 8859-1 in 1987. The code chart of MCS with ECMA-94, ISO 8859-1 and the first 256 code points of Unicode have many more similarities than differences. In addition to unused code points, differences from ISO 8859-1 are: {|class=wikitable ! MCS code point !! Unicode mapping !!
