 In computational complexity theory|complexity theory, "UP" ("unambiguous non-deterministic polynomial-time") is the complexity class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time on an unambiguous Turing machine with at most one accepting path for each input. "UP" contains "P (complexity)|P" and is contained in "NP (complexity)|NP". A common reformulation of "NP" states that a language is in "NP" if and only if a given answer can be verified by a deterministic machine in polynomial time. Similarly, a language is in "UP" if a given answer can be verified in polynomial time, and the verifier machine only accepts at most "one" answer for each problem instance. More formally, a language "L" belongs to "UP" if there exists a two-input polynomial-time algorithm "A" and a constant "c" such that  :if x in "L" , then there exists a unique certificate "y" with <math>|y| = O(|x|^c)</math> such that  :if x is not in "L", there is no certificate "y" with <math>|y| = O(|x|^c)</math> such that  :algorithm "A" verifies "L" in polynomial time. "UP" (and its complement (complexity)|complement "co-UP") contain both the integer factorization problem and parity game problem; because determined effort has yet to find a polynomial-time solution to any of these problems, it is suspected to be difficult to show "P"="UP", or even "P"=("UP" ∩ "co-UP"). The Valiant–Vazirani theorem states that "NP" is contained in "RP"<sup>"Promise-UP"</sup>, which means that there is a randomized reduction from any problem in "NP" to a problem in "promise problem|Promise-UP". "UP" is not known to have any Complete (complexity)|complete problems. ==References==  == References == *Lane A.
