"Lower Chehalis bands or village groups" (from the Pacific coast westward inland to below the Satsop River mouth into Chehalis River; with their dependence on natural resources like Thuja plicata|cedar and fish, especially on Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon, living in compact villages composed of Plank houses they differed little from their Coast Salish neighbors of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Pacific Northwest Coast): * Copalis (on Copalis River and the Pacific Coast between the mouth of Joe Creek and Grays Harbor, in 1805, Lewis and Clark estimated a population of 200 Copalis in 10 houses, the 5 individuals assigned to a "Chepalis" tribe in an enumeration given by Olson of the year 1888 probably refers to them.
