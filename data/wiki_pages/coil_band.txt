Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician John Balance (of the band Psychic TV), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner and Psychic TV bandmate Peter Christopherson, formerly of pioneering industrial music group Throbbing Gristle. Coil's work explored themes related to the occult, sexuality, alchemy, and drugs while influencing genres such as gothic rock, neofolk and dark ambient. AllMusic called the group "one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British post-industrial music|post-industrial scene." After the release of their 1984 debut EP "How to Destroy Angels (Coil EP)|How to Destroy Angels", Coil joined Some Bizzare Records, through which they released two full-length albums, "Scatology (album)|Scatology" (1985) and "Horse Rotorvator" (1986). In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, among them the The Unreleased Themes for Hellraiser|rejected score for the first "Hellraiser" film. After departing from Some Bizzare, Coil established their own record label, Threshold House, through which they produced and released "Love's Secret Domain" (1991). Financial difficulties slowed the group's work in the early 1990s before they returned to the project on releases such as "Astral Disaster" (1999), and the "Musick to Play in the Dark" series  composed of "Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 1|Vol. 1" (1999) and "Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2|Vol. 2" (2000), as well as releasing several projects under aliases such as Black Light District, ELpH, and Time Machines.

With involvement from these members, the group also started several smaller independent vanity labels, including Eskaton and Chalice (record label)|Chalice. The group's first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004. Following the accidental death of John Balance on 13 November 2004, Christopherson formally announced that Coil as a creative entity had ceased to exist, ending the Coil discography with "The Ape of Naples" (2005). Posthumous releases and compilations of unreleased material have since followed this, with Drew McDowall and Danny Hyde leading the project's archive. ==History==   In 1978, John Balance (born Geoff Burton; also known as Rushton, by his stepfather's surname) was a teenage zine journalist, writing—along with his schoolmate Tom Craig, a grandson of Edward Carrick and grand-grandson of Edward Gordon Craig—under a moniker "Stabmental", through which he published the articles on UK underground artists, including seminal industrial music|industrial bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire.; ; . A Throbbing Gristle fan, Balance had contacted them via mail, and thus befriended the Throbbing Gristle frontperson Genesis P-Orridge.; . In February 1980, Balance had attended a Throbbing Gristle gig recorded and released as "Heathen Earth", where he had first met P-Orridge's bandmate Peter Christopherson and befriended him as well. Following the dissolution of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, P-Orridge, Christopherson, and Alex Fergusson (musician)|Alex Fergusson (formerly of Alternative TV) went on to form the new project, titled Psychic TV, along with the accompanying fellowship titled Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Balance, who had attended the University of Sussex for a short time and participated in Brian Williams' Lustmord project, returned in London to live with Christopherson—with whom a romantic partnership had begun.; . As a Psychic TV member, Balance participated in the recording of the single "Just Drifting" (from the album "Force the Hand of Chance") and, the following year, of the album "Dreams Less Sweet". Already having an experience of performing and recording previous to his tenure in Psychic TV, Balance went on to use the name Coil in 1982, originally envisioned for a solo project.; ; . In 1983, Balance wrote a manifesto titled "The Price of Existence Is Eternal Warfare" and sent a tape of the song "On Balance", dated 5 May 1982, to Gary Levermore's label Third Mind Records for an inclusion on a compilation album "Rising From The Red Sand"; Levermore, however, had rejected the track. Despite this, Balance had recorded three more new tracks—"S for Sleep", "Red Weather", and "Here to Here (Double-Headed Secret)"—on 11 May 1983.; . On 4 August 1983, Coil—as the duo of Balance and Christopherson—had played its first gig in London at the Magenta Club, during a screening of films by Cerith Wyn Evans and Derek Jarman. Since Christopherson's commitments for Psychic TV—in which he had become disillusioned due to growing conflict with P-Orridge—still limited his participation in Coil, Balance approached John Gosling (Psychic TV musician)|John Gosling—also Psychic TV member who fronted his own project Zos Kia—to work with. Balance's and Gosling's collaboration resulted in the next three gigs during 1983, with the last one being performed in December on Berlin Atonal festival, where Balance participated as both Psychic TV and Coil member. The recordings from aforementioned gigs, as well as "On Balance", were later included on Zos Kia/Coil split album "Transparent (Coil album)|Transparent", released in February 1984 by Austrian label Nekrophile Records.; ; . Since January 1984, Balance and Christopherson had departed from Psychic TV and the Temple of Psychic Youth, in order to make Coil as a full-time concern.; ; ; ; .  The band's official recording debut, an extended play titled "How to Destroy Angels (Coil EP)|How to Destroy Angels", was released on the Good Friday (20 April) of 1984 by a Belgian-based label L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords.; .

"Scatology"s themes echoed those of "How to Destroy Angels", while focusing mainly on alchemy as an idea of transforming matter.; ; .
