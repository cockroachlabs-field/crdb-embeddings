The specification ""of May"" is a reference to the May Revolution which took place in the week from 18 to 25 May 1810, which marked the beginning of the independence from the Spanish Empire for the countries that were then part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. A legend claims that as the Primera Junta|new government was proclaimed, the sun broke through the clouds, which was seen as a good omen. == Variations == In the flag of Argentina, the Sun of May is the radiant golden yellow sun bearing the human face and thirty-two rays that alternate between sixteen straight and sixteen wavy. In the flag of Uruguay, the Sun of May is the golden yellow sun bearing the human face and sixteen triangular rays that alternate between eight straight and eight wavy. Inspired by the Latin American wars of independence, the Philippines, which was a fellow former Spanish colony, also adopted the Sun of May as a Republic of Biak-na-Bato|revolutionary banner. == Description == The sun, called the Sun of May, is a replica of an engraving on Argentine real|the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813 by the Asamblea del Año XIII|Constituent Assembly, whose value was eight "" (one Spanish dollar). In form, it is similar to—and may be partially derived from—the sun in splendour, which is common in European heraldry. This, too, is usually depicted with a face, and with alternating straight and wavy rays (representing light and heat respectively), though it normally has only sixteen rays. A 1978 law describing the official ceremonial flag of Argentina specifies that the sun must be golden yellow in color (""), have an inner diameter of 10&nbsp;cm, and an outer diameter of 25&nbsp;cm (the diameter of the sun equals  the height of the white stripe, and the sun's face is  of its height), must feature 32 rays (16 undulated and 16 straight in alternation), and must be Embroidery|embroidered in the official ceremonial flag. == See also == * inti * Sun (heraldry) * Solar symbol * Vergina Sun == References ==  == External links ==    Category:National symbols of Argentina Category:National symbols of Uruguay Category:Heraldic charges Category:Coats of arms with suns Category:Inca gods Category:Solar symbols
