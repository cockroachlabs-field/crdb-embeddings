As a player, his career spanned three VFL/AFL clubs; most notably Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn where he played in three premierships. After one season with Richmond Football Club|Richmond, he then played with Footscray Football Club where he earned two Best and Fairest awards. He also achieved one All-Australian selection when representing the VFA at the 1988 National Carnival. As coach, he took the Western Bulldogs from 15th in 1996 to 3rd when he featured in the documentary "Year of the Dogs" a position in which the club held in 1997 and 1998 during which he was named coach of the All-Australian team.  Wallace's coaching style is considered to be innovative and he is credited with having started the modern practice of sides warming up on the field before a match.   However Wallace's coaching career at Richmond Football Club|Richmond between 2005 and 2009 was not so successful, and he stepped down from coaching in June 2009. His son, Brent Wallace, is currently a field umpire in the AFL. ==Playing career==  Wallace was a centreman for Hawthorn Football Club from 1978 until 1986, where he played a total number of 174 games for the club and kicked a total of 96 goals. Recruited from VFA club Camberwell Football Club|Camberwell, he was a member of Hawthorn's 1978 premiership side in what was his debut season.  Nicknamed 'Plough' for his knack of crashing through packs, Wallace was Hawthorn's best and fairest winner in 1981 and 1983, the latter in another premiership year.  He played in one further premiership side at Hawthorn in 1986.  Often polling well in the Brownlow Medal counts, Wallace finished equal third in 1982 and equal sixth in 1983.  After a contractual dispute with Hawthorn at the end of 1986, Wallace received a clearance to move to the Richmond Football Club but struggled in his only season with the club in 1987, where he played a total number of 11 games for the club and kicked a total of 7 goals. Wallace eventually ended the year prematurely with a back injury.  He finished his playing career with four seasons at Western Bulldogs|Footscray from 1988 until 1991 for a total of 69 games and kicked 20 goals, which yielded back to back Charles Sutton Medals in 1988 and 1989. ==Coaching career==  In the middle of the 1996 AFL season, he took over as the Western Bulldogs senior coach, following the sacking of incumbent senior coach Alan Joyce. At the end of the 1996 AFL season|1996 season, they finished 15th. In the 1997 AFL season|1997 season, Wallace quickly rebuilt the side, finishing third at the end of the season.  In the first qualifying final they defeated Sydney Swans|Sydney but then lost in the preliminary final to Adelaide Crows|Adelaide. In 1998 AFL season|1998, the Bulldogs under Wallace finished second at the end of the season. In the qualifying finals, they defeated the West Coast Eagles but lost in the preliminary final to Adelaide for the second year in a row. In the 1999 AFL season, Wallace led the Bulldogs to fourth at the end of the season but in the qualifying finals they lost to West Coast Eagles|West Coast then in the semi finals they lost to the Brisbane Lions. In the 2000 AFL season the Bulldogs under Wallace finished seventh but in the elimination finals they were knocked out by the Brisbane Lions.  During this season the Bulldogs were the only team to defeat  in a match that became known as the "Super-Flood" as Wallace employed "flooding" tactics against the Essendon forwards. In the 2001 AFL season, the Bulldogs under Wallace struggled and finished tenth and then the Bulldogs under Wallace kept struggling in the 2002 AFL season|2002 season, sitting at thirteenth on the ladder with eight wins, one draw and twelve losses after Round 21, 2002.  Wallace resigned as Bulldogs senior coach at the end of the 2002 season with one match left to go. Assistant coach Peter Rohde then replaced Wallace in a caretaker senior coaching role to coach the last game for the 2002 season in Round 22, 2002 against Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood, which the Bulldogs won and after this Rohde was eventually employed full-time senior coach. Wallace was linked to the Sydney Swans job in mid-2002 when Rodney Eade was sacked following a narrow round 12 loss to Geelong Football Club|Geelong. It was rumoured that there was a verbal agreement that the Swans would appoint him as their senior coach for the 2003 season.Hinds, Richard (29 August 2002)  But Wallace was not given the Swans job and it went to then-caretaker senior coach Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos, despite Wallace resigning as senior coach of the Western Bulldogs|Bulldogs with one match remaining in the 2002 season.  In August 2004, he was appointed the senior coach of Richmond Football Club|Richmond for five seasons from 2005, replacing Danny Frawley. His first year at Richmond was unsuccessful, as the club under Wallace finished twelfth at the end of the 2005 AFL season|2005 season despite spending most of the first half of the season in the top eight, mostly in the top four. In the 2006 AFL season|2006 season, Richmond under Wallace with three straight crushing defeats at the start of the season placed them at the bottom of the ladder, but they recovered to win five out of the next seven games, including a win against the Adelaide Crows, who were on top of the Australian Football League|AFL ladder at the time; but they did not make the finals, just missing out and finishing ninth at the end of the 2006 season. The 2007 AFL Season|2007 season proved to be Wallace's worst at any club. The Tigers lost the first five games of the season by less than 25 points and maintained leads in many of those games going into the final quarter. However, in Round 6, 2007, the Richmond Football Club|Tigers were soundly defeated by the eventual premiers, Geelong Football Club|Geelong, at the Telstra Dome by a record margin of 157 points.  This subsequently led to the board and management formally apologizing to supporters at Wallace's "Tuesdays with Terry" press conference.Mike Sheahan with Scott Gullan (8 May 2007)  Richmond under Wallace won only three games to finish sixteenth in last position on the ladder for the List of VFL/AFL wooden spoons|wooden spoon position at the end of the 2007 season.{{cite web|url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/114117/hall-of-fame-terry-wallace-the-plough-who-never-let-up|title=Hall of Fame: Terry Wallace, the plough who never let up|date=28 May 2018|access-da ...
