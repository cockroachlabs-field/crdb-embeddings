It is the List of cities and towns in Slovakia|fourth largest city of Slovakia with a population of approximately 80,000, an important industrial center, the largest city on the Váh river, and the seat of a "kraj" (Žilina Region) and of an "okres" (Žilina District). It belongs to the Upper Váh region of tourism. ==Etymology== The name is derived from Slavic/Slovak word "žila" - a "(river) vein". Žilina means "a place with many watercourses". Alternatively, it is a secondary name derived from Rajčanka|Žilinka river or from the name of the local people, Žilín/Žiliňane. ==History==  The area around today's Žilina was inhabited in the late Stone Age (about 20,000 BC). In the 5th century, Slavic peoples|Slavs started to move into the area. However, the first written reference to Žilina was in 1208 as "terra de Selinan". From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the middle of the 13th century, "terra Sylna" was the property of the Cseszneky|Cseszneky de Milvány family.Monumenta Hungariae historica The city started to develop around 1300, and, according to records in 1312, it was already a town. In 1321, King Charles I of Hungary|Charles I made Žilina a free royal town. On 7 May 1381, King Louis I of Hungary|Louis I issued Privilegium pro Slavis, which made the Slav inhabitants equal to the Carpathian Germans|Germans by allocating half of the seats at the city council to Slavs. The town was burned in 1431 by the Hussites. During the 17th century, Žilina gained position as a center of manufacturing, trade, and education, and, during the Baroque architecture|Baroque age, many monasteries and churches, as well as the Budatín Castle, were built. In the Revolutions of 1848, Slovak volunteers, part of the Imperial Army, won a battle near the city against Hungarian honveds and gardists. The city boomed in the second half of the 19th century as new railway tracks were built: the Košice-Bohumín Railway|Kassa Oderberg Railway was finished in 1872 and the railway to Bratislava (Pozsony in Hungarian) in 1883, and new factories started to spring up, such as the drapery factory "Slovena" (1891) and the Považie chemical works (1892). It was one of the first municipalities to sign the Martin Declaration (30 October 1918), and until March 1919, it was the seat of the Slovak government. On 6 October 1938, shortly after the Munich Agreement, the autonomy of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia was declared in Žilina. During the Holocaust in Slovakia, tens of thousands of Jews were deported from Žilina. Žilina was captured on 30 April 1945 by I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak and Red Army|Soviet troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front, after which it again became part of Czechoslovakia.  After the war, the city continued its development with many new factories, schools and housing projects being built. It was the seat of the Žilina Region from 1949 to 1960 and again since 1996. Today, Žilina is the fourth largest city in Slovakia, the third most important industrial center and the seat of a university, the University of Žilina|Žilinská univerzita (founded in 1953).
