The ship is named for Vice Admiral Lawson P. Ramage, a notable submarine commander and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. "Ramage" was Keel laying|laid down 4 January 1993 at the Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, Ship naming and launching|launched 11 February 1994, sponsored by Barbara Ramage (wife of the admiral), and Ship commissioning|commissioned 22 July 1995. ==Construction== "Ramage" was constructed utilizing efficient modular shipbuilding techniques pioneered by Ingalls in the 1970s and enhanced in recent years through the development of Product-Oriented Shipbuilding Technology (POST). Note: Quoted text has since been removed from the site. These innovative techniques allow a large ship, such as "Ramage", to be built in three separate hull and superstructure modules and later joined to form the complete ship. Heavy machinery, such as propulsion equipment, as well as piping, duct work, and electrical cabling were installed in hundreds of sub-assemblies, which were joined to form dozens of assemblies. These assemblies were then joined to form the three hull modules.  The ship's superstructure, or "deck house", was lifted atop the mid-body module early in the assembly process. "Ramage"s launching was as unique as her construction. The ship was moved over land via Ingalls' wheel-on-rail transfer system and onto the shipyard's launch and recovery drydock. The drydock was ballasted down, and DDG-61 floated free on 11 February 1994. She was then moved to her outfitting dock in preparation for the traditional christening ceremony and completion of outfitting and testing. ==Service history== On 25 November 1996, "Ramage" embarked on her maiden deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. "Ramage" visited six countries and made 16 port calls. "Ramage" was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon, the Sea Service Ribbon, and the Armed Forces Service Medal during this deployment. In March 1997 "Ramage" provided logistic and communications support for United States Marine Corps|Marines in Albania during Operation Silver Wake. On 21 July 1997, "Ramage" was an escort of the museum ship  when she set sail in Massachusetts Bay.

On 28 October 2009 while pierside at Gdynia, Poland after participating in a Joint Warrior exercise, a sailor on the ship conducting maintenance accidentally discharged one of the ship's M240 machine guns into the port city.  Two rounds from the gun's three-round burst hit a warehouse, causing no injuries, the third round was not recovered. Local police allowed the ship to depart as originally scheduled later that day after questioning the ship's crew. "Ramage" departed on deployment to the Mediterranean Sea on 5 January 2010. In late January 2010, "Ramage" was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea to assist with the search-and-rescue effort in the wake of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409.

She completed 28 Strait of Hormuz transits throughout the deployment, and returned to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia on 25 July 2016. Following her 2015–2016 deployment", Ramage" conducted her mid-cycle upgrade.
