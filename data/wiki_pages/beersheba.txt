Often referred to as the "Capital of the Negev", it is the centre of the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in Israel, the List of cities in Israel|eighth-most populous Israeli city with a population of , and the second-largest city in area (after Jerusalem), with a total area of 117,500 dunams. The biblical archaeology|Biblical site of Beersheba is Tel Be'er Sheva, lying some 4&nbsp;km distant from the modern city, which was established at the start of the 20th century by the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks. The city was captured by the British-led Australian Light Horse in the Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba during World War I.  The population of the town was completely changed in 1948–49. "Bir Seb'a" (), as it was then known, had been almost entirely Muslim and Christian, and was designated to be part of the Arab state in the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. In October 1948 it was captured by the Israel Defense Forces, and the Arab population was expelled."Guide to Israel", Zev Vilnay, Hamakor Press, Jerusalem, 1972, pp.309–14 Today, the metropolitan area is composed of approximately equal Jewish and Arab populations, but the population of the core area is almost exclusively Jewish, with a large portion of the population made up of the descendants of Sephardi Jews and Mizrahi Jews who Jewish exodus from Arab lands|immigrated from Arab countries after 1948, as well as smaller communities of Bene Israel and Cochin Jews from India. Second and third waves of immigration have taken place since 1990, bringing Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, as well as Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia. The Soviet immigrants have made the game of chess a major sport in Beersheba, and it is now Israel's national chess center, with more Grandmaster (chess)|chess grandmasters per capita than any other city in the world. , "Los Angeles Times", January 30, 2005 Beersheba is home to Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. This city also serves as a center for Science and technology in Israel|Israel's high-tech and developing technology industry. The city has constructed over 250 roundabouts, earning its moniker as the "Roundabouts Capital of the Israel" and apparently the largest number in the world. ==Etymology== The Book of Genesis gives two etymology|etymologies for the name "Be'er Sheba". Genesis 21|Genesis 21:28-31 relates:<blockquote>Then Abraham set seven ewes apart. And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What mean these seven ewes, which you have set apart? And  said, "That you are to take these seven ("sheba") ewes from me, to be for me a witness that I have dug this well ("bǝ'er")." Therefore the name of that place was Be'er Sheba, for there the two of them had sworn ("nishbǝ'u").</blockquote>Genesis 26 relates:<blockquote>And Isaac redug the wells which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had sealed after the death of Abraham, and he used the same names as had his father . . . And they arose in the morning, and they swore ("wa-yishabǝ'u") each to his fellow, and Isaac sent them off, and they departed him in peace. On that same day, Isaac's men came to him to tell him of the well which they had dug, and they said to him, "We found water." And he called it "Shib'a" ("seven" normally, possibly "oath" or a proper noun); therefore the name of the city is Be'er Sheba to this day.</blockquote>The original name could therefore relate to the oath of Abraham and Abimelech ('well of the oath') or the seven ewes in that oath ('well of the seven'), as related in , and/or to the oath of Isaac and Abimelech in .  Alternatively, Obadiah Sforno suggested that the well is called Seven because it was the seventh dug; the narrative of Genesis 26 includes three wells dug by Abraham which are reopened by Isaac (Esek, Sitnah, Rehoboth (Bible)|Rehoboth), for a total of six, after which Isaac goes to Beersheba, the seventh well. The double name of Shib'a and Beersheba is referenced again by the Masoretic Text in Book of Joshua|Joshua 19:2,David Kimhi and David Altschuler ad loc. usually translated "Beersheba or Sheba"; however the Septuagint reads "Beersheba and Samaa (Σαμαὰ)" which fits with MT 1 Chronicles|1 Chron. 4:28. Abraham ibn Ezra and Samuel ben Meir|Samuel b. Meir suggest the two etymologies refer to two different cities. During Ottoman administration the city was referred as  ("Belediye Birüsseb"). ==Hebrew Bible== Beersheba is mainly dealt with in the Hebrew Bible in connection with the Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs Abraham and Isaac, who both dig a well and close peace treaties with King Abimelech of Gerar at the site. Hence it receives its name twice, first after Abraham's dealings with Abimelech (), and again from Isaac who closes his own covenant with Abimelech of Gerar and whose servants also dig a well there (). The place is thus connected to two of the three Wife–sister narratives in the Book of Genesis. According to the Hebrew Bible, Beersheba was founded when Abraham and Abimelech settled their differences over a well of water and made a covenant (see ). Abimelech's men had taken the well from Abraham after he had previously dug it so Abraham brought sheep and cattle to Abimelech to get the well back. He set aside seven lambs to swear that it was he that had dug the well and no one else. Abimelech conceded that the well belonged to Abraham and, in the Bible, Beersheba means "Well of Seven" or "Well of the Oath". Beersheba is further mentioned in following Bible passages: Isaac built an altar in Beersheba (Genesis 26:23–33). Jacob had his dream about a stairway to heaven after leaving Beersheba. (Genesis 28:10–15 and 46:1–7). Beersheba was the territory of the tribe of Simeon and Tribe of Judah|Judah (Book of Joshua|Joshua 15:28 and 19:2). The sons of the prophet Samuel (Bible)|Samuel were judges in Beersheba (Books of Samuel|I Samuel 8:2). Saul, Israel's first king, built a fort there for his campaign against the Amalekites (I Samuel 14:48 and 15:2–9). The prophet Elijah took refuge in Beersheba when Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel ordered him killed (Books of Kings|I Kings 19:3). The prophet Amos (prophet)|Amos mentions the city in regard to idolatry (Book of Amos|Amos 5:5 and 8:14). Following the Babylonian Empire|Babylonian conquest and subsequent Babylonian captivity|enslavement of many Israelites, the town was abandoned. After the Israelite slaves returned from Babylon, they resettled the town. According to the Hebrew Bible, Beersheba was the southernmost city of the territories settled by Israelites, hence the expression "from Dan to Beersheba" to describe the whole kingdom. Zibiah, the :wikt:consort|consort of King Ahaziah of Judah and the mother of King Jehoash of Judah,2 Kings 12:1 was from Beersheba. ==History== The city has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries. Unimportant for centuries, Be’er Sheva regained importance under Byzantine rule (in the 4th–7th century), when it was a key point on the Limes Palestinae, a defense line built against the desert tribes; however, it fell to the Arabs in the 7th century and to the Turks in the 16th. It long remained a watering place and small trade centre for the nomadic Bedouin tribes of the Negev, despite Turkish efforts at town planning and development around 1900. Its capture in 1917 by the British Army opened the way for their conquest of Palestine and Syria. After being taken by Israeli troops in October 1948, Beersheba was rapidly settled by new immigrants and has since developed as the administrative, cultural, and industrial centre of the Negev. It is one of the largest cities in Israel outside of metropolitan Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa.  Human settlement in the area dates from the Chalcolithic|Copper Age. The inhabitants lived in caves, crafting metal tools and raising cattle. Findings unearthed at Tel Sheva, an archaeological site east of modern-day Beersheba, suggest the region has been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC.Z. Herzog. Beer-sheba II: The Early Iron Age Settlements. Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University and Ramot Publishing Co. Tel Aviv 1984  File:Tel Be'er Sheva Overview 2007041.JPG|thumb|Tel Sheva archaeological site	  Tel Be'er Sheva, an archaeological site containing the ruins of an ancient town believed to have been the Biblical Beersheba, lies a few kilometers east of the modern city. The town dates to the early History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israelite period, around the 10th century BCE. The site was probably chosen due to the abundance of water, as evidenced by the numerous wells in the area. According to the Hebrew Bible, the wells were dug by Abraham and Isaac when they arrived there. The streets were laid out in a grid, with separate areas for administrative, commercial, military, and residential use. It is believed to have been the first planned settlement in the region, and is also noteworthy for its elaborate water system; in particular, a huge cistern carved out of the rock beneath the town.  During the Persian rule 539 BC–c. 332 BC Beersheba was at the south of Yehud Medinata autonomous province of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. During that era the city was rebuilt{{cite encyclopedia|title=Be'er Sheva|encyclopedia=yn ...
