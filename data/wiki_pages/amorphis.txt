Initially, the band was a death metal act, but on later albums they evolved into playing other genres, including progressive metal, and folk metal. They frequently use the "Kalevala", the epic poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics. ==History==  Jan Rechberger played in a thrash metal band called Violent Solution, which Tomi Koivusaari had left in 1990 to form the death metal band Abhorrence, with Koivusaari being replaced by Esa Holopainen. Violent Solution slowly dissolved with Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen deciding to continue working with each other to form their own death metal band, Amorphis. With Rechberger having ties with Koivusaari, in early 1990, Koivusaari became the vocalist and the band also got Olli-Pekka Laine|Oppu Laine to become their bassist. During that time, Koivusaari also performed rhythm guitar, leading to the band dumping all original compositions and starting over again. Koivusaari's other band, Abhorrence, split up and he found himself with more time to put into Amorphis. A demo tape, "Disment of Soul", was recorded in 1991 by Timo Tolkki at TTT studios. It was meant to be "Dismemberment of soul" but they forgot the word "member" and so it was Disment.

Since Abhorrence was no longer active, they sent their own demo in the return mail and were signed to a worldwide recording deal. Soon after getting signed, they released their death metal debut, "The Karelian Isthmus", under the new name Amorphis and later released the "Privilege of Evil" EP. The EP featured Abhorrence's original vocalist, Jukka Kolehmainen, on vocals on the Abhorrence cover song, "Vulgar Necrolatry".  In 1994, Amorphis released their second studio album, "Tales from the Thousand Lakes", a concept album based on the Finnish national epic, the "Kalevala". This 1994 release, while still rooted in death metal, was their first step toward a new direction as melodic clean vocals were added, provided by Ville Tuomi. "Tales from the Thousand Lakes" won the band a fan base thanks to its innovative sound and fusion of death metal with traditional folk, psychedelia, and progressive elements. This album went on to influence the signature Amorphis sound.  During the subsequent tours, Martenson (keyboards) left the band, to be replaced by Kim Rantala. Rechberger was replaced by Pekka Kasari (ex-Stone (band)|Stone), and a sixth member was recruited, singer Pasi Koskinen. The third album, "Elegy (Amorphis album)|Elegy", was released in 1996. Lyrics were again adapted from Finnish mythology, in this case, the "Kanteletar", a collection of ancient folk poetry. Pasi and Tomi shared the vocals on an equal basis, with Pasi providing only clean parts. After a year and a half of touring following the release of "Elegy", the band members took a hiatus.  Their next offering, 1999's "Tuonela (album)|Tuonela", was a mellow guitar album, although toward the end of the studio sessions, Santeri Kallio of Kyyria was brought in to add some keyboard tracks to the songs. New instruments were introduced (Tomi playing sitar in the song "Greed", Sakari Kukko on saxophone and flute providing a foreign accent) and the death growls were reduced, as all vocals were performed by Pasi. The band experienced another line-up change. Following the breakup of Kyyria, Santeri joined Amorphis as a full-time member. Bassist Oppu was replaced by another ex-Kyyria member, Niclas Etelävuori, to tour with Amorphis on their third United States tour. The tenth-anniversary compilation "Story (Amorphis album)|Story" was released.  "Am Universum" was released in 2001, and included more emphasis on keyboards and saxophone work, the latter contributed by Sakari Kukko. It was an experimental album and Amorphis' most psychedelic to date.  In 2002, the band contributed to the soundtrack for the movie "Menolippu Mombasaan". The commissioned piece was a cover version of a 1976 Finnish pop hit "Kuusamo", and is currently the band's only song in their native language. The same year they started to record the band's last album with Relapse Records, "Far from the Sun". In 2003, Relapse released the retrospective "Chapters (Amorphis album)|Chapters", which included a DVD featuring the band's videos from "Black Winter Day" to "Alone". "Far from the Sun" was produced by the band itself, which had been rejoined by original drummer Jan Rechberger after Pekka Kasari had quit to concentrate on family duties. Pasi left the band in 2004 after nine years.  While searching for a new vocalist Amorphis received over a hundred demo tapes from prospective vocalists but none of them became the new frontman of the band. Eventually Tomi Joutsen got an audition through word of mouth and he became their next singer in 2005. Joutsen, best known for his work with metal band Sinisthra, urged Amorphis to return to the use of contrasting vocal styles for their next album. His first album with the band, "Eclipse (Amorphis album)|Eclipse", was released in 2006. It was a critical and commercial success, hailed as a return to form by some critics, Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=6 November 2011}} and achieving gold certification in Finland for the first time in their history. Just after Joutsen joined, Amorphis performed under name Amorjens ("aHello" in Finnish) to perform at least one gig in Finland.  Amorphis followed "Eclipse" with gigs and festival appearances throughout Europe, all the while writing new material for the follow-up. They released their next album, "Silent Waters (Amorphis album)|Silent Waters", on 3 September 2007, achieving gold certification in Finland for the second time. The album marked the first time in the history of the band that an album was recorded with the same personnel as the previous one. In support of "Silent Waters", Amorphis launched their third headlining tour in North America alongside supporting acts Samael (band)|Samael and Virgin Black.

The result of those studio sessions, "Skyforger (album)|Skyforger", was released in Finland on 27 May 2009, throughout Europe two days later, and in the United States on 16 June. Initial presses of the album had mastering errors, which prompted Nuclear Blast to issue replacement CDs. The album was certified gold in Finland on 7 July 2011, making it the third Amorphis album in a row to do so. On 20 November 2009, while touring in support of "Skyforger", Amorphis filmed a show at Club Teatria in Oulu, Finland for their first-ever live DVD. The show was released alongside another show from Summer Breeze Open Air 2009 and a documentary, titled "Tales from the 20 Years", as a part of the CD/DVD set "Forging the Land of Thousand Lakes" on 25 June 2010. On 15 September 2010, Amorphis released "Magic & Mayhem – Tales from the Early Years", a re-working of a dozen tracks from their first three albums with slightly different arrangements, better audio quality and featuring the band's current lineup, plus a cover of "Light my Fire" as a bonus track. During the tour that followed, the band briefly reunited with Pasi Koskinen and other past members (such as keyboard player Kim Rantala) on stage, to perform some of the older songs.

On 24 January 2011, the band revealed that recording was almost finished, except for vocals which would be completed at the home of producer Marko Hietala. The album "The Beginning of Times" was released on 27 May 2011 in Europe and 7 June 2011 in the United States, and features cover art by longtime collaborator Travis Smith.  On 21 August 2012, Amorphis announced on their website that a new album was in the works. On 17 January 2013, the band announced the title and release date for their next record. "Circle (Amorphis album)|Circle" was released on 19 April in Europe and 30 April in North America. Tomi Joutsen said about the new album, "Circle represents integrity. Back in the days, when there was something special to talk about, wise men used to sit in circle. Not everyone was invited to join them. But in this story, the protagonist was invited among the wise men's circle." On 16 September 2013, "Circle" won Metal Hammer's "Album of the Year" award. Esa Holopainen said about the award, "For us, Album of the Year award is a great recognition for the work done so far. Especially when we got it from our 11th studio album." On 4 August 2014, Amorphis announced on their website and through social media that they would be playing a number of special "Tales from the Thousand La ...
