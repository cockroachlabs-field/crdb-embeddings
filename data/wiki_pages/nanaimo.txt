"The Harbour City" was previously known as the "Hub City", which was attributed to its original layout design with streets radiating from the shoreline like the spokes of a wagon wheel, and to its relatively central location on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo is the headquarters of the Regional District of Nanaimo. Nanaimo is served by the Island Highway along the east coast, the BC Ferries system, and Nanaimo Airport|its regional airport. It is also on the dormant Island Rail Corridor. == History ==  The Indigenous peoples of the area that is now known as Nanaimo are the Snuneymuxw. An anglicised spelling and pronunciation of that word gave the city its current name.<!-- named when? --> The first Europeans known to reach Nanaimo Harbour were members of the 1791 Spanish voyage of Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco, under the command of Francisco de Eliza. They gave it the name "Bocas de Winthuysen" after naval officer Francisco Javier Winthuysen y Pineda. When the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) established a settlement here in 1852, they named it Colvile Town after HBC governor Andrew Colvile. In 1858 it was renamed as Nanaimo, after the local indigenous people. The city has been called "The Harbour City" since the lead-up to Expo 86.

In 1850 Snuneymuxw Chief Che-wich-i-kan, commonly known as "Coal Tyee", brought samples of coal to Victoria. A company clerk was dispatched and eventually the governor James Douglas visited the future site of Nanaimo. While open to selling coal, the Snuneymuxw wished to retain control of it and retain the exclusive right to mine it. Chief Wun-wun-shum offered to sell coal for five barrels in exchange for one blanket. The HBC representative Joseph William McKay deemed this "impertinent". The Snuneymuxw retained their rights to the resource for a while, but gradually lost them due to other tribes and miners from the failed Port Rupert project. By 1852, the first shipment of Nanaimo coal was loaded on the "Cadboro". Construction of the Nanaimo Bastion began in 1853 and was finished in 1855. On 27 November 1854, 24 coal miners and their families from England arrived at the settlement aboard the "Beaver" and "Recovery". They had travelled seven months on the ship "Princess Royal" arriving at Esquimalt two days earlier. They transferred to the two smaller vessels for the trip to Colvile Town. They were greeted by Joseph William McKay and 21 Scottish miners. During World War I, the provincial government established an Internment camp for Ukrainian detainees, many of them local, at a Provincial jail in Nanaimo. It operated from September 1914 to September 1915. In the 1940s, lumber supplanted coal as the main business. Minetown Days have been celebrated in the neighbouring community of Lantzville, British Columbia|Lantzville to highlight some of the locale's history.  – History In the late nineteenth century, numerous immigrants came from China and settled here. What was known as the first Chinatown in Nanaimo was founded during the gold rush years of the 1860s; it was the third largest in British Columbia." " (). "Nanaimo Chinatowns Project", Malaspina University-College. Retrieved on 15 February 2015. In 1884, because of mounting racial tensions related to the Dunsmuir coal company's hiring of Chinese strikebreakers, the company helped move Chinatown to a location outside city limits."" (). Vancouver Island University. Retrieved on 15 February 2015. In 1908, when two Chinese entrepreneurs bought the site and tried to raise rents, the community and 4,000 shareholders from across Canada combined forces and bought a site for the third Chinatown, at a new location focused on Pine Street. That third Chinatown burned down on 30 September 1960 but it was by then mostly derelict and abandoned. A fourth Chinatown, also called Lower Chinatown or "new town", boomed for a while in the 1920s on Machleary Street.<!-- Numbers of Chinese immigrants and residents? --> ==Location and geography== File:Namaimo aerial 4.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of downtown and central Nanaimo and adjacent islands Located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, Nanaimo is about  north-west of Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria, and  west of Vancouver, separated by the Strait of Georgia, and linked to Vancouver via the Horseshoe Bay BC Ferries terminal in West Vancouver and the Duke Point terminal to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen. As the site of the main ferry terminal, Nanaimo is the gateway to many other destinations both on the northern part of the island—Tofino, British Columbia|Tofino, Comox Valley, Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville, Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River, Port Alberni, Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park—and off its coast—Newcastle Island, Protection Island (Nanaimo)|Protection Island, Gabriola Island, Valdes Island, and many other of the Gulf Islands. Buttertubs Marsh is a bird sanctuary located in the middle of the city. The marsh covers approximately . Within this is the  "Buttertubs Marsh Conservation Area", owned by the Nature Trust of British Columbia.  Like much of coastal British Columbia, Nanaimo experiences a temperate climate with mild, rainy winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its relatively dry summers, the Köppen climate classification places it at the northernmost limits of the "Csb" or warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean zone. Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha climate classification scheme|Trewartha, place it firmly in the Oceanic climate|Oceanic zone ("Do"). Nanaimo is usually shielded from the Aleutian Low's influence by the mountains of central Vancouver Island, so that summers are unusually dry for its latitude and location— ...
