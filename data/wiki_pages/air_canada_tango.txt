 "Air Canada Tango" was a Low-cost carrier|low-cost subsidiary branch of Air Canada, which was established in 2001 to offer no-frills service on some of Air Canada's routes and to reduce operating costs at the struggling main company. Based in Toronto, Tango operated on the major longer-distance Canadian routes between cities such as Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Calgary, Alberta|Calgary and Vancouver, as well as to some holiday destinations in the United States|USA and Mexico such as Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale, Seattle, Tampa, Florida|Tampa and Mexico City. The airline's name is short for "Tan and Go", which is in reference to the southern winter destinations that it had planned to serve. ==History== The airline was launched on October 10, 2001, with tickets becoming first available for purchase on October 11, 2001. Tango commenced operations on November 1, 2001, with a fleet of Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-200 aircraft, offering fares of up to 80% off full-fare economy Air Canada fares. One innovation of Air Canada Tango was the requirement of electronic tickets, saving on ticket costs. By 2004, the airline had ceased flying. After being consolidated into Air Canada, Tango's website- "flytango.com"- redirected to Air Canada's website, but as of September 2018, is offline. Air Canada retained "Tango" as a brand name for its cheapest air fare category. Air Canada later revived the leisure-oriented "airline within an airline" concept as Air Canada Rouge in 2012, an airline that is still flying today.. aircanada.com, Retrieved 2 September 2018. ==Fleet== File:Air Canada Tango A320.jpg|thumb|An Air Canada Tango Airbus A320-200 File:Air_Canada_Tango_Boeing_737-200_Davies.jpg|thumb|An Air Canada Tango Boeing 737-200 Air Canada Tango's fleet consisted of Airbus A320-200 and Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
