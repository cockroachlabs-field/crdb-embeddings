The equivalent of Go insei in Korea is "Yeon gu saeng" (), read "Ken kyū sei" in Japanese and "Yán jiū shēng" (, also meaning "graduate student") in Chinese. == Qualifications and study == In Japan, once a year 3 or 4 apprentices who qualify in a yearly tournament become professional players.   East Asian players are required to become a professional before the age of 18 while studying as insei, but foreigners have the chance up to the age of about 30. To become an insei, a person requires a professional to sponsor them, and an application to the Nihon Ki-in.  There is no official way to contact a professional for sponsorship. While insei, many people live with their professional sponsor, who tutors and supports them. Some insei just visit their professional sponsor several times a week. The professional sponsor acts as a mentor for the insei. ==External links== *  *  *  Category:Go players|apprentice
