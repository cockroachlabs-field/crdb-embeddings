Neighboring provinces are (from south clockwise) Chanthaburi province|Chanthaburi, Chachoengsao province|Chachoengsao, Prachinburi province|Prachinburi, Nakhon Ratchasima province|Nakhon Ratchasima, and Buriram province|Buriram. To the east it borders Banteay Meanchey and Battambang province|Battambang of Cambodia. ==History== Sa Kaeo became a province in 1993, when the six districts Sa Kaeo, Khlong Hat, Wang Nam Yen, Aranyaprathet, Ta Phraya, and Watthana Nakhon of Prachinburi province were elevated to provincial status. It is thus one of the four newest provinces of Thailand, together with Amnat Charoen province|Amnat Charoen, Nong Bua Lamphu province|Nong Bua Lamphu, and most recently, Bueng Kan province|Bueng Kan. The province is overwhelmingly Theravada Buddhist (99.4 percent). In 1979 Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp was established northwest of Sa Kaeo town. It closed in 1989, but the legacy of the border clashes of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s is ever present. The largest land mine field in the world was planted along the Thai-Cambodia border according to some experts. Almost 4,000 people have been injured or killed by landmines in Thailand since the border battles—19 persons in 2017 alone. According to a survey conducted in 2001, 27 of Thailand's 76 provinces were plagued with land mines, impacting more than 530 communities and some 500,000 people. Thailand still has approximately 409&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of mined area to clear scattered around the country. With an annual clearance rate of about one km<sup>2</sup> between 2011 and 2015 the problem will not soon disappear. file:สระแก้ว สระขวัญ.jpg|left|thumb|250px|"Sa Kaeo Sa Khwan" The name "Sa Kaeo", literally 'crystal pond', refers to two ponds ("Sa Kaeo Sa Khwan") containing water thought to be sacred once used for the Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation ceremony. The name of the province originated with this place, now the ponds lie inside a public park next to Mueang Sa Kaeo Municipality Office. ==Geography== The north of the province is covered with the forested mountains of the Sankamphaeng Range and the Dangrek Mountains. The total forest area in 2021 is  or 22 percent of provincial area. To the south are the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains, which are mostly deforested.

The list of Thai provincial trees|provincial tree is "Phyllanthus emblica". The provincial flower is the Orange Jessamine ("Murraya paniculata"). The provincial slogan is "Frontier of the east, beautiful forests, splendid waterfalls, ancient civilisations, Thai-Cambodian commerce". ==Administrative divisions== Image:Amphoe Sa Kaeo.svg|thumb|Map of Sa Kaeo with 9 districts  Sa Kaeo is divided into nine districts ("Districts of Thailand|amphoe").
