His father, Abdul Karim Nasrallah, was born in Bazourieh, a village in Jabal Amel (South Lebanon|Republic of Lebanon) located near Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre and worked as a fruit and vegetables seller. Although his family was not particularly religious, Hassan was interested in theological studies. He attended the al-Najah school and later a public school in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Sin el Fil Beirut. In 1975, the Lebanese Civil War forced the family, including Nasrallah who was 15 at the time, to move to their ancestral home in Bazourieh, where Nasrallah completed his secondary education at the public school of Sour (Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre). There he attended secondary school, and briefly joined the Amal Movement, a Lebanese Shia Islam|Shi'a political group. Nasrallah studied at the Shi'a seminary in the Beqaa Valley town of Baalbek. The school followed the teachings of Iraqi-born Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, who founded the Islamic Dawa Party|Dawa movement in Najaf, Iraq during the early 1960s. -"He has lived up to our initial assessment," said an Israeli intelligence source. "He is tough, but more intellectual in a broader sense than Musawi. But he has steered close to Musawi's line and kept good relations with Amal, the Syrians, and ." The source said Nasrallah has kept an eye on making Hezbollah a legitimate political force as well as a military one. In 1976, aged sixteen, Nasrallah travelled to Iraq where he was admitted into Ayatollah al-Sadr’s seminary in Najaf. Al-Sadr is said to have recognised Nasrallah’s qualities and is quoted as saying “I scent in you the aroma of leadership; you are one of the "Ansar"  of the Mahdi ...”. Nasrallah was expelled from Iraq, along with dozens of other Lebanese students, in 1978. Al-Sadr was imprisoned, tortured and brutally murdered.David Hirst (journalist)|Hirst, David (2010) "Beware of Small States. Lebanon, battleground of the Middle East." Faber and Faber.  p.244 Nasrallah was forced to return to Lebanon in 1979, by that time having completed the first part of his study, as Saddam Hussein was expelling many Shia's, including Ruhollah Khomeini (Ayatollah Khomeini) and Abbas Musawi.Ehteshami, Anoushiravan and Raymond A. Hinnebusch, Syria and Iran - Middle Powers in a Penetrated Regional System, Routledge (1997), p. 140 Back in Lebanon, he studied and taught at the school of Amal Movement|Amal's leader Abbas al-Musawi, later being selected as Amal's political delegate in Beqaa, and making him a member of the central political office. Around the same time, in 1980, Saddam Hussein had Sadr executed. ==Early activities== Nasrallah joined Hezbollah after the 1982 Lebanon War|1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. In 1989, Hassan Nasrallah traveled to Qom, Iran, where he furthered his religious studies. Nasrallah believes that Islam holds the solution to the problems of any society, once saying, "With respect to us, briefly, Islam is not a simple religion including only prayers and praises, rather it is a divine message that was designed for humanity, and it can answer any question man might ask concerning his general and personal life. Islam is a religion designed for a society that can revolt and build a community."

Nasrallah became the leader of Hezbollah after the Israelis assassinated the previous leader, Musawi, in 1992. During Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah acquired rockets with a longer range, which allowed them to strike at northern Israel despite the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. In 1993 Israel carried out Operation Accountability. Much Lebanese infrastructure was destroyed during the operation, which Israel claimed was successful.  An agreement was eventually reached whereby, Israel ended its attacks in Lebanon and Hezbollah agreed to stop attacks on northern Israel. However, after a short pause, hostilities resumed. In 1996 Israel launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, blocking important Lebanese harbour cities and bombing a Syrian military base. After 16 days of Israeli attacks in Lebanon, the Israeli–Lebanese Ceasefire Understanding was agreed upon. Again, Hezbollah agreed to stop rocket attacks in exchange for Israel halting its attacks. However, as in 1993, the peace did not last for long. File:Hassan Nasrallah's speech in May 2000 (2).png|thumb|Nasrallah giving a speech in May 2000, just after the Israeli withdrawal In Israel, it was increasingly debated whether the presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon was working, since it was clear that the 'security zone' could not stop Hezbollah rockets reaching into Israel. After heavy Israeli casualties in south lebanon, some Israeli politicians argued that the conflict would only end if Israel withdrew from Lebanon. In 2000 Ehud Barak finally withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the Israeli withdrawal, the South Lebanon Army, which was supported by Israel, was quickly overrun by Hezbollah. Some SLA members escaped to Israel, but many were captured by Hezbollah. This success against Israel greatly increased Hezbollah's popularity within Lebanon and the Islamic world. Consequently, Nasrallah is credited in Lebanon and the Arab world for ending the South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)|Israeli occupation of the South of Lebanon, something which has greatly bolstered the party's political standing within Lebanon..
