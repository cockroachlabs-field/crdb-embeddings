It is used by the United States Navy, United States Air Force|Air Force, and United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps. The Navy C-40A variant is named "Clipper", whereas the USAF C-40B/C variants are officially unnamed. ==Design and development== The C-40 combines the Boeing 737-700 fuselage with the strengthened wings and landing gear of the larger and heavier Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-800|737-800. It also has auxiliary fuel tanks allowing an unrefueled range of up to  compared with  for the standard 737-700.

First flight took place in April 2000 and the first of the C-40A aircraft entered service in April 2001. The United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Navy Reserve was the first customer for a 737 Next Generation based "combi" aircraft (capable of transporting cargo and passengers). The Clipper was ordered by the United States Navy|U.S. Navy to replace its fleet of aging McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9B Skytrain IIs. The C-40A is the first new logistics aircraft in 17 years to join the U.S. Navy Reserve. The Navy Reserve provides all of the Navy's medium and heavy airlift capabilities. The Clipper meets or exceeds international noise and environmental requirements, which the fleet of Naval Reserve C-9s did not. It is also more fuel-efficient and offers increased range and payload capabilities. The Clipper is certified to operate in an all-passenger (121 passengers), all-cargo or combination ("combi") configuration that can accommodate up to three cargo pallets and 70 passengers on the main deck. The Navy purchased the airplanes using standard commercial practices, ordering six of the 737-700C models . The first two of four aircraft were delivered on 21 April 2001 to VR-59|Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Five Nine (VR-59) at the Naval Air Station/Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, with two more aircraft following before the end of the year. The fifth and sixth aircraft were delivered in August 2002 to VR-58 at the Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. Further aircraft have been delivered to VR-57 at the Naval Air Station North Island, California. The C-40A provides superior fuel efficiency, range and payload compared to the C-9B aircraft it replaced. In the 2018 Marine Aviation Plan, the United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps indicated that it intended to acquire two C-40A aircraft for airlift missions, replacing its Skytrain fleet. On 4 December 2018 an online notice was posted by the Marines seeking a supplier of C-40s to be delivered in 2020. The USMC Skytrains were retired in 2017 and to prepare for the transition to new aircraft, personnel from Marine Transport Squadron One were assigned to operate Navy Clippers until the arrival of their own aircraft.   File:Boeing C-40 Clipper 89aw.jpg|thumb|right|C-40B of the 89th Airlift Wing. The United States Air Force selected the "C-40B", a military version of the Boeing 737#737-700|737-700 Boeing Business Jet, to replace the aging fleet of Boeing C-137 Stratoliner|C-137 aircraft used to transport U.S. combatant commanders. The Air Force awarded the medium lift contract in August 2000. The 89th Airlift Wing acquired its first C-40B aircraft in December 2002. Both units are based at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The 15th Airlift Wing, Hickam AFB, Hawaii, acquired its C-40B for U.S. Pacific Command in February 2003. The 86th Airlift Wing, Ramstein AB, Germany, acquired its C-40B for U.S. Air Forces in Europe in December 2004. The cabin area is equipped with a crew rest area, distinguished visitor compartment with sleep accommodations, two galleys and business class seating with worktables. The C-40B is designed to be an "office in the sky" for senior military and government leaders. The aircraft features two-way broadband data communications, including secure voice and data communication; elements include internet and network access, telephones, satellites, facsimile and copy machines. The C-40B also has a computer-based passenger data system.  The C-40C is a VIP transport aircraft often used to carry members of the Cabinet and Congress. The aircraft is equipped similarly to the C-40B, but without the advanced communications capabilities. Unique to the C-40C is the capability to change its configuration to accommodate from 42 to 111 passengers. The C-40C replaced three Boeing C-22|C-22s (a militarized Boeing 727) operated by the Air National Guard and National Guard Bureau to airlift personnel. The C-40C was the first military aircraft to be acquired in this as an off-the-shelf aircraft for the Department of Defense. The 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard acquired two C-40C aircraft in October 2002.  The Air Force Reserve 932d Airlift Wing, Scott AFB, Illinois acquired three C-40C aircraft in 2007. ==Variants== File:USN C-40A Clipper.jpg|thumb|A United States Navy C-40A from Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 57, at NAS North Island ;C-40A Clipper :United States Navy version of the Boeing 737-700 for high-priority cargo and passenger transport, seventeen built. ;C-40B :United States Air Force version of the Boeing 737-700 based Boeing Business Jet modified as a special mission aircraft for commanders and government officials, four built. ;C-40C :United States Air Force version of the Boeing 737-700 based Boeing Business Jet, operational support and transport aircraft, seven built. ==Operators== ; * "United States Air Force" ** 89th Airlift Wing – Andrews AFB, Maryland  *** 1st Airlift Squadron  ** 113th Wing – Andrews AFB, Maryland  *** 201st Airlift Squadron  ** 375th Air Mobility Wing – Scott AFB, Illinois  *** 54th Airlift Squadron  ** 932d Airlift Wing – Scott AFB, Illinois  *** 73d Airlift Squadron  * "United States Navy" ** VR-51 – MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii  ** VR-56 – NAS Oceana, Virginia  ** VR-57 – NAS North Island, California  ** VR-58 – NAS Jacksonville, Florida  ** VR-59 – Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas  ** VR-61 – NAS Whidbey Island, Washington (state)|Washington  * "United States Marine Corps" ** VMR-1 – Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas ==Specifications== File:US Navy 050108-N-6954B-023 Crew members load supplies onto a C-40A Clipper aircraft assigned to the "Lone Star Express" of Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Five Nine (VR-59).jpg|thumb|right|C-40A transporting palletized humanitarian cargo, 2005.  |prime units?=kts <!-- General characteristics --> |crew=Four, five or six: Pilot, co-pilot, crew chief and loadmaster, plus one 'second loadmaster' when carrying passengers or two when carrying over 100 passengers |capacity=<br /> **C-40A passenger configuration: 121 passengers **C-40A cargo configuration: 8 pallets **C-40A combination configuration: 3 pallets, 70 passengers **C-40B: 26 to 32 passengers ** C-40C: 42 to 111 passengers **Payload:  |length ft=110 |length in=4 |length note= |span ft=112 |span in=7 |span note= |height ft=41 |height in=2 |height note= |wing area sqft= |wing area note= |swept area sqft=<!-- swing-wings --> |swept area note= |volume ft3=<!-- lighter-than-air --> |volume note= |aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes --> |airfoil="root:" BAC 449/450/451; "tip:" BAC 442 mod |empty weight lb=126000 |empty weight note= |max takeoff weight lb=171000 |max takeoff weight note= <!-- invalid parameters |max landing weight lb=134000 |max landing weight note= --> |fuel capacity= |more general= <!-- Powerplant --> |eng1 number=2 |eng1 name=CFM International CFM56-7B |eng1 type=turbofan engines |eng1 hp=<!-- prop engines --> |eng1 shp=<!-- prop engines --> |eng1 lbf=27300 |eng1 note= <!-- Performance --> |max speed kts=534 |max speed note= |max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft --> |cruise speed mph= |cruise speed note= |stall speed mph= |stall speed note= |never exceed speed mph= |never exceed speed note= |minimum control speed mph= |minimum control speed note= |range nmi=3200 |range note= (C-40A),  (C-40B/C) |combat range miles= |combat range note= |ferry range miles= |ferry range note= |endurance=<!-- if range unknown --> |ceiling ft=41000 |ceiling note= |g limits=<!-- aerobatic --> |roll rate=<!-- aerobatic --> |glide ratio=<!-- ...
