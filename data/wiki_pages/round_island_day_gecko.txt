It lives on the islet Round Island (Mauritius)|Round Island (Mauritius), and typically dwells on different palm trees. The Round Island day gecko feeds on insects and nectar. ==Etymology== The Specific name (zoology)|specific name, "guentheri", is in honor of Germany|German-born British people|British Herpetology|herpetologist Albert Günther.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. (2011). "The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles". Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . ("Phelsuma guentheri", pp. 110-111). ==Description== "P. guentheri" is one of the largest living day geckos. Males can reach a total length of about , but often are much smaller. Females of this species are generally very much smaller than males. The body color is grayish or grayish brown. A dark-brown stripe extends from the nostril to above the ear opening. On the back, dark spots may be present. In some individuals, the legs and toes have light-yellow bars. The ventral side is white or yellowish. ==Geographic range== "P. guentheri" originally occurred on Mauritius before rats and cats were introduced. Now, it inhabits only Round Island,  north-northeast of Mauritius. ==Habitat== "P. guentheri" is often found on bottle palms, fan palms ("Latania loddigesii "), and Pandanus. Since much of the original vegetation is destroyed, by tropical cyclones, "P. guentheri" is forced to live in rocky crevices. ==Diet== Round Island day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar. ==Reproduction== The females lay up to four pairs of eggs. The young will hatch after about 58–104 days. The juveniles measure . The eggs are laid normally in June, but can be laid from February to September. ==Care and maintenance in captivity== These animals are endangered and were bred and kept by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust at Durrell Wildlife Park until 1999. ==References==  ==Further reading==   *George Albert Boulenger|Boulenger GA (1885).
