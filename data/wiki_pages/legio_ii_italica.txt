"Legio II Italica" ("Italian Second Legion") was a Roman legion|legion of the Imperial Roman army. ==Formation== Originally having the "cognomen" "Pia", the legion was raised alongside Legio III Italica|III "Italica" by emperor Marcus Aurelius when legions sent from the Danube frontier to the East to take part in the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166|Parthian War could not be quickly recalled. There is good evidence to show both legions were raised in AD 165.H.M.D. Parker, "The Roman Legions" (1957), p. 116 ==Unit history== The legion's main theatre of operations was the Roman province of Noricum, in the southern margin of the Danube, where Germanic incursions were frequent. In 180 II "Italica" was stationed in Lauriacum, modern Enns (town)|Lorch.  In 193, II "Italica" marched into Rome with Septimius Severus, then fighting for power. The new emperor awarded them the title of "Fidelis" (loyal) to acknowledge their support. Later Septimius Severus would use II "Italica" against the rebellions of Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, as well as in his Parthian campaigns.  In the 3rd century, support of the Roman legion|legions was of crucial importance to candidates for the throne. Well aware of this fact, Gallienus granted II "Italica" the Cognomen|cognomina "VII Pia VII Fidelis" (seven times faithful, seven times loyal) to secure their continuing support.  There are still records of the II "Italica" in Noricum in the beginning of the 5th century. ==Symbol== The legion symbol is a Lupercal|she-wolf and the twins Romulus and Remus, a reference to the rule of Marcus Aurelius and his colleague Lucius Verus. ==See also== *List of Roman legions *Roman legion *Saint Florian == References ==  ==External links== *   Category:Roman legions|02 Italica Category:165 establishments Category:Comitatenses|02 Italica Category:History of Upper Austria Category:Military units and formations established in the 2nd century
