In 1779, it was bought back by Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who sold it to Amelungsborn Abbey in 1781. Up to the Napoleonic period, the Lord of the Manor had jurisdiction over the village. In 1844 the manor was bought by the farmers in the village and was dissolved. ==References==  ==External links== * *   Category:Towns in Lower Saxony
