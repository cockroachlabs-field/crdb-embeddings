The team was founded in 1994 to represent the port city of Fremantle, a stronghold of Australian rules football in Western Australia. The Dockers were the second team from the state to be admitted to the competition, following the West Coast Eagles in 1987. Both Fremantle and the West Coast Eagles are owned by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC), with a board of directors operating Fremantle on the commission's behalf. Despite having participated in and won several AFL finals|finals matches, Fremantle is one of only three active AFL clubs not to have won a List of VFL/AFL premiers|premiership (the others being  and ), though it did claim a McClelland Trophy|minor premiership in 2015 AFL season|2015 and reach the 2013 AFL Grand Final|2013 Grand Final, losing to . High-profile players who forged careers at Fremantle include All Australian team|All-Australian Matthew Pavlich, Australian Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame inductee Peter Bell (footballer, born 1976)|Peter Bell, and dual Brownlow Medal winner Nat Fyfe, who previously captained the club under both Ross Lyon and current head coach Justin Longmuir. Originally based at Fremantle Oval, the club's training and administrative facilities are now located nearby at Cockburn ARC in Cockburn Central, whilst its home ground is the 60,000-capacity Perth Stadium in Burswood, Western Australia|Burswood.     Fremantle has also fielded a women's team in the AFL Women's league since the competition's inception in 2017. They were coached by Trent Cooper and captained by Hayley Miller in 2022. Their most successful season was the 2020 AFL Women's season|2020 season, in which the team was undefeated, but was ultimately cancelled without a premiership awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Australian rules football in Fremantle==  {| style="margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;" |- | width=200 | "1979 WANFL Grand Final" || "G" || "B" || "Total" |- | style="text-align:left" | "East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle" || "21" || "19" || "145" |- | style="text-align:left" | South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle || 16 || 16 || 112 |- | Venue: Subiaco Oval | colspan=3 | crowd: 52,781 |} The port city of Fremantle, Western Australia has a rich footballing history, hosting the state's first organised game of Australian rules in 1881. Fremantle's first teams, the Fremantle Football Club (1882–1886)|Fremantle Football Club, the Fremantle Football Club (1882–1899)|Union/Fremantle Football Club and East Fremantle Football Club, dominated the early years of the West Australian Football League (WAFL), winning 24 of the first 34 premierships. Since 1897, Fremantle Oval has been the main venue for Australian rules football matches in the city. Until the opening of Perth Stadium in 2018, the record attendance for an Australian rules football game in Western Australia stood at 52,781 for the 1979 WANFL Grand Final between East Fremantle and South Fremantle at Subiaco Oval. Champion footballers who forged careers playing for Fremantle-based clubs include, among other Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees, Steve Marsh (footballer)|Steve Marsh, Jack Sheedy (Australian rules footballer)|Jack Sheedy, John Todd (footballer)|John Todd, George Doig, William "Nipper" Truscott|William Truscott and Bernie Naylor. <gallery mode="packed"> File:Football match Fremantle Oval 1910.jpg|Marking contest from a Fremantle Derby between South Fremantle and East Fremantle, c. 1910 File:Fremantle_Oval_1910.jpg|A view over Fremantle Oval and the surrounding buildings, c. 1910 File:George_Doig.png|East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle legend George Doig, namesake of Fremantle's Doig Medal File:Bernie_Naylor.png|South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle legend Bernie Naylor File:Fremantle Oval Statue.jpg|Statue of John Gerovich's mark over Ray French </gallery> == History ==  File:Fremantle players warming up prior to a game.jpg|thumb|Fremantle players warming up prior to a game in the club's original guernsey, 2009 Negotiations between East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle and South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle to enter into the VFL as a merged club began in 1987. However, due to an exclusive rights clause granted to the West Coast Eagles this would be impossible until the end of the 1992 season. Further applications were made by the clubs to join but their model was out of favour with the West Australian Football Commission. The AFL announced on 14 December 1993 that a new team, to be based in Fremantle, would enter the league in 1995, with the tentative name of "Fremantle Sharks." The licence cost $4 million. The names "Fremantle Football Club", "Fremantle Dockers" and the club colours of purple, red, green and white were announced on 21 July 1994. The decision to base the new club in Fremantle was primarily due to the long history of Australian rules football in Fremantle. However, it was not represented in a national club competition until 1995, eight years after the first expansion of the then Victorian Football League into Western Australia in 1987 with the creation of the West Coast Eagles. Their first training session was held on 31 October 1994 at Fremantle Oval. The team endured some tough years near the bottom of the premiership ladder, until they finished fifth after the home and away rounds in 2003 and made the finals for the first time. The elimination final against eighth-placed Essendon Football Club|Essendon at Subiaco Oval was then the club's biggest ever game, but ended in disappointment for the home team, with the finals experience of Essendon proving too strong for the young team. They then missed making the finals in the following two seasons, finishing both years with 11 wins, 11 losses and only 1 game outside the top eight. After an average first half to the 2006 AFL season, Fremantle finished the year with a club-record nine straight wins to earn themselves third position at the end of the home and away season with a club-best 15 wins. In the qualifying final against Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide at Football Park|AAMI Stadium, the Dockers led for the first three-quarters before being overrun by the Crows. The following week saw the club win its first finals game in the semi-final against Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne at Subiaco Oval. The club subsequently earned a trip to Sydney to play in its first ever preliminary final, where they lost by 35 points at Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium to the Sydney Swans.  In 2007, following Chris Connolly's resignation midway through the season, Mark Harvey, a three-time premiership player with Essendon Football Club|Essendon, was appointed caretaker coach for the club. During his seven matches for 2007, Harvey coached the Dockers to four wins and three losses. The club came 11th that year, and Harvey was appointed full-time coach at the end of the season. The following year saw the club slump to 14th. In Round 15, 2009, Fremantle recorded the lowest score in its history and of the 2000s, scoring only 1.7 (13) to the Adelaide Crows' 19.16 (130). It scored just one point in the first half and the only goal scored came in the third quarter. After finishing sixth in 2010, the club played in the finals for the first time since 2006. The team played Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn at Subiaco Oval, and despite being considered underdogs, went on to win by 30 points. The win came from strong performances from Luke McPharlin and Adam McPhee who limited the impact of Lance Franklin and Luke Hodge, respectively. The team's second ever win in a finals match qualified them for a semi-final to be played against the Geelong Cats at the MCG the following week. In a one-sided contest, the Dockers lost by 69 points. The 2011 season saw Fremantle lose just once in the first six rounds before ending the year in 11th position after losing their final seven games. Fremantle's collapse was considered a result of a heavy injury count that began in the pre-season. In September 2011, Mark Harvey was sensationally sacked by the club in favour of still-contracted St Kilda coach Ross Lyon. Fremantle qualified for the finals in 2012 after finishing in seventh position. In their elimination final against Geelong Football Club|Geelong, the Dockers won their first ever finals game away from home with a 16-point victory at the MCG behind Matthew Pavlich's six goals. Fremantle subsequently lost to the Crows in Adelaide the following week, ending their finals campaign. In 2013, Fremantle finished the home-and-away season in third position with a club-best 16 wins. In their qualifying final against the Cats in Geelong, the Dockers produced a first-round upset with a 15-point victory to advance through to a home preliminary final.{{cite news| ...
