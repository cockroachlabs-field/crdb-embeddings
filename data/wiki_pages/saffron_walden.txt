It retains a rural appearance and some buildings of the medieval period. The population was 15,504 at the 2011 census. ==History== Archaeological evidence suggests continuous settlement on or near the site of Saffron Walden from at least the Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic period. It is believed that a small Romano-British culture|Romano-British settlement and fort – possibly in the area round Abbey Lane – existed as an outpost of the much larger settlement of Great Chesterford|Cestreforda to the north. Image:Walden castle.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of 12th-century Walden Castle After the Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066, a stone church was built. Walden Castle, dating from about 1140, may have been built on pre-existing fortifications. A priory, Walden Abbey, was founded under the patronage of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex about 1136, on the site of what is now Audley End House. The abbey was separated from Walden by Holywell Field. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Sir Thomas Audley converted its cloisters into a dwelling. Later this became the site of Audley End House. Image:Cmglee Saffron Walden market square.jpg|thumb|left|The market square in July 2012, with Saffron Walden Town Hall on the right The market was moved from nearby Newport, Essex|Newport to Walden during de Mandeville's tenure, increasing the town's influence. This Tuesday market was held from 1295. The town's first charter was granted in about 1300, to what was known then as "Chepyng" (i. e. Market) Walden. The town at that time was largely confined to the castle's outer bailey, but in the 13th century the Battle or Repel Ditches were built or extended to enclose a larger area to the south. The focus of the town moved southwards to Market Square. The main trading item in medieval times was wool. A guildhall was built by the wool-staplers in the market place, but demolished in 1847 to make way for a corn exchange.   In the 16th and 17th centuries the saffron crocus ("Crocus sativus") was widely grown, thanks to the town's favourable soil and climate. The carpel|stigmas of the flower were used in medicines, as a condiment, in perfume, as an expensive yellow dye, and as an aphrodisiac. The industry gave Walden its present name. In the records of the Court of Common Pleas, the town was called Magna Walden in Hilary Term 1484, and Chipping Walden in the 15th and early 16th centuries, but by the 1540s it had become Saffron Walden. File:Cottages, Castle Street, Saffron Walden - geograph.org.uk - 950226.jpg|thumb|Castle Street contains many historic buildings  The town and surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, was strongly Puritan during the 17th century. The population was influenced by the missionary John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot. By 1640, Samuel Bass's family and a number of others had departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration.Thompson, Roger, "Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629–1640", Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994, p. 20. Saffron Walden was at the centre of the Eastern Association during the English Civil War. While the town was the headquarters of the New Model Army, Lieutenant-General of Horse, Oliver Cromwell paid a 19-day visit in May 1647, taking part in debates to seek a settlement between Parliament and the army. He is thought to have stayed at the "Sun Inn". By the end of the 18th century saffron was no longer in demand and the industry was replaced by malt and barley. More than 40 maltings stood in the town by the end of the century. The trade was less lucrative than saffron, but the town continued to grow through the 19th century, and had a cattle market, corn exchange and other civic buildings. During this time Quakers became economically active in the area. The influential Gibsons – one of the founding families of Barclays Bank – aided the construction of several public buildings that remain today, such as the Saffron Walden Museum and the Saffron Walden Town Hall. In the 1900s the Saffron Walden Railway|Saffron Walden branch railway line from Audley End railway station|Audley End station, on the mainline from London to Cambridge, was extended to Bartlow. The branch succumbed to the Beeching cuts in the 1960s. Heavy industry arrived after the Second World War. Acrows Ltd, makers of falsework, built premises to the east of the town and became a significant employer and economic influence in the area. For a short time there was a dedicated railway station for the works known as Acrow Halt railway station|Acrow Halt.  File:Saffron Walden Arms.jpg|thumb|Unofficial Arms of Saffron Walden, from a 1916 emblazonment Saffron Walden's unofficial coat of arms showed the saffron crocus within the walls of the castle in the form of an Canting arms|heraldic pun – as in, "Saffron walled-in". In 1961, a formal coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms and this was adapted in 1974 into its current form. The town has three ceremonial maces. The large mace was given to Saffron Walden by James II of England|James II in 1685 and provides an early recording of the unofficial coat of arms. Made of Silver-gilt|silver gilt, it is approximately  long. Two smaller silver maces were bought by the corporation in 1549 to commemorate the granting of a new town charter by Edward VI of England|Edward VI. This purchase is recorded in the town's Guild of Holy Trinity accounts and reads, ""For 2 new maces, weying 18 ownces one quarter and half at 8s. the ownce 7l.7s"". ==Sites and buildings of interest== Image:Saffron walden maze.jpg|thumb|200px|Saffron Walden has the largest turf maze of its type in England The 12th-century Walden Castle, built or expanded by Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville, the first Earl of Essex, is in ruins. After the medieval period, the castle fell into disuse and much of the flint was taken and used in the construction of local houses and the wall surrounding the Audley End estate. All that remains is the ruined basement. Near the castle is a turf maze, a series of circular excavations cut into the turf of the Commons|common. It is the largest example of this style of maze in England, the main part being about  in diameter. The earliest record of it dates from 1699, although its origin may be earlier. It has been extensively restored several times, most recently in 1979. The oldest inhabited building in the town is believed to be the former maltings at 1 Myddleton Place. The 15th-century building with a courtyard garden was used by the Youth Hostel Association from 1947 to 2010. It is now used for functions. "The Buildings of England#Buildings of England|Pevsner" described it as: "without doubt, the best medieval house of Saffron Walden". Other notable early buildings are in Bridge Street, Castle Street and the side streets off the High Street. The High Street contains some late-Georgian and Victorian buildings.

They have been restored with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund and volunteers.{{cite web |title=Project snapshot |url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/ourproject/Pages/Bridge_EndGarden.aspx#.U_nfV0hhtPo |website=hlf.org.uk |publisher=Heritage Lottery Fund |access-date=24 August 2014 |u ...
