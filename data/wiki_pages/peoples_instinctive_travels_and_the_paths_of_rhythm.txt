After forming the Native Tongues collective and collaborating on several projects, A Tribe Called Quest began recording sessions for "People's Instinctive Travels" in late 1989 at Calliope Studios with completion reached in early 1990. The album's laid back production encompassed a diverse range of samples which functioned as a template for the group's unorthodox lyrics. "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" was met with acclaim from professional music critics and the hip hop community on release, and was eventually certified RIAA certification|gold in the United States on January 19, 1996. Its recognition has extended over the years as it is widely regarded as a central album in alternative hip hop with its unconventional production and lyricism. It is also credited for influencing many artists in both hip hop and R&B. In a commemorative article for "XXL (magazine)|XXL", Michael Blair wrote that ""People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" was immensely groundbreaking, and will eternally maintain its relevance within the culture and construction of hip-hop". == Background == A Tribe Called Quest formed in Queens, New York City|New York, in 1985. After establishing a friendship with hip-hop act Jungle Brothers, both groups formed a collective dubbed Native Tongues, which also included De La Soul. Several years prior to recording "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm", group member Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip created much of the album's production on pause Compact Cassette|tapes when he was in the 10th grade. "Medium". Accessed on March 28, 2020. He would have his first studio experience while recording with Jungle Brothers on their debut album "Straight out the Jungle" (1988). Although this was a learning experience, he acquired more recording and producing knowledge being present at all of De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising" (1989) sessions. Audio engineer|Recording engineer Shane Faber taught Q-Tip how to use equipment such as the E-mu SP-1200 and Akai S900|Akai S950 Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers, and soon-after, renowned producer Large Professor taught him how to use other equipment, for which he would expand upon on "People's Instinctive Travels". Initially, record labels would not sign A Tribe Called Quest due to their unconventional image and sound, but took interest after the success of "3 Feet High and Rising", which featured appearances from Q-Tip. The group hired Kool DJ Red Alert as their manager, and after shopping their demo to several Record Label#major labels|major labels, they signed a contract with Jive Records in 1989. == Recording == Recording for the album began in late 1989, and finished three months later in early 1990, with "Pubic Enemy" and "Bonita Applebum" as the first tracks recorded. The group chose Calliope Studios as their primary studio, as it was renowned to promote artistic freedom. Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah and Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul with De La Soul and Stetsasonic, were all recording new music in separate rooms while A Tribe Called Quest recorded "People's Instinctive Travels". Q-Tip later commented, "It was exciting. We were kinda left to our own devices. It was just a great environment, conductive for creating. We didn't have cell phones, we didn't have the internet, we didn't have a bunch of things to tear at us. When we got to the studio, the specific job was to make music. There was no TV in there. It was all instruments and speakers. It was just music." Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed Muhammad would listen to gramophone record|records several seconds at a time, and re-work them in relationship with other records that would fit. Ali played all live instruments, scratching|DJ scratches and programming (music)|programming, while Q-Tip handled everything else with record producer|production, including sampling (music)|sampling and audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing. Although claiming that "we all helped put the album together", Q-Tip was the only group member present at every recording session. Group member Phife Dawg later admitted, "I was being ignorant on that first album, that's why I was only on a couple of tracks. I was hardly around. I would have rather hung out with my boys on the street and got my hustle on rather than gone in the studio. I wasn't even on the contract for the first album. I was thinking me and Jarobi White|Jarobi were more like back-ups for Tip and Ali, but Tip and Ali really wanted me to come through and do my thing". == Music and lyrics == "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" has been described as "a celebration of Bohemianism|bohemia, psychedelia and vagabondia", as well as "laid back". "The Los Angeles Times" described the album as consisting of "mostly happy hip-hop, featuring gently humorous, casual, conversational raps". Michael Blair from "XXL (magazine)|XXL" wrote that "the innovative production on this album created an optimal platform for the group's wildly inventive relationship with their words. From a lyrical standpoint, Tribe was both sophisticated and playful in the same breath". Much of the musical landscape on the album consisted of background noises such as a child crying, frogs and Hawaiian strings. The jazz, Rhythm and blues|R&B and Rock music|rock samples that were used were from artists that most hip-hop producers of the time ignored, or who were unfamiliar with. For the known artists that were sampled, Q-Tip used breaks that were unique for those artists, which turned out to be highly influential for hip-hop production. Ian McCann from "NME" stated "They break beats from anywhere they want ... and deliver them in an easy, totally sympathetic setting." "Entertainment Weekly"s Greg Sandow said the album "has a casual sound, something like laid-back jazz". Regarding the album's lyrics, Kris Ex from "Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork" said  "The rhymes here are at once conversational and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. The lyrics are 25 years old. But were they released today they'd seem right on time." == Critical reception ==  | rev2 = "Chicago Tribune" | rev2Score =  | rev3 = "Entertainment Weekly" | rev3Score = A− | rev4 = "NME" | rev4Score = 9/10 | rev5 = "Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork" | rev5score = 10/10 | rev6 = "Rolling Stone" | rev6score =  | rev7 = "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" | rev7score =  | rev8 = "The Source" | rev8score = 5/5 | rev9 = "Spin (magazine)|Spin" | rev9Score =  | rev10 = "The Village Voice" | rev10score = B+ }}<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot--> "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Ian McCann from "NME" wrote that "A Tribe Called Quest put no feet in the wrong place here. This is not rap, it's near perfection". "Entertainment Weekly"s Greg Sandow commented that on the album, rather than "defining Afrocentrism|Afrocentric living", the group "more or less exemplifies it with no fuss at all". Robert Tanzilo from "Chicago Tribune" stated that the album "avoids the gimmickry and circus atmosphere" of the group's contemporaries, while "focusing solely on the music". Writing for "Los Angeles Times", Dennis Hunt called the album "fascinating" and wrote "These songs lope along in a quirkly, jazz-like pace. They're intriguingly non-linear and quite provocative, even though their meaning is somewhat elusive". In an enthusiastic review, "The Source" gave it the first "The Source#The Source's Five-Mic albums|five-mic" rating in the magazine's history, and called it a "completely musical and spiritual approach to hip-hop,& ...
