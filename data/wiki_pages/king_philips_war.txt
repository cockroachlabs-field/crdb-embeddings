The war is named for Metacomet|Metacom, the Wampanoag people|Wampanoag chief who adopted the name Philip because of the friendly relations between his father Massasoit and the Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|"Mayflower" Pilgrims. The war continued in the most northern reaches of New England until the signing of the Treaty of Casco (1678)|Treaty of Casco Bay on April 12, 1678."Casco, Treaty of", by Jaime Ramon Olivares, in "The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607–1890: A Political, Social, and Military History", ed. by Spencer Tucker (ABC-CLIO, 2011) p. 134 Massasoit had maintained a long-standing alliance with the colonists. Metacom (), his younger son, became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, forsook his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists after repeated violations by the colonists.}} The colonists insisted that the 1671 peace agreement should include the surrender of Native guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged in Plymouth Colony in 1675 for the murder of another Wampanoag, which increased tensions. Native raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the colonial militia retaliated. The Narragansett people|Narragansetts remained neutral, but some Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Native allies. Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Native villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the Great Swamp Fight. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, and their coalition was taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the borders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including Providence Plantations|Providence in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Native coalition. By the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed. On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope, where he was killed by the militia. The war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history. In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.}}}} More than half of New England's towns were attacked by Natives. Hundreds of Wampanoags and their allies were publicly executed or enslaved, and the Wampanoags were left effectively landless. King Philip's War began the development of an independent American identity. The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any European government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain. ==Historical context==  Plymouth Colony was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Natives, particularly Squanto and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded Salem, Massachusetts|Salem, Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston, and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Native tribes and the colonists. The Narragansetts fought alongside the English colonists in the Pequot War and participated in the Mystic massacre but were horrified afterwards. With the defeat of the Pequots, the Narragansett leader Miantonomoh gathered groups of Algonquians together in the 1640s, in the hope that they could face the colonists together. He was captured by colonists in Connecticut and executed by the Mohegan sachem Uncas, shattering the indigenous coalition.  The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island, Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut Colony|Connecticut, and New Haven Colony|New Haven colonies each developed separate relations with the Wampanoags, Nipmucs, Narragansett people|Narragansetts, Mohegan people|Mohegans, Pequots, and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the Connecticut River valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements. The Wampanoag tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.

Metacomet became sachem of the Pokanoket and Grand Sachem of the Wampanoag people|Wampanoag Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem Wamsutta (called "Alexander" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father Massasoit (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists. The Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags. They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to Roger Williams, so Governor Josiah Winslow had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Conflict between the Wampanoags and settlers increased due to the continual intrusion of settlers' livestock onto Wampanoag farms and food stores, with extremely few colonists taking more than half-hearted steps to prevent this in spite of regular complaints by the Wampanoags. Another grievance held by many Wampanoags was the persistent attempt by colonial missionaries to convert them to Christianity; among those who expressed such grievances was Metacomet himself, who declared that he and other Wampanoag leaders possessed a great fear that any of their people "should be called or forced to be Christian Indians”. Metacomet began negotiating with the other Algonquian peoples|Algonquian tribes against the Plymouth Colony, in the winter of 1674–1675, soon after the death of his father and his brother.  The population of New England colonists totaled about 65,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine and southern New Hampshire until 1679. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all colonial New England towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them. Each town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Natives, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Native allies were found to be the most effective. The Native allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the Mohegans and Praying Indians, with about 200 warriors.Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000. By 1676, the regional Native population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), lar ...
