The other crosses are three in the vicarage garden, another in the village, another in the churchyard (its shaft is ornamented on all four sides with interlaced carving), and others at Hilltown and Newtown.Langdon, A. G. (1896) "Old Cornish Crosses". Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 386-89, 201-02, 254-55, 258-59, 405-07 The manor of St Neot was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) when it was held by Odo from Robert, Count of Mortain; it had been held by Godric the priest before 1066. The Count had taken this land away from the clergy of St Neot. There was one hide of land which never paid tax and land for 5 ploughs. There were 1 plough, 3 serfs, 3 villeins, 6 smallholders, 2 cattle, 2 pigs and 30 sheep. The value of the manor was 5 shillings though it had formerly been worth £1 sterling. The priests of St Neot had only one acre of their former land. There were 4 smallholders, 1 ox, 10 goats and 20 sheep.Thorn, C., et al., ed. (1979) "Cornwall". Chichester: Phillimore; entries 4,28; 5,14,2 During the English Civil War St Neot was staunchly Cavalier|Royalist. To commemorate this, each year on Oak Apple Day (29 May), an oak branch is mounted on the top of the church tower to symbolise the historical allegiance. John Anstis, born and buried at St Neot, was an English officer of arms and antiquarian who rose to the highest heraldic office in England and became Garter King of Arms in 1718. Henry Dangar (1796–1861) was a native of St Neot who became a surveyor and explorer of Australia. ==Parish Church of St Neot== The original dedication may have been to 'St Anietus', with whom the Saxon Neot has been confused. In the 11th century a small monastery existed here; the early medieval church building (of which the tower remains) must have been smaller than the one in existence today. Rebuilding in granite was undertaken in the 15th century and the fine stained-glass windows are from about 1500."Cornish Church Guide" (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 169-71 The stained glass is partly original and partly from a restoration done by John Hedgeland, c. 1830.Pevsner, N. "Cornwall"; 2nd ed. Penguin Books  There are 16 windows of 15th- or 16th-century workmanship unless indicated: 1: the Creation window; 2: the Noah window; 3: the Borlase window; 4: the Martyn window; 5: the Motton window; 6: the Callawy window; 7: the Tubbe and Callawy window; 8: an armorial window (Hedgeland); 9: the St George window (15th century); 10: the St Neot window (12 episodes from the legend); 11: the Young Women's window (four saints with the 20 donors below); 12: the Wives' window (Christ and three saints with the 20 donors below); 13: the Harris window; 14: the Redemption window (Hedgeland); 15: the Acts window (Hedgeland); 16: the chancel window depicts the Last Supper (Hedgeland; copied from the earliest representation in the British Museum)."Guide to South Cornwall". London, Ward, Lock, ; pp. 155–56 Nearby is the holy well of St Neot. Legend tells that the well contained three fish, and an angel told St Neot that as long as he ate no more than one fish a day, their number would never decrease. At a time St Neot fell ill, and his servant went and cooked two of the fish; upon finding this, St Neot prayed for forgiveness and ordered that the fish be returned to the well. As they entered the water, both were miraculously returned to life. ;Gallery <gallery> File:St. Neot church.jpg|The Church of St Neot, famous for its late medieval stained glass File:St Neot Cornwall 015.JPG|A stained glass window depicting St Neot (detail) File:The London Inn St. Neot Cornwall - geograph.org.uk - 101055.jpg|The London Inn </gallery> ==Other notable buildings== Two 15th-century bridges are at Pantersbridge and Treverbyn (crossing the Warleggan and River Fowey|Fowey rivers).
