In July 2006, Microsoft released the Windows version free of charge. In August 2006, Microsoft announced the Mac (computer)|Mac version would not be ported to Intel-based Macs, effectively discontinuing the product as Mac transition to Intel processors|PowerPC-based Macs would no longer be manufactured. The newest release, Windows Virtual PC, does not run on versions of Windows earlier than Windows 7, and does not officially support MS-DOS or operating systems earlier than Windows XP|Windows XP Professional SP3 as guests. The older versions, which support a wider range of host and guest operating systems, remain available. Windows Virtual PC is not supported on Windows 8 or Windows 10, and has been superseded by Hyper-V. Virtual PC virtualizes a standard IBM PC compatible device and its associated hardware. Supported Windows operating systems can run inside Virtual PC. Other operating systems such as Linux may run, but Microsoft does not provide support, or drivers (known as "Virtual Machine Additions") for these operating systems. == History == Connectix Virtual PC, Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, and Windows Virtual PC are successive versions of the same software. Windows Virtual PC only runs on Windows 7. The earlier Microsoft versions which run on older versions of Windows are still available and support operating systems older than Windows XP. Starting in Windows 8, Microsoft replaced Virtual PC with Hyper-V.  File:Virtual PC 3 for Mac OS running Windows 95.png|thumb|Connectix Virtual PC version 3 in Mac OS 9, running a Brazilian Portuguese edition of Windows 95 Virtual PC was originally developed as a Macintosh application for System 7.5 and released by Connectix in June 1997. The first version of Virtual PC designed for Windows-based systems, version 4.0, was released in June 2001. Connectix sold versions of Virtual PC bundled with a variety of guest operating systems, including Windows, OS/2, and Red Hat Linux. As virtualization's importance to enterprise users became clear, Microsoft took interest in the sector and acquired Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server|Virtual Server (unreleased at the time) from Connectix in February 2003. Virtual PC 4 requires Mac OS 8.5 or later on a G3 or G4 processor, but running Windows Me, Windows 2000 or Red Hat Linux requires Mac OS 9.0 or later. Virtual PC 4 was the first version with expandable drive images. Virtual PC 5 requires Mac OS 9.1 or newer or Mac OS X 10.1 or later.  For USB support, Mac OS X is recommended. To run Virtual PC 5 in Mac OS X, a 400&nbsp;MHz or faster CPU|processor is required. Earlier versions of Virtual PC supported the following features: (now removed in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, 2007, and Windows Virtual PC): * Older versions of Virtual PC (v5.0 or earlier) may have the hard disk formatted after creating the VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk file. Newer versions must partition and format the VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk file manually. * A "Virtual Switch" available in Virtual PC version 4.1 or earlier allows adding multiple network adapters. * Older operating systems are supported with Virtual Machine additions. * Older versions of Virtual PC for Macintosh can run on Mac OS 9.2.2 or earlier. Support of Apple System 7.5 are dropped in version 3. Under agreement with Connectix, Innotek GmbH (makers of VirtualBox, now part of Oracle Corporation|Oracle) ported version 5.0 to run on an OS/2 host. This version also included guest extensions (VM additions) for OS/2 guests, which could run on Windows, OS/2 or Mac OS X hosts using Virtual PC versions 5, 6 or 7. A new version of the guest extensions was later included with Microsoft's Virtual PC 2004.

The equivalent version for Mac, version 7, was the final version of Virtual PC for Mac. It ran on macOS|Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later for PowerPC and was a Proprietary software|proprietary commercial software product. Virtual PC 2007 was released only for the Windows platform, with public Software release life cycle|beta testing beginning October 11, 2006, and production release on February 19, 2007. It added support for x86 virtualization|hardware virtualization, "undo disks", transfer statistic monitor for disk and network, and viewing virtual machines on multiple monitors and support for Windows Vista as both host and guest. The Windows Aero interface is disabled on Windows Vista guests due to limitations of the emulated video hardware; however, Aero effects can be rendered by connecting to the guest via Remote Desktop Services from an Aero-enabled Windows Vista host, provided that the guest is running Windows Vista Business or a higher edition. "Undo disks" make it possible to revert virtual machines' state to an earlier point by storing changes into a separate <code>.vud</code> file since the last save to the main <code>.vhd</code> file, which can be used for sandbox (computer security)|experimenting. The VHD file acts as a Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot. The undo disk file (<code>.vud</code>) incrementally stores changes made by the virtual machine compared to the main Virtual hard disk drive (VHD) image, which can be applied or discarded by the user. If deactivated, changes are directly written to the VHD file. On May 15, 2008, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2007 Service Pack 1, which added support for both Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista SP1 as guest and host OSes, as well as Windows Server 2008 Standard as a guest OS. A hotfix rollup for Virtual PC 2007 SP1, released February 20, 2009, solved networking issues and enhanced the maximum screen resolution to 2048×1920 (32-bit), enabling 16:9 resolutions such as 1920×1080. A security update was released on July 14, 2009 to address an elevation of privilege vulnerability in guest operating systems. Microsoft Virtual PC (2004 and 2007) does not work at all on Windows 10 64-bit, and even on 32-bit platforms lack internet connectivity due to the lack of the VPC driver. This also impacts Windows Mobile emulators. {| class="wikitable" |+ Release dates of Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 |- ! Date !! Version !!
