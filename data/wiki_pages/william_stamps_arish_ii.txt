He was a member of the influential Farish family. == Early life == Farish was born in Mayersville, Mississippi the son of William Stamps Farish I (1843–1899) and Katherine Maude Power (1860–1931) and the grandnephew of Jefferson Davis.  He attended school at St. Thomas Hall, an Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal preparatory school at Holly Springs, Mississippi.  The school was founded in 1844 by a New Yorker, the Reverend Francis Lister Hawks (1798–1866).  A brilliant, winsome, and sometimes controversial Episcopal priest and educator, Hawks attracted motivated students from all over the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi.  Hawks's vision for the school in Holly Springs was derived in part from W.A. Muhlenberg's successful schools on Long Island.  In 1847, Hawks left Mississippi to become the first President of the University of Louisiana in New Orleans (now the Tulane University of Louisiana). == Career == After receiving a law degree from the University of Mississippi in 1900, he practiced law for three months at Clarksdale, Mississippi, before moving to Beaumont, Texas, when oil was discovered at the Spindletop oilfield.  He became supervisor of wells for Texas Oil Fields, Limited, an English syndicate.  The next year he organized the Brown-Farish Oil Company, which did contract drilling and traded in oil.  The firm became bankrupt at Brown's death, but Farish succeeded in borrowing money to pay creditors.  By 1904 Farish and Robert Lee Blaffer had formed a partnership to do contract drilling and lease trading. The next year Blaffer and Farish moved to Houston to be nearer the Humble field. In 1915, Farish became president of the Gulf Coast Producers Association and subsequently was named president of the Texas-Louisiana Oil and Gas Association. In March 1917, he and others organized the Humble Oil and Refining Company. As vice president, Farish was in charge of production, advancing industry technology and helping the company expand rapidly. In 1918, he raised the profile of Humble, serving on the Petroleum Committee of the Council for National Defense. When Humble grew short of capital for expansion, Farish turned to industry executives he had met. He negotiated with Walter Teagle, head of Standard Oil of New Jersey (later Exxon Corporation), which paid $17 million for a slight majority of Humble in 1919, and Humble gained a market for its oil and financial backing to build in Baytown, Texas one of the world's largest refineries. Farish served as vice president for five years and in 1922 became president. The Houston company, which remained surprisingly autonomous, became Jersey Standard's largest operating unit. In 1926, Farish became a founder and president of the American Petroleum Institute, taking a leadership position in oil conservation.  In 1933, he became chairman of the board of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which held substantial stock interest in Humble, and in 1937, he became president of Standard.  At the beginning of World War II, Farish was a member of the National Petroleum Industry War Council.  Farish had been a principal in a partnership between a Standard Oil/General Motors owned company, Ethyl Gasoline Corporation, and the German company I.G. Farben.  This jointly owned venture, Ethyl GmbH, was involved with the creation of the Auschwitz labor camp on June 14, 1940, to produce artificial rubber from coal and they also built then operated tetraethyllead plants in Germany.Holdermann, Karl, Im Banne der Chemie: Carl Bosch, Leben und Werk, 1954, p. 136-137 On March 25, 1942, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold announced that Farish, along with other officers of Standard Oil and related companies, pleaded "no contest" in the criminal courts of Newark, New Jersey to criminally conspiring with the Nazi government in Germany.  As part of a plea bargain, the charges were dropped in exchange for Standard Oil releasing its Germany|German patents and payment of fines totaling about $50,000.Trading With the Enemy (1983), Charles Higham: Delacorte Press, New York NY; 36 – 37 & Pp. 45 – 46  William Stamps Farish was fined $1,000 while similar fines were levied against Standard Oil -- $5,000 each  for  the parent company and for several  subsidiaries.  This did not interfere with the millions of dollars that Farish had profited as a large  stockholder, chairman  and president of Standard Oil. He was described by Senator Harry Truman in public as approaching 'treason' for profiting from the Nazi war machine and withholding patents from the US government.Trading With the Enemy (1983), Charles Higham: Delacorte Press, New York NY; 32-62   William Stamps Farish II founded Lazy F Ranch in Texas. After his death in 1942, his widow and daughter took over the running of the operation. Under Lazy F colors, Martha Gerry bred and raced a number of Thoroughbred horse racing|racehorses the most famous of which was Forego who raced between 1973 and 1978.

Libbie was a cousin of the first wife of Jefferson Davis, Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of President Zachary Taylor, and a granddaughter of Walter Browne Botts, a founder of the international law firm of Baker-Botts.  (Farish's great-grandfather, Hazelwood M. Farish (1809–1851), married Jane Lucinda Davis (1821–51), youngest sister of Jefferson Davis, President of the CSA.)
