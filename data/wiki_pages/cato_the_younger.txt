His conservative principles were focused on the preservation of what he saw as old Roman values in decline. A noted orator and a follower of Stoicism, his scrupulous honesty and professed respect for tradition gave him a powerful political following which he mobilised against powerful generals (including Julius Caesar and Pompey) of his day. Before Caesar's civil war, Cato served in a number of political offices. During his urban quaestorship in 63&nbsp;BC, he was praised for his honesty and incorruptibility in running Rome's finances. He passed laws during his tribunate in 62&nbsp;BC to expand the grain dole and force generals to give up their armies and commands before standing in elections. He also frustrated Pompey's ambitions by opposing a bill brought by Pompey's allies to transfer to Pompey the military command against the Catilinarian conspirators. He opposed, with varying success, Caesar's legislative programme during Caesar's first consulship in 59&nbsp;BC. Leaving for Cyprus the next year, he was praised for his honest administration and after his return was elected as praetor for 54&nbsp;BC. He supported Pompey's sole consulship in 52&nbsp;BC as a practical matter and to draw Pompey from his alliance with Caesar. In this, he was successful. He and his political allies advocated a policy of confrontation and brinksmanship with Caesar; though it seemed that Cato never advocated for actual civil war, this policy greatly contributed to the start of Caesar's civil war|civil war in January 49&nbsp;BC. During the civil war, he joined Pompey and tried to minimise the deaths of his fellow citizens. But after Pompey's defeat and his own cause's defeat by Caesar in Africa, he preferred to take his own life rather than beg or receive Caesar's pardon. His suicide turned him into a martyr for and a symbol of the Republic. His political influence was rooted in his moralist principles and his embodiment of Roman traditions that appealed to both senators and the innately conservative Roman voter. He was criticised by contemporaries and by modern historians for being too uncompromising in obstructing Caesar and other powerful generals. Those tactics and their success led to the creation of the First Triumvirate and the outbreak of civil war. The epithet "the Younger" distinguishes him from his great-grandfather, Cato the Elder, who was viewed by ancient Romans in similar terms as embodying tradition and propriety. ==Early life== Cato was born in 95 BC, the son of Marcus Porcius Cato (father of Cato the Younger)|his homonymous father and Livia (mother of Cato the Younger)|Livia. He was descended from Cato the Elder – this Cato's great-grandfather – who was a "novus homo" ("new man") and the first of his family to be elected to the consulship. The elder Cato was famed for his austerity and "aggressive he considered to be traditionally Roman", which was "partly a façade or political tool" and meant to embellish his reputation as "the foremost representative of the "mos maiorum"". He and his sister Porcia (sister of Cato the Younger)|Porcia were orphaned, probably before Cato was four years old, and the children were taken in by their maternal uncle, Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus. After Drusus' death and the resulting start of the Social War (91–87 BC)|Social war in 91&nbsp;BC, Cato and his sister probably came into the household of his mother's older brother, Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus. Moving in with Cato and his sister were a half-brother and two half-sisters from his mother Livia's first marriage to Quintus Servilius Caepio (quaestor 103 BC)|Quintus Servilius Caepio.. As to which Caepio, " probably was not the praetor of 91 BC who was killed at the outbreak of the Social War, but the homonymous legate who... as killed fighting the Marsi". . Cato was especially close with his half-brother, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio (brother of Cato)|Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, and his elder half-sister, Servilia (mother of Brutus)|Servilia, who would later marry Marcus Junius Brutus (tribune 83 BC)|Marcus Junius Brutus (the father of Marcus Junius Brutus|the tyrannicide) and become the mistress of Julius Caesar. Stories of Cato's early childhood are broadly unreliable and told mainly to suggest that Cato's character as an adult had been established in childhood. They include claims that Cato was a poor student whose "tenacity was in reality the result of a lack of imagination", a dubious tale that Quintus Poppaedius Silo – one of the Italian leaders during the Social war – once threatened to hang Cato out of a window unless he voiced support for Italian citizenship (Cato supposedly remained silent), and a claim that Cato asked his tutor for a sword with which to assassinate Sulla during the proscriptions.. Re Poppaedius Silo: "Cato's uncle Livius was powerful and friendly to the Italians, so it is unthinkable that his Italian guest would offer any serious threat to his family". . Around the age of 16, Cato was inducted into the "quindecimviri sacris faciundis", the board of priests in charge of consulting and interpreting the Sibylline Oracles. This was a prestigious honour, for which he was likely selected on the initiative of his uncle Mamercus Lepdius, and it introduced Cato "to a powerful circle of influential senators". ==Political development== File:Marcus Porcius Cato.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Statue of Cato the Younger in the Louvre|Louvre Museum. He is about to kill himself while reading the "Phaedo", a dialogue of Plato which describes the death of Socrates. The statue was begun by Jean-Baptiste Roman (Paris, 1792–1835) using white Carrara marble. It was finished by François Rude (Dijon, 1784 – Paris, 1855). Shortly after his induction into the "quindecimviri", he received his inheritance, which immediately made him a wealthy citizen (though modest among the elite). Plutarch reports around this time, he also began to study Stoicism under the philosopher Antipater of Tyre, Epicureanism under a Philostratus, and Peripatetism under a certain Demetrius. His education in popular oratory and rhetoric was "highly unusual for a student of Stoic philosophy", implying that philosophy was only one part of his wider education.  He also started to adopt an pattern of ostentatious public antiquarianism. To that end, he adopted an austere lifestyle where he refused to travel long distances on horseback (preferring to walk), travelled the city barefoot, and wore only a toga without a tunic. His sartorial choices were modelled on statues of Rome's legendary founders and heroes, who were depicted wearing togas alone, rather than any philosophical inclinations. These choices were deliberate and political:  }} File:Curia Hostilia, Comitium, Rostra and Lapis Niger layout.jpg|thumb|The "basilica Porcia" was a small building to the left of the "curia Hostilia" (in red) in the Roman Forum raised by Cato's great-grandfather. It was Rome's first basilica; it burnt down in 52&nbsp;BC. His first appearance on the public stage was to oppose changes to the Basilica Porcia, a public building commissioned by his great-grandfather Cato the Elder during his term as Roman censor|censor in 184&nbsp;BC. The plebeian tribunes proposed moving a column that impeded their view of the Roman Forum|Forum. Cato may have been expected to defend the monument – "public buildings such as the Basilica Porcia were prized heirlooms that perpetuated a family's fame and greatness, so men could be expected to defend their family monuments" – but the column may not have actually been part of the Basilica. Regardless, Cato used the opportunity to enter public life with an appearance defending his family's honour and reputation, showing his "pietas", and connecting himself to his famous ancestor.  Cato's first marriage was early in his twenties. He was first betrothed to his cousin Aemilia Lepida (a daughter of Mamercus Lepidus). The reasons were unclear: because of his close relations to Mamercus Lepidus, the match would not have been very useful politically in building new alliances; he may have been motivated by love or by the large size of the dowry. Aemilia Lepida had previously been betrothed to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica, but Scipio broke off the match, after which Cato was betrothed. However, some time later, Scipio changed his mind and Lepidus evidently decided that a match with Scipio was more desirable. The two were married shortly after. Cato was angry and threatened a lawsuit against his uncle to enforce the engagement, but was dissuaded by his friends. He instead married Atilia, the daughter of an Atilius Serranus (the specific identity is unknown). While the "gens Atilia" had consular ancestors, it had not been successful in reaching the consulship after the end of the second century&nbsp;BC.. According to the "Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic", the last Atilius to reach the consulship during the republic was Gaius Atilius Serranus in 106&nbsp;BC. Atilia may have been that Atilius' daughter. By her, he later had a son, Marcus Porcius Cato (son of Cato the Younger)|Marcus Porcius Cato, and a daughter, Porcia (wife of Brutus)|Porcia. Around this time he also secured an excellent marriage for his sister in Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. His half-sisters' very favourable matches helped develop a strong network of political allies.  In 72&nbsp;BC, Cato volunteered to fight in the Third Servile War|war against Spartacus, presumably to support his half-brother Caepio, who was serving as a military tribune in the consular army of Lucius Gellius. Although the army was defeated twice in battle, Cato's valour was recognised. Although the consul Gellius recommended Cato for awards, he publicly declined them and "advertised that his standards for military accomplishment were much more stringent than the consul's, and the strangeness of this act was so shocking that it was talked about and remembered back in Rome". A few years later, in 67&nbsp;BC, he stood for the Military tribune|military tribunate. After winning election, he was dispatched to Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia under propraetor Marcus Rubrius, where he earned the respect of the soldiers by sharing their burdens and treating them justly. He also maintained his "unusual habit of walking everywhere instead of riding a horse". Over a winter, he travelled to Pergamum and became the patron of a Greek Stoic philosopher named Athenodoros Cordylion|Athenodorus who, contradicting Cato the Elder's "famous position against Greek philosophers", accompanied Cato back to Rome. During his service in Macedonia, he received the news that his beloved half-brother Caepio was ill and dying in Thrace. He immediately went to see him but was unable to arrive before his brother's death. Cato was overwhelmed by grief and, ignoring Stoic principles of "apatheia" (living w ...
