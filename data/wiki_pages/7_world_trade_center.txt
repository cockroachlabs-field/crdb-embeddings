The original structure, part of the World Trade Center (1973–2001)|original World Trade Center, was completed in 1987 and was destroyed in the September 11 attacks in 2001. The current structure opened in May 2006. Both buildings were developed by Larry Silverstein, who holds a ground rent|ground lease for the site from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The original  Trade Center was  tall, clad in red granite masonry, and occupied a trapezoidal footprint. An elevated walkway spanning Vesey Street connected the building to the World Trade Center plaza. The building was situated above a Consolidated Edison power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants. Salomon Brothers signed a long-term lease in 1988 and became the anchor tenant of . On September 11, 2001, the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapsed. The debris ignited fires on multiple lower floors of the building, which continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the afternoon. The building's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires. The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered Cascading failure#Cascading structural failure|cascading failure of nearby columns throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5:20:33&nbsp;pm. This initiated progressive collapse of the entire building at , according to Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA, while the 2008 NIST study placed the final collapse time at . The collapse made the old 7 World Trade Center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires. Construction of the new  Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The building is  tall (plus one underground floor), making it the List of tallest buildings in New York City|28th-tallest in New York. It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, and is bounded by Greenwich, Vesey Street|Vesey, Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington, and Barclay Streets on the east, south, west, and north, respectively. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current building's design emphasizes safety, with a reinforced concrete core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing on steel columns. It also incorporates numerous Sustainable design|green design features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the council's pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS). ==<span class="anchor" id="Original building"></span>Original building (1987–2001)== <!--7 World Trade Center#Original building is linked from Template:World Trade Center-->    File:FEMA 403 - Ch5 WTC7 - (Fig 5-5) 3D diagram showing relation of trusses and transfer girders.svg|left|thumb|300x300px|Transfer trusses used on the 5–7th floors to redistribute load to the foundation The original 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was a 47-story building, designed by Emery Roth|Emery Roth & Sons, with a red granite facade. The building was  tall, with a trapezoidal footprint that was  long and  wide. Tishman Realty & Construction managed construction of the building. The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted on October 2, 1984. The building opened in May 1987, becoming the seventh structure of the World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center. 7 World Trade Center was constructed above a two-story Consolidated Edison|Con Edison electrical substation|substation that had been located on the site since 1967. The substation had a caisson (engineering)|caisson foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25&nbsp;stories containing . However, the final design for 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built. The structural design of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders, located between floors&nbsp;5 and 7, to transfer loads to the smaller foundation. Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the 7th floor,  the building's structure was a typical Tube (structure)|tube-frame design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames. A shipping and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern quarter of the 7&nbsp;World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. The spray-on fireproofing for structural steel elements was gypsum-based Monokote, which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and trusses, and a three-hour rating for columns. Mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven, including 12&nbsp;transformers on the 5th floor. Several Emergency power system|emergency generators installed in the building were used by the New York City Emergency Management|New York City Office of Emergency Management, Salomon Brothers|Salomon Smith Barney, and other tenants. In order to supply the generators, 24,000&nbsp;gallons (91,000&nbsp;L) of diesel fuel were stored below ground level. Diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing|World Trade Center bombings of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani#Preparedness|Rudy Giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7&nbsp;World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized in light of the events of September 11 attacks|9/11, the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse. Each floor had  of rentable office space, which made the building's floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the city.{{cite news |last=Horsley |first=Carter B |title=Lower Manhattan Luring Office Developers |work=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 25, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/realestate/lower-manhattan-luring-office-developers.html |access-date=February 17, 2008 |archive-date=August 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/202108 ...
