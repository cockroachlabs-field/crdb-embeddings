The band renamed itself The Tourists, adding bassist Eddie Chin and drummer Jim Toomey. Coombes played guitar, sang and wrote most of the Tourists' original songs.

Coombes moved to London and did not perform during most of the 1980s. In 1992 he moved to Cornwall and created the band Diminished Responsibility with amateur producer and bassist Andy Brown, his wife Cathy and with Dave Farghally on drums. The band did not release any recordings. In the 1990s his health deteriorated and by late 1996 he could no longer perform. He died in 1997 due to cirrhosis of the liver related to long term heavy consumption of alcohol. He was 45 years old. Coombes' sons Chester P|Joey and Farma G|Robin Coombes formed the hip hop group Task Force (band)|Task Force. ==References==  ==External links== *    Category:1952 births Category:1997 deaths Category:English rock guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:English new wave musicians Category:English songwriters Category:People from Sunderland Category:Musicians from Tyne and Wear Category:20th-century English musicians Category:20th-century British guitarists Category:20th-century British male musicians Category:The Tourists members Category:Deaths from cirrhosis Category:Alcohol-related deaths in England Category:British male songwriters
