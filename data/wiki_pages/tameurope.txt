In 1942 a site outside the city was set up to manufacture aircraft parts. To maintain production under allied air attacks, some of the plant was in tunnels.  Some 17,146 vehicles, known as TAM Pionir, were produced during the next fifteen years. The majority were flatbed trucks, but a number of fire engines, buses and other vehicles were also produced. TAM's first model, the Praga RN|TAM Pionir, was built under license from the Czechoslovak company Praga (company)|Praga, and was manufactured until 1962, with a total of 17,416 produced in that period. TAM quickly became Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia's leading truck manufacturer. In 1958, it began manufacturing vehicles under license from the Germany|German company Magirus|Magirus-Deutz. In 1961, the company was renamed to "Tovarna Avtomobilov in Motorjev Maribor" (""Maribor Automobile and Engine Factory""), however the TAM acronym and logo were retained. At its height, it employed more than 8,000 workers; however, the economic decline of the 1980s saw financial difficulties, and in 1996 the company was dissolved. TAM was succeeded by TVM (Tovarna vozil Maribor – translated: Maribor Vehicle Factory) in 2001, producing MAN SE|MAN trucks under license primarily for the Slovenian Army.
