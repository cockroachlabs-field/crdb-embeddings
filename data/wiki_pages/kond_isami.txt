However, the Authentication|authenticity of his "Kotetsu" is highly debatable.

After suffering a gunshot wound at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in January 1868, Kondō returned to Edo. There he met with the military commander Katsu Kaishū and was promoted to the rank of wakadoshiyori ("wakadoshiyori-kaku" 若年寄格) in the rapidly disintegrating Tokugawa administration. Kondō created a new unit, , based on the surviving remnants of the Shinsengumi and led them under the alias of "Okubo Tsuyoshi". They departed from Edo for Kōfu Castle on March 24 on orders to suppress uprisings there. Upon receiving news on March 28 that Kōfu Castle had been taken by Imperial Court (Japan)|Imperial Court forces led by Itagaki Taisuke, they settled at a town of Katsunuma five miles east of Kōfu. On March 29, 1868, Kondō and his unit were attacked by the Imperial forces at the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma, holding out for about two hours but ultimately losing. They narrowly escaped from the battle and retreated to Edo. On April 11, 1868, Kondō, Hijikata and their unit departed Edo again and set up temporary headquarters at the Kaneko family estate, northeast of Edo. Kondō later changed his alias from Okubo Tsuyoshi to "Okubo Yamato". Later on April 25, 1868, they moved to a new headquarters in Nagareyama, Chiba|Nagareyama. ==Execution== While training at Nagareyama on April 26, 1868, Kondo and his unit were caught by surprise by Imperial forces. The Vice-chief of Staff Arima Tota of Satsuma Domain suspected that "Okubo Yamato" was Kondō himself, and ordered him brought back to the Imperial forces camp at Koshigaya. Kondō was then taken to Itabashi on April 27, 1868, for questioning. On the same day Hijikata went to Edo to see Katsu Kaishū and asked for his help in getting a pardon for Kondō. The following day, April 28, a messenger arrived at Itabashi with a letter seemingly written by Katsu requesting that Kondō's life be spared. However, the messenger was arrested and the request was denied. Kondō was put on trial on April 30, 1868 and declared guilty. As a result, Kondō was beheaded by the executioner Yokokura Kisoji at the Itabashi execution grounds on May 17, 1868.Kojima, p.91 Among the crowd witnessing his execution was his nephew Miyagawa Yūgorō. Kondō's head was put on a pike for public display. Three days later on May 20, 1868, Kondō's body was claimed by his nephew to be taken back to Osawa, Edo to be buried, while his head was salted and moved to Kyoto, where it was displayed on a pike on Sanjō Ōhashi. While on display on the bridge, Kondō's head was taken away by Saitō Hajime, who would later ask the priest Sonku Giten to hold a memorial service for him. The head was taken by the priest when he moved to Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture, and buried in a small mound behind the Hozoji temple. According to Tani Tateki (1837–1911) of the Tosa Domain, Kondō was arrested and executed by the new government (formed mostly by samurai from Chōshū Domain|Chōshū han and Satsuma domain|Satsuma han) as a direct result of being accused of the assassination of Sakamoto Ryōma.  Tani continued to insist that Kondō was responsible for the killing even after former Mimawarigumi member Imai Nobuo confessed in 1870. ==Grave memorials== File:Grave of Isami Kondo.JPG|thumb|Kondo Isami's memorial grave in Aizu Kondō has at least four grave sites; it is believed that the first of them was the grave erected at Ten'nei-ji Temple (天寧寺) in Aizu by Hijikata Toshizō.
