He won the Anton Rubinstein Prize when he was just nine years old. He studied with Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna from 1904 to 1908, then joined his own family in England, making his English debut at Reading in 1908, his London debut the following year. While in Dublin during the war he met another Leschetizky student, Mabel Lander, and they began plans to establish a piano school together in London that would use the Leschetizky method. But the plans had to be abandoned due to Moiseiwitsch's increasingly heavy international concert schedule. He toured the United States (first in 1919), Australia, India, Japan, and South America. Moiseiwitsch was invited by Director Josef Hofmann to teach at the Curtis Institute of Music in 1927. He settled in England and took British citizenship in 1937. Moiseiwitsch was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1946 for services to music during the Second World War, having performed hundreds of recitals for servicemen and charities. He married Daisy Kennedy, an Australian concert violinist, and had two daughters, Sandra and the set designer, Tanya Moiseiwitsch. He and his second wife Anita had a son, noted New Zealand National Radio broadcaster Boris Moiseiwitsch. He was a friend of Nikolai Medtner and commissioned the Piano Concerto No. 3 (Medtner)|Piano Concerto No. 3 "Ballade" (1940–43). Like his friend Mark Hambourg he was a member of the Savage Club.Summers, Jonathan. , Naxos CD (2007) 8.558107–10 He was also a skilled Wrestling|wrestler, and arranged several friendly matches with the critic Ralph Hill (music critic)|Ralph Hill, also a wrestling enthusiast.Palmer, Russell. "British Music" (1947), p. 167 ==Playing style== Moiseiwitsch was particularly knownJean-Pierre Thiollet, "88 notes pour piano solo", Neva Editions, 2015, "Solo nec plus ultra", p. 52. for his interpretations of the late Romantic repertoire, especially the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff (who was an admirer of his playing and referred to Moiseiwitsch as his "spiritual heir"Sergey Prokofiev, "Diaries 1907–1914: Prodigious Youth", Cornell University Press (2008), p. 470.) and Robert Schumann, whose piano music gave Moiseiwitsch "more emotional and spiritual satisfaction than anyone else."Benno Moiseiwitsch, "On playing the piano and Robert Schumann", BBC broadcast (1959), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FYYFRBVCik At the piano, Moiseiwitsch was noted for his elegance, poetry, lyrical Musical phrasing|phrasing, brilliance, rhythmic freedom, and relaxed virtuosity. He made recordings for His Master's Voice (now EMI) starting in the 78 rpm record#Speeds|78RPM shellac era, continuing with long-playing records and into the early stereo era. His distinctive style can be heard in his recording of Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" and the Barcarolle (Chopin)|Barcarolle, Ballade No. 4 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 4 and Nocturne, Op. 62 of Frédéric Chopin. In 1950 critic and musicologist Irving Kolodin said about the Ballade in F minor of Chopin played by Moiseiwitsch: "A featherweight touch in the opening section of this work, an apt feeling for its "once upon a time" narrative quality give Moiseiwitsch pre-eminence among present day interpreters...", thus summing up the sensitivity of the playing by Benno Moiseiwitsch.Irving Kolodin, The New Guide To Recorded Music, Doubleday (publisher), New York, 1950 He worked meticulously and amicably as a chamber musician, including in Rachmaninoff's "Trio Élégiaque" and Cello Sonata (Rachmaninoff)|Cello Sonata in G minor. American critic Harold C. Schonberg praised Moiseiwitsch's formidable technique and free approach to the music, adding that such freedom was "always tempered by impeccable musicality."Harold C. Schonberg, "The Great Pianists from Mozart to the Present", Simon & Schuster, Second Edition (1987) ==Discography== A comprehensive list of Moiseiwitsch's discography does not exist, but much of his recorded output is available on CD.
