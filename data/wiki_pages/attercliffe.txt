The "cliff" can be seen in front of the church. The name Attercliffe can be traced back as far as an entry in the Domesday|Domesday Book -Ateclive- meaning at the cliffe, a small escarpment that lay alongside the River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don. This cliff can be seen in images from the 19th century, but is no longer visible.J. Edward Vickers, "The Ancient Suburbs of Sheffield", pp.7&ndash;10 (1971) Westforth or Washford Bridge, at the Sheffield end of the village, was first recorded in a will of 1535. It was rebuilt in wood in 1608 and 1647, then in stone in 1672, 1789 and 1794.G. R. Vine, "" (pt. 2) Historically a part of the Sheffield Cathedral|parish of Sheffield, Attercliffe Chapel was built in 1629 as the first place of worship in the settlement. The Town School was built in 1779, and Christ Church was built in 1826 but destroyed during the Second World War. In 1686, Richard Frankland (tutor)|Richard Frankland set up a dissenting academies|dissenting academy at Attercliffe Hall. Three years later, it was taken over by the Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist minister Timothy Jollie, who educated students including John Bowes, 1st Baron Bowes|John Bowes, Nicholas Saunderson and Thomas Secker."", "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" Secker, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was frustrated by Jollie's poor teaching, famously remarking that he lost his knowledge of languages and that 'only the old Philosophy of the Schools was taught there: and that neither ably nor diligently. The morals also of many of the young Men were bad. I spent my time there idly & ill'.Manuscript autobiography In the early 19th century, Attercliffe remained a rural community known for its orchards, windmill, and large houses including the Old Hall, New Hall and Carlton House. New Hall was later converted into pleasure gardens, with a cricket ground, racecourse, bowling green, maze, lake and depictions of famous cities. It was known for its concerts and firework displays. Small-scale manufacture of pen knife and pocket knife developed in the early 19th century, The suburb became more accessible with the construction of first a Turnpike trust|turnpike road from Sheffield to the terminus of the River Don Navigation at Tinsley, South Yorkshire|Tinsley, then the opening of the Sheffield Canal, running to the south of the village. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a frequent proposal to widen this to form a Sheffield Ship Canal, to terminate in a basin at Attercliffe.G. R. Vine, "" (pt. 3) Attercliffe railway station opened in August 1871 and closed on 26 September 1927. File:John Banner Attercliffe.jpg|thumb|right|The former John Banner department store Attercliffe has long been an industrial area, but by the early 20th century, there was also a large residential population and high class shops, John Banner's department store (Banner's) in particular. The area declined after the Second World War as Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|Victorian housing was cleared which was not replaced, causing schools to close, followed by most of Attercliffe's shops, while some of the local industries closed or moved to larger sites further out of Sheffield.

Don Valley Stadium was demolished in 2013, but other entertainment venues bring visitors to the area, including Hollywood Bowl & Cineworld. This has changed Attercliffe from its previous seedy element to an area for outer city entertainment with the introduction of Valley Centertainment.
