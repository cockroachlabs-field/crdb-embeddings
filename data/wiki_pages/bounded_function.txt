 Image:Bounded and unbounded functions.svg|right|thumb|A schematic illustration of a bounded function (red) and an unbounded one (blue). Intuitively, the graph of a bounded function stays within a horizontal band, while the graph of an unbounded function does not. In mathematics, a function (mathematics)|function "f" defined on some Set (mathematics)|set "X" with real number|real or complex number|complex values is called "bounded" if the set of its values is bounded set|bounded. In other words, there exists a real number "M" such that  :<math>|f(x)|\le M</math> for all "x" in "X". A function that is "not" bounded is said to be "unbounded". If "f" is real-valued and "f"("x") ≤ "A" for all "x" in "X", then the function is said to be "bounded (from) above" by "A". If "f"("x") ≥ "B" for all "x" in "X", then the function is said to be "bounded (from) below" by "B". A real-valued function is bounded if and only if it is bounded from above and below. An important special case is a "bounded sequence", where "X" is taken to be the set "N" of natural numbers. Thus a sequence "f" = ("a"<sub>0</sub>, "a"<sub>1</sub>,  "a"<sub>2</sub>, ...) is bounded if there exists a real number "M" such that :<math>|a_n|\le M</math> for every natural number "n". The set of all bounded sequences forms the sequence space <math>l^\infty</math>. The definition of boundedness can be generalized to functions "f : X → Y" taking values in a more general space "Y" by requiring that the image "f(X)" is a bounded set in "Y". == Related notions == Weaker than boundedness is local boundedness. A family of bounded functions may be Uniform boundedness|uniformly bounded.  A bounded operator "T : X → Y" is not a bounded function in the sense of this page's definition (unless "T = 0"), but has the weaker property of "preserving boundedness": Bounded sets "M ⊆ X" are mapped to bounded sets "T(M) ⊆ Y." This definition can be extended to any function "f" : "X" → "Y" if "X" and "Y" allow for the concept of a bounded set. Boundedness can also be determined by looking at a graph. ==Examples== * The sine function sin : "R" → "R" is bounded since <math>|\sin (x)| \le 1</math> for all <math>x \in \mathbf{R}</math>. * The function <math>f(x)=(x^2-1)^{-1}</math>, defined for all real "x" except for −1 and 1, is unbounded. As "x" approaches −1 or 1, the values of this function get larger in magnitude. This function can be made bounded if one restricts its domain to be, for example, . * The function <math display="inline">f(x)= (x^2+1)^{-1}</math>, defined for all real "x", "is" bounded, since <math display="inline">|f(x)| \le 1</math> for all "x". * The inverse trigonometric function arctangent defined as: "y" =  or "x" =  is monotonic function|increasing for all real numbers "x" and bounded with −|2}} < "y" < |2}} Radian|radians * By the boundedness theorem, every continuous function on a closed interval, such as "f" :  → "R", is bounded. More generally, any continuous function from a compact space into a metric space is bounded. *All complex-valued functions "f" : "C" → "C" which are Entire function|entire are either unbounded or constant as a consequence of Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem. In particular, the complex sin : "C" → "C" must be unbounded since it is entire. * The function "f" which takes the value 0 for "x" rational number and 1 for "x" irrational number (cf. Nowhere continuous function#Dirichlet function|Dirichlet function) "is" bounded. Thus, a function Pathological (mathematics)|does not need to be "nice" in order to be bounded. The set of all bounded functions defined on  is much larger than the set of continuous functions on that interval. Moreover, continuous functions need not be bounded; for example, the functions <math>g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}</math> and <math>h: (0, 1)^2\to\mathbb{R}</math> defined by <math>g(x, y) := x + y</math> and <math>h(x, y) := \frac{1}{x+y}</math> are both continuous, but neither is bounded. (However, a continuous function must be bounded if its domain is both closed and bounded.) ==See also== * Bounded set * Support (mathematics)#Compact support|Compact support *Local boundedness * Uniform boundedness == References ==   Category:Real analysis Category:Complex analysis Category:Types of functions
