The other family is the Tachyglossidae, or echidnas.  Within the Ornithorhynchidae are the genus|genera "Monotrematum", "Obdurodon", and "Ornithorhynchus": *Family Ornithorhynchidae **Genus † "Monotrematum"  ***†"Monotrematum sudamericanum" **Genus †"Obdurodon" — an ancient branch of the platypus family ***†"Obdurodon dicksoni" ***†"Obdurodon insignis" ***†"Obdurodon tharalkooschild" **Genus "Ornithorhynchus" ***"Ornithorhynchus anatinus" (the modern platypus) ***†"Ornithorhynchus maximus" Another two genera, "Steropodon" and "Teinolophos", were originally thought to belong to the Ornithorhynchidae. However, they were both placed into a new family, the Steropodontidae. This decision was made based on differences in the dentary recovered from the Griman Creek Formation, Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. This dentary is the holotype for the genus "Steropodon",  thus the lack of information led to the original misclassification. Further research on "Teinolophos" has indeed shown it to be an animal much different from ornithochrynchids, lacking a beak, possessing a more complete mammalian dentition, and retaining primitive ears connected to the jaw as in more basal mammals.Thomas H.

In 2022 it was proposed to move "Steropodon" into its own family, Teinolophidae. The extinct "Ornithorhynchus maximus" has been included in "Ornithorhynchus", but later placed with the echidna family Tachyglossidae as "Zaglossus robustus". ==References==    *     Category:Ornithorhynchidae|  Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray Category:Extant Selandian first appearances
