Carnivorous Plant Database. }} The "Venus flytrap" ("Dionaea muscipula") is a carnivorous plant native to humid subtropical climate|subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina. It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs (called "trigger hairs" or "sensitive hairs") on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if another contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. Triggers may occur with a tenth of a second of contact. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption. "Dionaea" is a monotypic genus closely related to the waterwheel plant ("Aldrovanda vesiculosa") and sundews ("Drosera"), all of which belong to the family Droseraceae. Although widely cultivated for sale, the population of the Venus flytrap has been rapidly declining in its native range. The species is currently under Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act review by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. ==Etymology== The plant's common name (originally "Venus's flytrap") refers to Venus (mythology)|Venus, the Roman goddess of love. The genus name, "Dionaea" ("daughter of Dione (mythology)|Dione"), refers to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, while the species name, "muscipula", is Latin for both "mousetrap" and "flytrap". The Latin word  ("mousetrap") is derived from Mus (subgenus)|"mus" ("mouse") and  ("trap"), while the homonym word  ("flytrap") is derived from  ("fly") and . Historically, the plant was also known by the slang term "tipitiwitchet" or "tippity twitchet", possibly an oblique reference to the plant's resemblance to human female genitalia. The term is similar to the term tippet-de-witchet which derives from tippet and witchet (archaic term for vagina). In contrast, the English botanist John Ellis (naturalist)|John Ellis, who gave the plant its scientific name in 1768, wrote that the plant name tippitywichit was an indigenous word from either Cherokee language|Cherokee or Catawba people|Catawba. The plant name according to the "Handbook of American Indians" derives from the Carolina Algonquian language|Renape word "titipiwitshik" ("they (leaves) which wind around (or involve)"). ==Discovery== On 2 April 1759, the North Carolina List of colonial governors of North Carolina|colonial governor, Arthur Dobbs, penned the first written description of the plant in a letter to English botanist Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson. In the letter he wrote: "We have a kind of Catch Fly Sensitive which closes upon anything that touches it. It grows in Latitude 34 but not in 35. I will try to save the seed here." A year later, Dobbs went into greater detail about the plant in a letter to Collinson dated Brunswick, 24 January 1760.  – Venus Flytrap  This was the first detailed recorded notice of the plant by Europeans. The description was before John Ellis (naturalist)|John Ellis' letter to "The London Magazine" on 1 September 1768, and his letter to Carl Linnaeus on 23 September 1768, in which he described the plant and proposed its English name "Venus's Flytrap" and scientific name "Dionaea muscipula".: Together with a Catalogue of Such Foreign Plants as Are Worthy of Being Encouraged in Our American Colonies, for the Purposes of Medicine, Agriculture, and Commerce. To Which is Added, the Figure and Botanical Description of a New Sensitive Plant, Called Dionæa muscipula: or, Venus's Fly-trap – (London, printed and sold by L. Davis, 1770). == Description == The Venus flytrap is a small plant whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object. Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year; longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than seven leaves are Colony (biology)|colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground. File:Drawing of Venus Flytrap.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration from "Curtis's Botanical Magazine" by William Curtis (1746–1799) The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable Petiole (botany)|petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are li ...
