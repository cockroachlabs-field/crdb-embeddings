This plot synopsis is written chronologically. --> A young Bruce Wayne and Andrea Beaumont begin a relationship after meeting while visiting their respective parents' graves. During this time, Bruce makes his first attempts at crime-fighting. While he succeeds in foiling robberies, he is discouraged that the criminals do not fear him. Bruce becomes conflicted about whether to commit to his relationship with Andrea or defend Gotham City to avenge his parents, but eventually he proposes marriage. Andrea accepts, only to mysteriously leave Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending the engagement in a Dear John letter. Heartbroken, Bruce assumes the mantle of Batman. Ten years later, Batman breaks up a meeting of Gotham Organized crime|crime bosses led by Chuckie Sol. When Sol tries to escape in his car, a cloaked figure, the Phantasm, causes him to speed out of control and fatally crash into a building. Witnesses  see Batman at the scene, and it is believed that he killed Sol. A city councilman, Arthur Reeves, who is corrupt and on the mob's payroll, vows to have Batman arrested.  The Phantasm murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the Gotham Cemetery. Bronski's bodyguards see Phantasm and mistakenly believe it's Batman. Batman investigates the scene of Bronski's death and encounters Andrea, inadvertently revealing his identity to her. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski, and a third gangster, Salvatore Valestra, later finding a photograph of the four together in Valestra's home. Paranoid that Batman will come for him next, the now-elderly Valestra asks Reeves for help, but he is refused. In desperation, he turns to the Joker (character)|Joker. The Phantasm goes to kill Valestra at his mansion, only to find him dead from exposure to Joker's venom. Seeing the Phantasm through a camera, Joker realizes Batman is not the murderer and detonates a bomb he planted in the mansion. The Phantasm escapes the blast and is pursued by Batman but disappears, leaving Batman ambushed by the police but saved from arrest by Andrea. She later explains to Bruce that her father embezzlement|embezzled money from Valestra and was forced to repay it; Valestra then demanded he pay more and put a Contract killing|hit on Carl, prompting him to go into hiding with Andrea. While Bruce considers resuming his relationship with Andrea, he concludes that Carl Beaumont is the Phantasm. However, Bruce takes another look at the photo of Carl and Valestra, and he recognizes one of Valestra's men as the Joker. Joker presses Reeves for information, believing him to be behind the Phantasm in order to erase his mob connections, before poisoning him with venom which drives Reeves insane. Reeves is taken to the hospital, where he is interrogated by Batman, confessing that while previously working as Carl's accountant, he helped the Beaumonts escape, but he revealed  their location to Valestra in exchange for funding his first city council campaign. Both Batman and Joker deduce that the Phantasm is Andrea, who intends to wipe out the Valestra mob for killing her father and robbing her of a future with Bruce. Andrea tracks down Joker, her father's killer, to his hideout in Gotham's abandoned World's Fair. They fight but are interrupted by Batman, who begs Andrea to stop, to no avail. Joker prepares to blow up the fair but is seized by Andrea, who bids Batman goodbye as the explosives detonate. Batman survives the blast but finds no trace of either Andrea or the Joker.  Bruce is later consoled by Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred in the Batcave, who assures him Andrea could not have been helped, before finding Andrea's locket containing a picture of them together. A sorrowful Andrea departs Gotham and a saddened Batman, cleared of the accusations against him, resumes crimefighting. ==Voice cast== * Kevin Conroy as Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman * Mark Hamill as Joker (character)|The Joker  * Dana Delany as Andrea Beaumont|Andrea Beaumont / The Phantasm ** Stacy Keach (who also voices Carl Beaumont) provided the voice for The Phantasm while masked.  * Hart Bochner as Arthur Reeves  * Stacy Keach as Carl Beaumont  * Abe Vigoda as Sal "The Wheezer" Valestra * Dick Miller as Chuckie Sol * John P.

The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and face a kangaroo court in which the villains try him for making them what they are. The idea's concept, however, was considered "too brainy", as it required Batman to be immobile for a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode "Trial", which was aired after the film's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television series' regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head." Members of the creative team have claimed that they did not intend for the Joker to appear in the film; Paul Dini has contradicted this, stating that the Joker's role was always part of the story from the beginning of the film's production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film, as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film "Batman (1989 film)|Batman", but writer Michael Reaves said, "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action." In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent "Animated Series" writer Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously used in the episodes "Joker's Wild" and "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne". Aiding Burnett in writing the script were Martin Pasko, who handled most of the flashback segments; Reaves, who wrote the climax (narrative)|climax; and Dini, who claims he "filled in holes here and there". The film's plot was heavily influenced by the 1987 miniseries "Batman: Year Two", written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Alan Davis, Paul Neary, Alfredo Alcala, Mark Farmer and Todd McFarlane. Orson Welles' 1941 classic "Citizen Kane" served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time. According to Kevin Conroy, Andrea Beaumont was named after voice director Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano. The character of Hazel, the cook robot of the World of the Future Fair, was named by Burnett after Hazel the Maid (portrayed by Academy Award-winning actress Shirley Booth), "The Saturday Evening Post" protagonist of cartoonist Ted Key's TV series "Hazel (TV series)|Hazel". On the other hand, the design of the Phantasm went into 20 different versions until one was found which convinced the film's crew. According to Burnett, the Phantasm was like the Death (personification)|Grim Reaper with a cape, although the idea was to make him resemble the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come of Charles Dickens' novel "A Christmas Carol",{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydv8TS2wids| archive-url= https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211115/Ydv8 ...
