He is considered one of the foremost painters in 19th-century America and a preeminent figure in American art. Largely self-taught, Homer began his career working as a commercial illustrator.Poole, Robert M. . "Smithsonian Magazine". April 2008. Retrieved May 22, 2008. He subsequently took up oil painting and produced major studio works characterized by the weight and density he exploited from the medium. He also worked extensively in watercolor, creating a fluid and prolific oeuvre, primarily chronicling his working vacations.Cooper, Helen A., "Winslow Homer Watercolors", p. 16. Yale University Press, 1986. ==Early life== File:Joseph E. Baker - Portrait of Winslow Homer at the age of twenty-one (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Winslow Homer at the age of twenty-one Born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1836, Homer was the second of three sons of Charles Savage Homer and Henrietta Benson Homer, both from long lines of New Englanders. His mother was a gifted amateur watercolorist and Homer's first teacher. She and her son had a close relationship throughout their lives. Homer took on many of her traits, including her quiet, strong-willed, terse, sociable nature; her dry sense of humor; and her artistic talent.Cooper, p. 16. Homer had a happy childhood, growing up mostly in then-rural Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was an average student, but his art talent was evident in his early years. Homer's father was a volatile, restless businessman who was always looking to "make a killing." When Homer was thirteen, Charles gave up the hardware store business to seek a fortune in the California gold rush. When that failed, Charles left his family and went to Europe to raise capital for other get-rich-quick schemes that did not pay off.Elizabeth Johns, "Winslow Homer: The Nature of Observation", University of California Press, Berkeley, 2002, p. 9, . After Homer's high school graduation, his father saw a newspaper advertisement and arranged for an apprenticeship. Homer's apprenticeship at the age of 19 to John Henry Bufford|J. H. Bufford, a Boston commercial lithography|lithographer, was a formative but "treadmill experience".;  (stating age at time of apprenticeship as 18) He worked repetitively on sheet music covers and other commercial work for two years. By 1857, his freelance career was underway after he turned down an offer to join the staff of "Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly". "From the time I took my nose off that lithographic stone," Homer later stated, "I have had no master, and never shall have any."Johns (2002), p. 13. Homer opened his own studio in Boston. Homer's career as an illustrator lasted nearly twenty years. He contributed illustrations of Boston life and rural New England life to magazines such as "Ballou's Pictorial" and "Harper's Weekly" at a time when the market for illustrations was growing rapidly and fads and fashions were changing quickly. His early works, mostly commercial wood engravings of urban and country social scenes, are characterized by clean outlines, simplified forms, dramatic contrast of light and dark, and lively figure groupings—qualities that remained important throughout his career.Cikovsky (1990), p. 12 His quick success was mostly due to this strong understanding of graphic design and also to the adaptability of his designs to wood engraving. Before moving to New York in 1859, Homer lived in Belmont, Massachusetts, with his family. His uncle's Belmont mansion, the 1853 Homer House, was the inspiration for a number of his early illustrations and paintings, including several of his 1860s croquet pictures. The Homer House, owned by the Belmont Woman's Club, is open for public tours.  ==Homer's studio== File:Winslow Homer - Prisoners from the Front - The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|"Prisoners from the Front" (1866; Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). In 1859, he opened a studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City, the artistic and publishing capital of the United States. Until 1863, he attended classes at the National Academy of Design, and studied briefly with Frédéric Rondel, who taught him the basics of painting.Cooper, p. 13. In only about a year of self-training, Homer was producing excellent oil work. His mother tried to raise family funds to send him to Europe for further study but instead "Harper's" sent Homer to the front lines of the American Civil War (1861–1865), where he sketched battle scenes and camp life, the quiet moments as well as the chaotic ones.Cikovsky (1990), p. 15. His initial sketches were of the camp, commanders, and army of the famous Union officer, Major General George B. McClellan, at the banks of the Potomac River in October 1861. File:Winslow Homer - Long Branch, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|"Long Branch, New Jersey" (1869; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Although the drawings did not get much attention at the time, they mark Homer's expanding skills from illustrator to painter. As with his urban scenes, Homer illustrated women during wartime, and showed the effects of the war on the home front. The war work was dangerous and exhausting. Back at his studio, Homer would regain his strength and re-focus his artistic vision. He set to work on a series of war-related paintings based on his sketches, among them "Sharpshooter on Picket Duty" (1862), "Home, Sweet Home" (1863), and "Prisoners from the Front" (1866).Cikovsky (1990), p. 16. He exhibited paintings of these subjects every year at the National Academy of Design from 1863 to 1866. "Home, Sweet Home" was shown at the National Academy to particular critical acclaim; it was quickly sold and the artist was consequently elected an Associate Academician, then a full Academician in 1865. During this time, he also continued to sell his illustrations to periodicals such as "Our Young Folks" and "Frank Leslie's Chimney Corner". After the war, Homer turned his attention primarily to scenes of childhood and young women, reflecting nostalgia for simpler times, both his own and the nation as a whole. File:Winslow Homer - Crossing the Pasture.jpg|thumb|"Crossing the Pasture" (1871–72; Amon Carter Museum of American Art). File:A Visit from the Old Mistress.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|"A Visit from the Old Mistress" (1876; Smithsonian American Art Museum). Homer was also interested in postwar subject matter that conveyed the silent tension between two communities seeking to understand their future. His oil painting "A Visit from the Old Mistress" (1876) shows an encounter between a group of four freed slaves and their former mistress. The formal equivalence between the standing figures suggests the balance that the nation hoped to find in the difficult years of Reconstruction. Homer composed this painting from sketches he had made while traveling through Virginia. Near the beginning of his painting career, the 27-year-old Homer demonstrated a maturity of feeling, depth of perception, and mastery of technique which was immediately recognized. His realism was objective, true to nature, and emotionally controlled. One critic wrote, "Winslow Homer is one of those few young artists who make a decided impression of their power with their very first contributions to the Academy ... He at this moment wields a better pencil, models better, colors better, than many whom, were it not improper, we could mention as regular contributors to the Academy." And of "Home, Sweet Home" specifically, "There is no clap-trap about it. The delicacy and strength of emotion which reign throughout this little picture are not surpassed in the whole exhibition." "It is a work of real feeling, soldiers in camp listening to the evening band, and thinking of the wives and darlings far away. There is no strained effect in it, no sentimentality, but a hearty, homely actuality, broadly, freely, and simply worked out." ==Early landscapes and watercolors== File:Winslow Homer - Artists Sketching in the White Mountains.jpg|thumb|left|"Artists Sketching in the White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains" (1868; Portland Museum of Art, Portland, Maine). Before exhibiting at the National Academy of Design, Homer finally traveled to Paris, France, in 1867 where he remained for a year. His most praised early painting, "Prisoners from the Front", was on exhibit at the Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle in Paris at the same time. He did not study formally but he practiced landscape painting while continuing to work for "Harper's", depicting scenes of Parisian life. Homer painted approximately one dozen small paintings during the stay. Although he arrived in France at a time of new fashions in art, Homer's main subject for his paintings was peasant life, showing more of an alignment with the established French Barbizon school and the artist Jean-François Millet|Millet than with newer artists Édouard Manet|Manet and Gustave Courbet|Courbet. Though his interest in depicting natural light parallels that of the early Impressionism|impressionists, there is no evidence of direct influence as he was already a En plein air|plein-air painter in America and had already evolved a personal style which was much closer to Manet than Monet. Unfortunately, Homer was very private about his personal life and his methods (even denying his first biographer any personal information or commentary), but his stance was clearly one of independence of style and a devotion to American subjects. As his fellow artist Eugene Benson wrote, Homer believed that artists "should never look at pictures" but should "stutter in a language of their own."Cikovsky (1990), pp. 32, 42. Throughout the 1870s, Homer continued painting mostly rural or idyllic scenes of farm life, children playing, and young adults courting, including "Country School" (1871) and "The Morning Bell" (1872). In 1875, Homer quit working as a commercial illustrator and vowed to survive on his paintings and watercolors alone. Despite his excellent critical reputation, his finances continued to remain precarious.Johns (2002), p. 84. His popular 1872 painting "Snap the Whip" was exhibited at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as was one of his finest and most famous paintings "Breezing Up" (1876). Of his work at this time, Henry James wrote: File:Winslow Homer - Breezing Up (A Fair Wind) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|"Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)"<br />(1873–76; <br />National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). <blockquote>We frankly confess that we detest his subjects ... he has chosen the least pictorial range of scenery and civilization; he has resolutely treated them as if they "were" pictorial ... and, to reward his audacity, he has incontestably succeeded.Quoted by Updike, John: "Epic Homer", "Still Looking: Essays on American Art", p. 58. Alfred A. Knopf, 2005.</blockquote> Many disagreed with James. "Breezing Up", Homer's iconic painting of a father and three boys out for a spirited sail, received wide praise. The "New York Tribune" wrote, "There is no picture in this exhibition, nor can we remember when there has been a picture in any exhibition, that can be named alongside this." Visits to Petersburg, Virginia, around 1876 resulted in paintings of rural African American life. The same straightforward sensibility which allowed Homer to distill art from these potentially sentimental subjects also yielded the most unaffected views of African American life at the time, as illustrated in "Dressing for the Carnival" (1877){{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/22.220|title=Winslow Homer: Dressing for the Carnival (22.220) – Heilbrunn Timeline of ...
