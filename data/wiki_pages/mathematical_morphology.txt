File:DilationErosion.png|thumb|right|A shape (in blue) and its morphological dilation (in green) and erosion (in yellow) by a diamond-shaped structuring element. "Mathematical morphology" ("MM") is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of Geometry|geometrical structures, based on set theory, lattice theory, topology, and random functions. MM is most commonly applied to digital images, but it can be employed as well on Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs, polygon mesh|surface meshes, Solid geometry|solids, and many other spatial structures. Topology|Topological and Geometry|geometrical continuum (theory)|continuous-space concepts such as size, shape, convex set|convexity, Connectedness|connectivity, and geodesic distance, were introduced by MM on both continuous and discrete spaces. MM is also the foundation of morphological image processing, which consists of a set of operators that transform images according to the above characterizations. The basic morphological operators are Erosion (morphology)|erosion, Dilation (morphology)|dilation, Opening (morphology)|opening and Closing (morphology)|closing. MM was originally developed for binary images, and was later extended to grayscale Function (mathematics)|functions and images. The subsequent generalization to complete lattices is widely accepted today as MM's theoretical foundation. == History == Mathematical Morphology was developed in 1964 by the collaborative work of Georges Matheron and Jean Serra, at the "École des Mines de Paris", France. Matheron supervised the PhD thesis of Serra, devoted to the quantification of mineral characteristics from thin Cross section (geometry)|cross sections, and this work resulted in a novel practical approach, as well as theoretical advancements in integral geometry and topology. In 1968, the "Centre de Morphologie Mathématique" was founded by the École des Mines de Paris in Fontainebleau, France, led by Matheron and Serra. During the rest of the 1960s and most of the 1970s, MM dealt essentially with binary images, treated as Set (mathematics)|sets, and generated a large number of binary operators and techniques: Hit-or-miss transform, Dilation (morphology)|dilation, Erosion (morphology)|erosion, opening (morphology)|opening, closing (morphology)|closing, Granulometry (morphology)|granulometry, Hit-or-miss transform#Thinning|thinning, Topological skeleton|skeletonization, ultimate erosion, conditional bisector, and others. A random approach was also developed, based on novel image models. Most of the work in that period was developed in Fontainebleau. From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, MM was generalized to grayscale functions and images as well. Besides extending the main concepts (such as dilation, erosion, etc.) to functions, this generalization yielded new operators, such as Morphological Gradient|morphological gradients, top-hat transform and the Watershed (algorithm)|Watershed (MM's main Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation approach). In the 1980s and 1990s, MM gained a wider recognition, as research centers in several countries began to adopt and investigate the method. MM started to be applied to a large number of imaging problems and applications, especially in the field of non-linear filtering of noisy images. In 1986, Serra further generalized MM, this time to a theoretical framework based on complete lattices. This generalization brought flexibility to the theory, enabling its application to a much larger number of structures, including color images, video, Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs, Mesh (mathematics)|meshes, etc. At the same time, Matheron and Serra also formulated a theory for morphological Filter (mathematics)|filtering, based on the new lattice framework. The 1990s and 2000s also saw further theoretical advancements, including the concepts of "connection (morphology)|connections" and "leveling (morphology)|levelings". In 1993, the first International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM) took place in Barcelona, Spain. Since then, ISMMs are organized every 2–3 years: Fontainebleau, France (1994); Atlanta, United States of America|USA (1996); Amsterdam, Netherlands (1998); Palo Alto, California|CA, United States of America|USA (2000); Sydney, Australia (2002); Paris, France (2005); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2007); Groningen (city)|Groningen, Netherlands (2009); Intra (Verbania), Italy (2011); Uppsala, Sweden (2013); Reykjavík, Iceland (2015); and Fontainebleau, France (2017).  * "Introduction" by Pierre Soille, in (#serra94|Serra "et al."

(Eds.) 2005) == Binary morphology == In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a subset of a Euclidean space <math>\mathbb{R}^d</math> or the integer grid <math>\mathbb{Z}^d</math>, for some dimension "d".  The basic idea in binary morphology is to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. This simple "probe" is called the structuring element, and is itself a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or grid). Here are some examples of widely used structuring elements (denoted by "B"): * Let <math>E = \mathbb{R}^2</math>; "B" is an open disk of radius "r", centered at the origin. * Let <math>E = \mathbb{Z}^2</math>; "B" is a 3 × 3 square, that is, "B" = {(−1, −1), (−1, 0), (−1, 1), (0, −1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, −1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}. * Let <math>E = \mathbb{Z}^2</math>; "B" is the "cross" given by "B" = {(−1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}.  The basic operations are shift-invariant (Translational invariance|translation invariant) operators strongly related to Minkowski addition. Let "E" be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and "A" a binary image in "E". = File:Erosion.png|thumb|right|The erosion of the dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square. The Erosion (morphology)|erosion of the binary image "A" by the structuring element "B" is defined by : <math>A \ominus B = \{z\in E | B_{z} \subseteq A\},</math> where "B"<sub>"z"</sub> is the translation of "B" by the vector "z", i.e., <math>B_z = \{b + z \mid b \in B\}</math>, <math>\forall z \in E</math>. When the structuring element "B" has a center (e.g., "B" is a disk or a square), and this center is located on the origin of "E", then the erosion of "A" by "B" can be understood as the Locus (mathematics)|locus of points reached by the center of "B" when "B" moves inside "A". For example, the erosion of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disc of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 6 centered at the origin. The erosion of "A" by "B" is also given by the expression <math>A \ominus B = \bigcap_{b \in B} A_{-b}</math>. Example application: Assume we have received a fax of  a dark photocopy. Everything looks like it was written with a pen that is bleeding. Erosion process will allow thicker lines to get skinny and detect the hole inside the letter "o". = File:Dilation.png|thumb|right|The dilation of the dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square with rounded corners. The Dilation (morphology)|dilation of "A" by the structuring element "B" is defined by : <math>A \oplus B = \bigcup_{b \in B} A_b.</math> The dilation is commutative, also given by <math>A \oplus B = B \oplus A = \bigcup_{a \in A} B_a</math>. If "B" has a center on the origin, as before, then the dilation of "A" by "B" can be understood as the locus of the points covered by "B" when the center of "B" moves inside "A". In the above example, the dilation of the square of side 10 by the disk of radius 2 is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2. The dilation can also be obtained by <math>A \oplus B = \{z \in E \mid (B^s)_z \cap A \neq \varnothing\}</math>, where "B"<sup>"s"</sup> denotes the rotational symmetry|symmetric of "B", that is, <math>B^s = \{x \in E \mid -x \in B\}</math>. Example application: dilation is the dual operation of the erosion. Figures that are very lightly drawn get thick when "dilated". Easiest way to describe it is to imagine the same fax/text is written with a thicker pen. = File:Opening.png|thumb|right|The opening of the dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square with round corners. The Opening (morphology)|opening of "A" by "B" is obtained by the erosion of "A" by "B", followed by dilation of the resulting image by "B": : <math>A \circ B  = (A \ominus B) \oplus B.</math> The opening is also given by <math>A \circ B = \bigcup_{B_x \subseteq A} B_x</math>, which means that it is the locus of translations of the structuring element "B" inside the image "A". In the case of the square of side 10, and a disc of radius 2 as the structuring element, the opening is a square of side 10 with rounded corners, where the corner radius is 2. Example application: Let's assume someone has written a note on a non-soaking paper and that the writing looks as if it is growing tiny hairy roots all over. Opening essentially removes the outer tiny "hairline" leaks and restores the text. The side effect is that it rounds off things. The sharp edges start to disappear. = File:Closing.png|thumb|right|The closing of the dark-blue shape (union of two squares) by a disk, resulting in the union of the dark-blue shape and the light-blue areas. The Closing (morphology)|closing of "A" by "B" is obtained by the dilation of "A" by "B", followed by erosion of the resulting structure by "B": : <math>A \bullet B = (A \oplus B) \ominus B.</math> The closing can also be obtained by <math>A \bullet B = (A^c \circ B^s)^c</math>, where "X"<sup>"c"</sup> denotes the complement (set theory)|complement of "X" relative to "E" (that is, <math>X^c = \{x \in E \mid x \notin X\}</math>). The above means that the closing is the complement of the locus of translations of the symmetric of the structuring element outside the image "A". = Here are some properties of the basic binary morphological operators (dilation, erosion, opening and closing): * They are Translational invariance|translation invariant. * They are increasing, that is, if <math>A\subseteq C</math>, then <math>A\oplus B \subseteq C\oplus B</math>, and <math>A\ominus B \subseteq C\ominus B</math>, etc. * The dilation is commutative: <math>A\oplus B = B\oplus A</math> . * If the origin of "E" belongs to the structuring element "B", then <math>A\ominus B\subseteq A\circ B\subseteq A\subseteq A\bullet B\subseteq A\oplus B</math>. * The dilation is associative, i.e., <math>(A\oplus B)\oplus C = A\oplus (B\oplus C)</math>. Moreover, the erosion satisfies <math>(A\ominus B)\ominus C = A\ominus (B\oplus C)</math>. * Erosion and dilation satisfy the duality <math>A \oplus B = (A^{c} \ominus B^{s})^{c}</math>. * Opening and closing satisfy the duality <math>A \bullet B = (A^{c} \circ B^{s})^{c}</math>. * The dilation is Distributive property|distributive over set union * The erosion is Distributive property|distributive over set intersection * The dilation is a pseudo-inverse of the erosion, and vice versa, in the following sense: <math>A\subseteq (C\ominus B)</math> if and only if <math>(A\oplus B)\subseteq C</math>. * Opening and closing are idempotent. * Opening is anti-extensive, i.e., <math>A\circ B\subseteq A</math>, whereas the closing is "extensive", i.e., <math>A\subseteq A\bullet B</math>.  * Hit-or-miss transform * Pruning (morphology)|Pruning transform * Morphological skeleton * Filtering by reconstruction * Ultimate erosions and conditional bisectors * Granulometry (morphology)|Granulometry * Geodesic distance functions ==Grayscale morphology== File:Watershed of gradient of MRI heart image.png|thumb|right|Watershed of the gradient of the cardiac image In grayscale morphology, images are Function (mathematics)|functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid "E" into <math>\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}</math>, where <math>\mathbb{R}</math> is the set of real numbers|reals, <math>\infty</math> is an element larger than any real number, and <math>-\infty</math> is an element smaller than any real number. Grayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called "structuring functions". Denoting an image by "f"("x") the structuring function by "b"("x") and the support of "g" by "B", the grayscale dilation of "f" by "b" is given by : <math>(f \oplus b)(x) = \sup_{y \in B},</math> where "sup" denotes the supremum. Similarly, the erosion of "f" by "b" is given by : <math>(f \ominus b)(x) = \inf_{y \in B},</math> where "inf" denotes the infimum. Just like in binary morphology, the opening and closing are given respectively by : <math>f \circ b = (f \ominus b) \oplus b,</math> : <math>f \bullet b = (f \oplus b) \ominus b.</math>  It is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions "b"("x") in the form : <math>b(x) = \begin{cases}  0, & x \in B, \\  -\infty & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}</math> where <math>B \subseteq E</math>. In this case, the dilation and erosion are greatly simplified, and given respectively by : <math>(f \oplus b)(x) = \sup_{z \in B^s} f(x + z),</math><!--See demonstration at Dilation_(morphology)#Flat_structuring_functions--> : <math>(f \ominus b)(x) = \inf_{z \in B} f(x + z).</math> In the bounded, discrete case ("E" is a grid and "B" is bounded), the supremum and infimum operators can be replaced by the maximum and minimum. Thus, dilation and erosion are particular cases of order statistics filters, with dilation returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support "B"), and the erosion returning the minimum value within the moving window "B". In the case of flat structuring element, the morphological operators depend only on the relative ordering of pixel values, regardless their numerical values, and therefore are especially suited to the processing of binary images and grayscale images whose light transfer function is not known.  * Morphological gradients * Top-hat transform * Watershed (algorithm)|Watershed algorithm By combining these operators one can obtain algorithms for many image processing tasks, such as feature extraction|feature detection, image segmentation, Unsharp masking|image sharpening, Filter (signal processing)|image filtering, and Statistical classification|classi ...
