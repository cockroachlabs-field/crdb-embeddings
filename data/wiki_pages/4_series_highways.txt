They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroutes of Quebec|Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, and are regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The 400-series designations were introduced in 1952, although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior. Initially, only Highways&nbsp;Ontario Highway 400|400, Ontario Highway 401|401 and Ontario Highway 402|402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades. Modern 400-series highways have high design standards, speed limits of , with a  limit on select stretches, and various collision avoidance and traffic management systems. The design of 400-series highways has set the precedent for a number of innovations used throughout North America, including the partial cloverleaf interchange|parclo interchange and a modified Jersey barrier design known as the Ontario Tall Wall. As a result, they currently experience one of the lowest accident and fatality rates comparative to traffic volume in North America.  == History == When the 400-series designations were first applied to Ontario freeways in 1952, several divided highways had already been opened in Southern Ontario. Originally inspired by German Reichsautobahn|Autobahns, Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten planned a network of "Dual Highways" across the southern half of the province during the 1930s. The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) was first, an upgrade to the partially constructed The Middle Road|Middle Road in 1934. McQuesten also sought out the economic opportunities that came with linking Toronto to Detroit and New York (state)|New York state by divided roadways with interchanges at major crossroads. Although he no longer served as Minister of Highways by the onset of World War II, his ambitious plans would come to fruition in the following decades as Highways 400, 401, 402, 403 (between Woodstock and Hamilton), and 405.|ps=.}} The construction boom following the war resulted in many new freeway construction projects in the province. The Toronto–Barrie Highway (Highway&nbsp;400), Trans-Provincial Highway (Highway&nbsp;401), a short expansion of Highway&nbsp;7 approaching the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia (Highway&nbsp;402), and an expansion of Highway&nbsp;27 (eventually designated as Highway 427 by the mid-1970s) into part of the Toronto Bypass were all underway or completed by the early 1950s. Seeking a way to distinguish the controlled-access freeways from the existing two-lane King's Highways, the Department of Highways created the 400-series designations in 1952. By the end of the year, Highway&nbsp;400, 401, and 402 were numbered, although they were only short stubs of their current lengths. Highway&nbsp;401 was assembled across the province in a patchwork fashion, becoming fully navigable between Windsor and the Quebec border on November&nbsp;10, 1964;. Highway&nbsp;400 was extended north to Coldwater, Ontario|Coldwater on Christmas Eve 1959; Highway&nbsp;402 was extended to London between 1972 and 1982. In addition to this network backbone, plans for additional 400-series highways were initiated by the late 1950s, comprising the Chedoke Expressway (Highway&nbsp;403) through Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton; the Don Valley Parkway Extension (Highway&nbsp;404) northward from the soon-to-be constructed Toronto expressway; Highway&nbsp;405 to connect with the American border near St. Catharines; Highway&nbsp;406 south from St. Catharines to Welland; Highway&nbsp;407 encircling the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), though not built for another 40 years; Highway&nbsp;409 to connect Highway&nbsp;401 with Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto International Airport; and The Queensway (Highway&nbsp;417) through Ottawa. The first sections of these freeways were opened in 1963, 1977, 1963, 1965, 1997, 1974, and 1960, respectively. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, additional freeways were planned or built, including Highway&nbsp;427 in Toronto, Highway&nbsp;403 through Mississauga, Highway&nbsp;410 north to Brampton and Highway&nbsp;416 to connect Highways&nbsp;401 and 417. Highway&nbsp;420 was designated in Niagara Falls, though it had been built as part of the QEW in 1941. Other major works included the skyway bridges along the QEW and the expansion of Highway&nbsp;401 through most of Toronto into twelve-lane collector–express systems. By the mid-1980s, the network had more-or-less taken its current shape, with only Highways&nbsp;407 and 416 yet to be built. Instead, emphasis was placed on expanding existing routes to accommodate increasing traffic volumes. However, extensions of Highway&nbsp;400 towards Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound,{{cite web  | title       = Highway 69 Four- ...
