  "Eparchy" ( "eparchía" "overlordship") is an Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical unit in Eastern Christianity that is equivalent to a diocese in Western Christianity. An eparchy is governed by an "eparch", who is a bishop. Depending on the administrative structure of a specific Eastern Church, an eparchy can belong to an ecclesiastical province (usually a Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis), but it can also be exempt. Each eparchy is divided into parishes, in the same manner as a diocese in Western Churches. Historical development of eparchies in various Eastern Churches was marked by local distinctions that can be observed in modern ecclesiastical practices of Eastern Orthodox Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches. ==Terminology== The English language|English word "eparchy" is an anglicized term that comes from the original Greek language|Greek word (|eparchía|overlordship}}, ). It is an Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun, formed with an intensive word form|intensive prefix (, ,  + , , ). It is commonly Latinization (literature)|Latinized as "eparchia". The term can be loosely translated as the rule over something (literally: an overlordship). The term had various meanings and multiple uses throughout history, mainly in politics and administration, starting from the Hellenistic period, and continuing throughout the Roman era.  In the Greco-Roman world, it was used as a Greek equivalent for the Latin language|Latin term "provincia", denoting Eparchy (Roman province)|province, the main administrative unit of the Roman Empire. The Eparchy (Byzantine province)|same use was employed in the early Byzantine Empire until major administrative reforms that were undertaken between the 7th and 9th centuries, abolishing the old provincial system. In modern times, the term was also employed within administrative systems of some countries, like Eparchy (modern Greece)|Greece and Eparchy (modern Cyprus)|Cyprus. Since it was commonly used as the main Greek designation for an administrative province of the Roman Empire, the term "eparchy" consequently gained an additional use among Greek-speaking Christians, denoting Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical structures on the provincial level of Church administration, within Eastern Christianity. Such terminological borrowing resulted from the final consolidation of the provincial (metropolitan) system in the 4th century. The First Ecumenical Council (325) confirmed (Canon IV) that all bishops of each civil province should be grouped in one ecclesiastical province, headed by a metropolitan bishop|metropolitan (bishop of the provincial capital). Since civil provinces were called eparchies in Greek, the same term was used to define ecclesiastical provinces. Such use became customary, and metropolitan provinces came to be known as "eparchies". ==Eastern Orthodox Churches== File:EparhiiRPC-english.svg|265px|thumb|right|Eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church File:Map of Eparchies of Serbian Orthodox Church-en.svg|265px|thumb|right|Eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church Throughout the late antiquity and the early medieval period, within Eastern Orthodox terminology, the term "eparchy" remained a common designation for a metropolitan province i.e. "metropolis" (, ).  During the later medieval period, terminology started to shift, particularly within the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople. The process of Job title inflation|title-inflation that was affecting Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy also gained momentum in ecclesiastical circles. In order to promote centralization, patriarchal authorities started to multiply the numbers of metropolitans by elevating local bishops to honorary metropolitan ranks without giving them any real metropolitan powers, and making them directly appointed and thus more dependent on Constantinople. As a consequence, the use of the word "eparchy" was expanded to include not only proper metropolitan provinces, but also the newly created honorary metropolitan sees that were no real provinces, and thus no different then simple bishoprics except in honorary titles and ranks. In spite of that, such honorary metropolitan sees also came to be called "eparchies". This process was systematically promoted, thus resulting in a major terminological shift.

Similar ecclesiastical terminology is also employed by other Autocephaly (Eastern Orthodoxy)|autocephalous and Autonomy (Eastern Orthodoxy)|autonomous Churches within Organization of the Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox community. In those who are non-Greek, term "eparchy" is used in local variants, and also has various equivalents in local languages. Eparchies of the main Eastern Orthodox Churches: * Eparchies of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople * Eparchies of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria * Eparchies of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antiochia * Eparchies of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem * Eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Romanian Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Georgian Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Cypriot Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Orthodox Church of Greece * Eparchies of the Polish Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Albanian Orthodox Church * Eparchies of the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church ==Eastern Catholic Churches== In the Eastern Catholic Churches, eparchy is equivalent to a diocese of the Latin Church, and its Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop can be called an eparch (equivalent to a diocesan of the Latin Church). At the same time, archeparchy is equivalent to an archdiocese of the Latin Church and its bishop can be called an archeparch (equivalent to an archbishop of the Roman Rite). Individual eparchies of some Eastern Catholic Churches may be suffragan to Latin Church metropolitans. For example, the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci is suffragan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb. Also, some minor Eastern Catholic churches have Latin prelates. For example, the Macedonian Greek Catholic Church is organized as a single Macedonian Catholic Eparchy of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Strumica-Skopje|Eparchy of Strumica-Skopje, whose present ordinary is the Roman Catholic bishop of Skopje. ==See also== * Eparchy (Roman province) * Eparchy (Byzantine province) * Eparchy (modern Greece) * Eparchy (modern Cyprus) ==References==  ==Sources==  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   ==External links==  *  *  *   Category:Eastern Christianity Category:Dioceses (ecclesiastical) Category:Bishops by type Category:Episcopacy in the Catholic Church Category:Episcopacy in Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Episcopacy in Oriental Orthodoxy Category:Ecclesiastical titles Category:Greek words and phrases
