There is often accompanying eye watering, nasal congestion, or swelling around the eye on the affected side. These symptoms typically last 15 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks often occur in clusters which typically last for weeks or months and occasionally more than a year. <!-- Cause and diagnosis --> The cause is unknown. Risk factors include a history of exposure to tobacco smoke and a Family history (medicine)|family history of the condition. Exposures which may trigger attacks include ethanol|alcohol, nitroglycerin (medication)|nitroglycerin, and histamine. They are a primary headache disorder of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias type. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. <!--Treatment and prevention --> Recommended management includes Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle adaptations such as avoiding potential triggers. Treatments for acute attacks include Oxygen therapy|oxygen or a fast-acting triptan. Measures recommended to decrease the frequency of attacks include steroid injections, Zucapsaicin|civamide, or verapamil. Nerve stimulation or surgery may occasionally be used if other measures are not effective. <!-- Epidemiology, history, and culture --> The condition affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point in their life and 0.05% in any given year. The condition usually first occurs between 20 and 40 years of age. Men are affected about four times more often than women. Cluster headaches are named for the occurrence of groups of headache attacks (clusters). They have also been referred to as "suicide headaches". ==Signs and symptoms== Cluster headaches are recurring bouts of severe unilateral headache attacks. The duration of a typical CH attack ranges from about 15 to 180 minutes. About 75% of untreated attacks last less than 60 minutes. However, females may have longer and more severe CH. The onset of an attack is rapid and typically without an Aura (symptom)|aura. Preliminary sensations of pain in the general area of attack, referred to as "shadows", may signal an imminent CH, or these symptoms may linger after an attack has passed, or between attacks. Though CH is strictly unilateral, there are some documented cases of "side-shift" between cluster periods, or, rarely, simultaneous (within the same cluster period) bilateral cluster headaches.  The pain occurs only on one side of the head, around the eye, particularly behind or above the eye, in the temple. The pain is typically greater than in other headache conditions, including migraines, and is usually described as burning, stabbing, drilling or squeezing. While suicide is rare, those with cluster headaches may experience suicidal thoughts (giving the alternative name "suicide headache" or "suicidal headache").  The term "headache" does not adequately convey the severity of the condition; the disease may be the most painful condition known to medical science. Peter Goadsby|Dr. Peter Goadsby, Professor of Clinical Neurology at University College London, a leading researcher on the condition has commented: }}  The typical symptoms of cluster headache include grouped occurrence and recurrence (cluster) of headache attack, severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency may range from one attack every two days to eight attacks per day. Cluster headache attack is accompanied by at least one of the following autonomic symptoms: Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid, miosis|pupil constriction, redness of the conjunctiva, lacrimation|tearing, rhinorrhea|runny nose and less commonly, facial blushing, swelling, or sweating, typically appearing on the same side of the head as the pain. Similar to a migraine, sensitivity to light (photophobia) or noise (phonophobia) may occur during a CH. Nausea is a rare symptom although it has been reported. Restlessness (for example, pacing or rocking back and forth) may occur. Secondary effects may include the inability to organize thoughts and plans, physical exhaustion, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness, depression, and anxiety. People with CH may dread facing another headache and adjust their physical or social activities around a possible future occurrence. Likewise they may seek assistance to accomplish what would otherwise be normal tasks. They may hesitate to make plans because of the regularity, or conversely, the unpredictability of the pain schedule. These factors can lead to generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorder, serious depressive disorders, social withdrawal and isolation. Cluster headaches have been recently associated with obstructive sleep apnea comorbidity.  Cluster headaches may occasionally be referred to as "alarm clock headache" because of the regularity of their recurrence. CH attacks often awaken individuals from sleep.  Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks typically striking at a precise time of day each morning or night. The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body's "biological clock" and circadian rhythm.{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0317167100001694 |pmid=11858532 |title=Cluster Headache: Evidence for a Disorder of Circadian Rhythm and Hypothalamic Function |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=33â€“40 |year=2014 |last1=Pringsheim |firs ...
