British Museum. "Lucius Clodius Macer" was a "legatus" of the Roman Empire in Africa (province)|Africa in the time of Nero.  He revolted in May 68, cutting off the food supply of Rome, possibly at the instigation of Calvia Crispinilla.  Although encouraged by Galba, Macer raised a legion Legio I Macriana liberatrix|Legio I "Macriana liberatrix" in addition to the Legio III Augusta|Legio III "Augusta" that he already commanded, presumably raising suspicion that Macer also harbored imperial ambitions, and in October 68 Galba had him killed by the procurator (Roman)|procurator Trebonius Garutianus. Papirus, the centurion of Mucianus, was implicated in his assassination. He produced denarius|denarii which are extremely rare today. Only about 85 are known to exist, of which only 20 bear his portrait. He uses the formulaic abbreviation S C (senatus consulto) on his denarii; this otherwise had only rarely appeared on Roman silver coins since about 40 BC. We may take this and his decision to portray himself without a laurel wreath or a diadem as evidence that he wished to portray his revolt as being against Nero, not the senate. ==Sources== * Plutarch, "Galba"  * Tacitus, "Histories (Tacitus)|Histories" 1,37,3; 1,7,1; 2,97,2; 4,49,4. == External links ==    Category:68 deaths|Clodius Lucius Macer Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:1st-century Romans Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Clodii|Macer, Lucius Category:Roman rebels Category:Assassinated Roman politicians
