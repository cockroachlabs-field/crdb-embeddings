This was the last studio album Pantera released before their nineteen-year breakup from November 2003 to July 2022, and it is the band's final album to feature the Abbott brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul, before their deaths in 2004 and 2018, respectively. ==Background== "Reinventing the Steel" was produced by the Abbott brothers in addition to Sterling Winfield, making it Pantera's first studio album since 1988's "Power Metal (album)|Power Metal" not to be produced by Terry Date. In Australia, a two-disc "Tour Edition" of the album was released. The first disc consists of the album proper while the second is an unofficial hits compilation. The album was reissued in October 2020 with extra discs including a new mix by Date and unreleased tracks to honor the album's 20th anniversary. Unlike other Pantera releases, two A-side and B-side|B-sides were recorded during the "Reinventing the Steel" sessions, those being "Avoid the Light" and "Immortally Insane", found on the "Dracula 2000" and "Heavy Metal 2000", and the "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|Texas Chainsaw Massacre" soundtracks, respectively. ==Lyrics and style== "Reinventing the Steel" contains lyrics mostly about the band itself, as on "We'll Grind that Axe for a Long Time" (where the band members tell about how they have kept it "true" throughout the years, while many of their peers "sucked up for the fame") and "I'll Cast a Shadow" (about Pantera's influence on the genre). There are also songs about their fans, like "Goddamn Electric" and "You've Got to Belong to It". "Goddamn Electric" mentions Black Sabbath and Slayer, two of Pantera's main influences. The solo for "Goddamn Electric" was recorded by Kerry King in a bathroom after Slayer performed at Ozzfest in Dallas. The band members dedicated "Reinventing the Steel" to their fans who they viewed as their "brothers and sisters". ==Artwork== The cover art is by Scott Caliva (1967–2003), a friend of Pantera lead singer Phil Anselmo. Caliva took the photo of a partygoer at Anselmo's house jumping through a bonfire clutching a bottle of Wild Turkey (bourbon)|Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey. The bottle is Pixelization|pixelated on the cover so the label would not be visible, to avoid copyright infringement.

"CMJ" (4/3/00, p.&nbsp;32) – "Crammed with everything they've used to revolutionize metal....so old-school it could have been easily made in between the quartet's back-to-back classics." "NME" (4/15/00, p.&nbsp;34) – 6 out of 10 – "An unfashionably old-school metal album....it's Pantera's bid to herald the rebirth of bullet-belt, cut-off denim metal....It's a solid album, oozing drunk-as-hell metal spirit."
