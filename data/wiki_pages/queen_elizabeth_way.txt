The Controlled-access highway|freeway begins at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie and travels  around the western end of Lake Ontario, ending at Ontario Highway 427|Highway&nbsp;427 in Toronto. The physical highway, however, continues as the Gardiner Expressway into downtown Toronto. The QEW is one of Ontario's busiest highways, with an average of close to 200,000 vehicles per day on some sections. Major highway junctions are at Ontario Highway 420|Highway&nbsp;420 in Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls, Ontario Highway 405|Highway&nbsp;405 in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario Highway 406|Highway&nbsp;406 in St. Catharines, the Red Hill Valley Parkway in Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton, Ontario Highway 403|Highway&nbsp;403 and Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407 in Burlington, Ontario|Burlington, Highway403 at the Oakville, Ontario|Oakville–Mississauga boundary, and Highway427 in Etobicoke. Within the Regional Municipality of Halton the QEW is signed Concurrency (road)|concurrently with Highway403. The Speed limits in Canada|speed limit is  throughout most of its length, with the exceptions being between Hamilton and St. Catharines where the posted limit is . The history of the QEW dates back to 1931, when work began to widen the Middle Road in a similar fashion to the nearby Ontario Highway 5|Dundas Highway and Lakeshore Road as a relief project during the Great Depression. Following the 1934 Ontario general election|1934 provincial election, Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten and his deputy minister Robert Melville Smith changed the design to be similar to the autobahns of Germany, dividing the opposite directions of travel and using Grade separation|grade-separated interchanges at major crossroads. When opened to traffic in 1937, it was the first intercity divided highway in North America and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world. While not a true freeway at the time, it was gradually upgraded, widened, and modernized beginning in the 1950s, more or less taking on its current form by 1975. Since then, various projects have continued to widen the route. In 1997, the provincial government turned over the responsibility for the section of the QEW between Highway427 and the Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River to the City of Toronto. This section was subsequently redesignated as part of the Gardiner Expressway.  == Name and signage == File:Original QEW shield.jpg|thumb|left|Original Queen Elizabeth Way signage, 1940 The Queen Elizabeth Way was named for the wife and royal consort of George VI|King George VI who would later become known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. It is sometimes referred to as the Queen E. In 1939, the royal couple 1939 royal tour of Canada|toured Canada and the United States in part to bolster support for the United Kingdom in anticipation of war with Nazi Germany, and also to mark George VI's coronation. The highway received its name to commemorate the visit; it was unveiled on June&nbsp;7 as the King and Queen ceremonially opened the highway at a site near the Henley Bridge (Ontario)|Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. Originally, the highway featured stylized light standards with the letters ""ER"", the Royal Cypher for "Elizabeth Regina", the Latin equivalent to "Queen Elizabeth." While mostly removed, they remain on three bridges along the highway: in Mississauga over the Credit River, in Oakville over Bronte Creek, and in St. Catharines over Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek. A short section of Highway&nbsp;420 in Niagara Falls and its extension, Falls Avenue, had replicas of these light standards installed in 2002. The reassurance marker|markers identifying the QEW have always used blue lettering on a yellow background instead of the black-on-white scheme other provincial highway markers use. They originally showed the highway's full name only in small letters, with the large script letters "ER" placed where the highway number is on other signs. In 1955, these were changed to the current design, with the lettering "QEW." Although the QEW has no posted highway number, it is considered to be part of the Province of Ontario's 400-series highway network. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario designates the QEW as "Highway 451" for internal, administrative purposes. A Queen Elizabeth Way Monument|monument was originally in the Median strip|highway median at the Toronto terminus of the highway, dedicated to the 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the "Lucky Lion." The column, with a crown at the top and a lion at the base, was designed by William Lyon Somerville|W. L. Somerville and sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle for $12,000 (equivalent to $}} in ). The monument was removed in 1972 in order to accommodate widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir Casimir Gzowski Park along Lake Ontario, on the east side of the Humber River. == Route description ==  The QEW is a  route that travels from the Peace Bridge&nbsp;– which connects Fort Erie with Buffalo, New York&nbsp;– to Toronto, the economic hub of the province. The freeway circles the western lakehead of Lake Ontario, cutting through Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville, and Mississauga en route. A  portion of the freeway in Burlington is signed concurrently with Ontario Highway 403|Highway&nbsp;403. Unlike other provincial highways in Ontario, the QEW is directionally signed using locations along the route as opposed to cardinal directions. Driving towards Toronto, the route is signed as "QEW Toronto" throughout its length. In the opposing direction, it is signed as "QEW Hamilton," "QEW Niagara," and "QEW Fort Erie" depending on the location.  The Queen Elizabeth Way begins at the foot of the Peace Bridge, which crosses the United States border and connects with Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190 in Buffalo, New York. A customs booth is between the bridge and the freeway, beyond which a toll is charged to Canada-bound drivers. West of there, access is provided to nearby Ontario Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3 and the Niagara Parkway. Through customs, the four-lane freeway proper begins, immediately curving northwest. Within Fort Erie, interchanges provide access to and from the QEW at Central Avenue, Concession Road, Thompson Road, Gilmore Road, and Bowen Road. While there is some urban development at the beginning of the freeway, the majority of the first  are within lowland forests. Numerous creeks flow through these forests, often flooding them. The Willoughby Marsh Conservation Area lies southwest of the freeway, approximately  south of Niagara Falls. After an interchange with Lyons Creek Road, the freeway turns northward. After crossing the Welland River (Ontario)|Welland River, the original route of the First Welland Canal|Welland Canal, the freeway exits the forests and enters agricultural land surrounding the suburbs of Niagara Falls, which the highway enters north of the McLeod Road interchange. Within the city, Ontario Highway 420|Highway&nbsp;420 meets the QEW at a large four-level junction, and widens to six lanes. The opposing carriageways split at this interchange to accommodate the left-hand exit/entry of the flyover ramps accessing Highway&nbsp;420, with the Toronto-bound traffic passing under these flyovers and a CN rail crossing. Exiting the northern fringe of Niagara Falls, the freeway again curves northwest and begins to descend through the Niagara Escarpment, a World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve. Ontario Highway 405|Highway&nbsp;405 merges with the QEW along the short rural stretch between Niagara Falls and St. Catharines. While there is no Toronto-bound access to Highway&nbsp;405, Niagara-bound drivers can follow this short freeway to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge, which crosses the U.S. border into Lewiston, New York. The QEW continues west into St. Catharines.  File:QEW at Red Hill Valley.jpg|left|thumb|The Niagara-bound QEW at the Red Hill Valley Parkway interchange in Hamilton As the Queen Elizabeth Way enters St. Catharines, it ascends the Garden City Skyway to cross the Welland Canal. This  structure replaced the lift bridge south of it, one of two major bottlenecks prior to the early 1960s, and is one of two high-level skyways along the route. As the QEW was the first long distance freeway in North America, several modern engineering concepts were not considered in its original 1939 design, and although it was modernized in a recent reconstruction that concluded in 2011, further expansion of the highway is inhibited by the proximity of properties throughout most of its length. Consequently, most of the route beyond the Welland Canal is wedged between service roads which provide access to and from the QEW as well as to local businesses and residences. After passing the Ontario Street (Regional Road&nbsp;42) interchange, the freeway crosses Martindale Pond, which forms the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek. West of the crossing is an interchange with Highway&nbsp;406, which travels south to Welland, after which the QEW crosses out of St. Catharines and into the town of Lincoln, Ontario|Lincoln at Fifteen Mile Creek continuing with a six-lane cross section. Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels along the Lake Ontario shoreline through the Niagara Fruit Belt; numerous wineries line the south side of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road&nbsp;24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road&nbsp;18) provide access to the communities of Vineland, Ontario|Vineland and Beamsville, Ontario|Beamsville, respectively. The latter encroaches upon the south side of the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters Grimsby, Ontario|Grimsby, where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three overpasses that have remained unchanged since the highway was built: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street, and Christie Street, all served by a single diamond interchange. South of the 50&nbsp;Point Conservation Area, the freeway exits the Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region and enters the city of Hamilton. Within Hamilton, the highway passes almost entirely within an industrial park, with interchanges at 50&nbsp;Road, Fruitland Road, and Centennial Parkway (formerly Ontario Highway 20|Highway&nbsp;20).
