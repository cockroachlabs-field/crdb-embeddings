The songs are generally sung by female and male performers with accompanying bands or choirs accompanied by a large orchestra (either Western style or a hybrid of western and traditional) or concert band, and in recent years, a pop band with guitars, keyboards, and brass section with occasional accordions and traditional instrumentation.
