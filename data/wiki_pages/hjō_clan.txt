Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual political power in Japan during this period compared to both the Kamakura Shogun|shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hōjō are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hōjō rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate. ==Bloodline== The Hōjō are alleged to have been an offshoot of the Taira of the Emperor Kanmu|Kanmu branch, originating in Izu Province.  They gained power by supporting the defeat of the Taira by intermarrying with and supporting Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Battle of Dan-no-ura. The Hōjō usurped power when Yoritomo died eighteen years later. ==Rise to power==  Hōjō Tokimasa helped Minamoto no Yoritomo, a son-in-law, defeat the forces of the Taira clan|Taira to become Japan's first "shōgun".  Hōjō Masako, Tokimasa's daughter, was married to Yoritomo.  After the death of Yoritomo, Tokimasa became "shikken" (regent) to the child "shōgun", thus effectively transferring control of the shogunate to his clan permanently. The Minamoto and the Imperial Princes became puppets and hostages of the Hōjō. ==Early events== The Imperial Court in Kyoto|Imperial court at Kyoto resented the decline in its authority during the Kamakura shogunate, and in 1221 the Jōkyū War broke out between retired Emperor Go-Toba and the second regent Hōjō Yoshitoki. The Hōjō forces easily won the war, and the imperial court was brought under the direct control of the shogunate. The Shugo|"shōgun"s constables gained greater civil powers, and the court was obliged to seek the "shōgun"s approval for all of its actions. Although deprived of political power, the court retained extensive estates in Kyoto. Several significant administrative achievements were made during the Hōjō regency. In 1225 the third regent Hōjō Yasutoki established the Hyōjōsho|Council of State, providing opportunities for other military lords to exercise judicial and legislative authority at Kamakura. The Hōjō regent presided over the council, which was a successful form of collective leadership. The adoption of Japan's first military code of law—the Goseibai Shikimoku—in 1232 reflected the profound transition from court to militarized society. While legal practices in Kyoto were still based on 500-year-old Confucianism|Confucian principles, the new code was a highly legalistic document that stressed the duties of stewards and constables, provided means for settling land disputes, and established rules governing inheritances. It was clear and concise, stipulated punishments for violators of its conditions, and remained in effect for the next 635 years. As might be expected, the literature of the time reflected the unsettled nature of the period. The "Hōjōki" describes the turmoil of the period in terms of the Buddhism|Buddhist concepts of impermanence and the vanity of human projects. The "Heike monogatari" narrated the rise and fall of the Taira, replete with tales of wars and samurai deeds. A second literary mainstream was the continuation of anthologies of poetry in the "Shin Kokin Wakashū", of which twenty volumes were produced between 1201 and 1205. ==List of Hōjō "Shikken"== # Hōjō Tokimasa (1138–1215) (r. 1203–1205) # Hōjō Yoshitoki (1163–1224) (r. 1205–1224) # Hōjō Yasutoki (1183–1242) (r. 1224–1242) # Hōjō Tsunetoki (1224–1246) (r. 1242–1246) # Hōjō Tokiyori (1227–1263) (r. 1246–1256) # Hōjō Nagatoki (1229–1264) (r. 1256–1264) # Hōjō Masamura (1205–1273) (r. 1264–1268) # Hōjō Tokimune (1251–1284) (r. 1268–1284) # Hōjō Sadatoki (1271–1311) (r. 1284–1301) # Hōjō Morotoki (1275–1311) (r. 1301–1311) # Hōjō Munenobu (1259–1312) (r. 1311–1312) # Hōjō Hirotoki (1279–1315) (r. 1312–1315) # Hōjō Mototoki (1286-1333) (r. 1315) # Hōjō Takatoki (1303–1333) (r. 1316–1326) # Hōjō Sadaaki (1278–1333) (r. 1326) # Hōjō Moritoki (1295-1333) (r. 1327–1333) # Hōjō Sadayuki (1302-1333) (r.1333) Aside from the regents above, those who played an important role among the Hōjō clan are: *Hōjō Sanetoki *Hōjō Masako ==References in media== * The Taiheiki (Japanese: 太平記) is a Japanese historical epic written in the late 14th century that details the fall of the Hōjō clan and rise of the Ashikaga clan|Ashikaga, and the period of war (Nanboku-chō) between the Northern Court of Ashikaga Takauji in Kyoto, and the Southern Court of Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino, which forever splintered the Japanese Imperial Family.
