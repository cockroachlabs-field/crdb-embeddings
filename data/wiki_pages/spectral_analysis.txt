"Spectral analysis" or "spectrum analysis" is analysis in terms of a spectrum of frequencies or related quantities such as energies, eigenvalues, etc.  In specific areas it may refer to:  * Spectroscopy in chemistry and physics, a method of analyzing the properties of matter from their electromagnetic interactions * Spectral estimation, in statistics and signal processing, an algorithm that estimates the strength of different frequency components (the power spectrum) of a time-domain signal.  This may also be called frequency domain analysis * Spectrum analyzer, a hardware device that measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument * Spectral theory, in mathematics, a theory that extends eigenvalues and eigenvectors to linear operators on Hilbert space, and more generally to the elements of a Banach algebra * In nuclear and particle physics, gamma spectroscopy, and high-energy astronomy, the analysis of the output of a pulse height analyzer for characteristic features such as spectral line, edges, and various physical processes producing continuum shapes ==See also== *Multispectral analysis *Harmonic analysis
