This Madrid neighborhood is known as the hippest part of town because of its history. Its main street, Fuencarral, runs parallel to calle Hortaleza, making Malasaña and Chueca very friendly neighborhoods. Its main plaza, Plaza de Dos de Mayo, was home to the battle in 1802 against Napoleon. Now the plaza is full of cafés and restaurant terraces. Malasaña was also home to Madrid’s breaking experimental movement known as La Movida Madrileña which sparked after the fall of Franco’s dictatorship in the late 1970’s. You can see remnants of graffiti as you walk through its tiny streets. High-end tattoo parlors, vintage shops, and uber-trendy cafés, bars and restaurants now replace the seedier places. You could call it the East Village of Madrid.
