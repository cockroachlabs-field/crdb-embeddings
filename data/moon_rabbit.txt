I’d follow chef Kevin Tien anywhere — and I have, from Himitsu, to Emilie’s, to Moon Rabbit #1, and now to the recently-opened Moon Rabbit #2. And that’s just in the past five years. The latest incarnation of Moon Rabbit occupies a lovely Penn Quarter space that once housed CoCo Sala, DC’s first — and hopefully only — chocolate-themed restaurant. Tien’s cooking at MR2 is grounded in his Vietnamese heritage punctuated with riffs from his Louisiana childhood and other influences. As always, Tien’s food is complex and creative — there’s always a lot going on — but unfailingly delicious. If I had to pick one DC chef to make my last meal, I’m going with Tien. But before I get overly fan-boy — too late, I know — don’t miss Beard-nominated pastry chef Susan Bae’s offerings. They’re the perfect complement to Tien’s savory dishes and reflect the same creative-without-sacrificing-deliciousness sensibility.
