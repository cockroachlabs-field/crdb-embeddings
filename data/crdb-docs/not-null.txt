                              Not Null Constraint

   The NOT NULL constraint specifies a column may not contain NULL values.

Details

     * INSERT or UPDATE statements containing NULL values are rejected. This
       includes INSERT statements that do not include values for any columns
       that do not have a DEFAULT value constraint.

   For example, if the table foo has columns a and b (and b does not have a
   DEFAULT VALUE), when you run the following command:

   > INSERT INTO foo (a) VALUES (1);

   CockroachDB tries to write a NULL value into column b. If that column has
   the NOT NULL constraint, the INSERT statement is rejected.

     * To add the NOT NULL constraint to an existing table column, use the
       ALTER COLUMN statement.

     * For more information about NULL, see Null Handling.

Syntax

   You can only apply the NOT NULL constraint to individual columns.

   CREATE TABLE table_name ( column_name column_type NOT NULL
   column_constraints , column_def table_constraints ) )

   Parameter          Description                                             
   table_name         The name of the table you're creating.                  
   column_name        The name of the constrained column.                     
   column_type        The constrained column's data type.                     
   column_constraints Any other column-level constraints you want to apply to 
                      this column.                                            
   column_def         Definitions for any other columns in the table.         
   table_constraints  Any table-level constraints you want to apply.          

Usage example

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
     customer_id INT         PRIMARY KEY,
     cust_name   STRING(30)  NULL,
     cust_email  STRING(100) NOT NULL
   );

   copy

 > INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, cust_name, cust_email) VALUES (1, 'Smith', NULL);

 pq: null value in column "cust_email" violates not-null constraint

   copy

 > INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, cust_name) VALUES (1, 'Smith');

 pq: null value in column "cust_email" violates not-null constraint
