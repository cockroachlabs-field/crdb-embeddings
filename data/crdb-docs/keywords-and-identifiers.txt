                             Keywords & Identifiers

   SQL statements consist of two fundamental components:

     * Keywords: Words with specific meaning in SQL like CREATE, INDEX, and
       BOOL
     * Identifiers: Names for things like databases and some functions

Keywords

   Keywords make up SQL's vocabulary and can have specific meaning in
   statements. Each SQL keyword that CockroachDB supports is on one of four
   lists:

     * Reserved Keywords
     * Type Function Name Keywords
     * Column Name Keywords
     * Unreserved Keywords

   Reserved keywords have fixed meanings and are not typically allowed as
   identifiers. All other types of keywords are considered non-reserved; they
   have special meanings in certain contexts and can be used as identifiers
   in other contexts.

  Keyword uses

   Most users asking about keywords want to know more about them in terms of:

     * Names of objects, covered on this page in Identifiers
     * Syntax, covered in our pages SQL Statements and SQL Grammar

Identifiers

   Identifiers are most commonly used as names of objects like databases,
   tables, or columns—because of this, the terms "name" and "identifier" are
   often used interchangeably. However, identifiers also have less-common
   uses, such as changing column labels with SELECT.

  Rules for Identifiers

   In our SQL grammar, all values that accept an identifier must:

     * Begin with a Unicode letter or an underscore (_). Subsequent
       characters can be letters, underscores, digits (0-9), or dollar signs
       ($).
     * Not equal any SQL keyword unless the keyword is accepted by the
       element's syntax. For example, name accepts Unreserved or Column Name
       keywords.

   To bypass either of these rules, simply surround the identifier with
   double-quotes ("). You can also use double-quotes to preserve
   case-sensitivity in database, table, view, and column names. However, all
   references to such identifiers must also include double-quotes.

   Note:
   Some statements have additional requirements for identifiers. For example,
   each table in a database must have a unique name. These requirements are
   documented on each statement's page.
