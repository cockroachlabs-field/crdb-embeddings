   The SET CLUSTER SETTING statement modifies a cluster-wide setting.

   Warning:
   Many cluster settings are intended for tuning CockroachDB internals.
   Before changing these settings, we strongly encourage you to discuss your
   goals with CockroachDB; otherwise, you use them at your own risk.

Required privileges

   Only members of the admin role can modify cluster settings. By default,
   the root user belongs to the admin role.

Synopsis

   SET CLUSTER SETTING var_name = TO var_value DEFAULT
   Note:
   The SET CLUSTER SETTING statement is unrelated to the other SET
   TRANSACTION and SET (session variable) statements.

Parameters

   Parameter Description                                                 
   var_name  The name of the cluster setting (case-insensitive).         
   var_value The value for the cluster setting.                          
             Reset the cluster setting to its default value.             
   DEFAULT                                                               
             The RESET CLUSTER SETTING resets a cluster setting as well. 

Examples

  Change the default distributed execution parameter

   To configure a cluster so that new sessions automatically try to run
   queries in a distributed fashion:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.defaults.distsql = 1;

   To disable distributed execution for all new sessions:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.defaults.distsql = 0;

  Disable automatic diagnostic reporting

   To opt out of automatic diagnostic reporting of usage data to Cockroach
   Labs:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING diagnostics.reporting.enabled = false;

   copy

 > SHOW CLUSTER SETTING diagnostics.reporting.enabled;

 +-------------------------------+
 | diagnostics.reporting.enabled |
 +-------------------------------+
 | false                         |
 +-------------------------------+
 (1 row)

  Reset a setting to its default value

   Tip:
   You can use RESET CLUSTER SETTING to reset a cluster setting as well.
   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled = false;

   copy

 > SHOW CLUSTER SETTING sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled;

 +---------------------------------------+
 | sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled |
 +---------------------------------------+
 | false                                 |
 +---------------------------------------+
 (1 row)

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled = DEFAULT;

   copy

 > SHOW CLUSTER SETTING sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled;

 +---------------------------------------+
 | sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled |
 +---------------------------------------+
 | true                                  |
 +---------------------------------------+
 (1 row)
