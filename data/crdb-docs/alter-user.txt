                                   ALTER USER

   The ALTER USER statement can be used to add, change, or remove a user's
   password and to change the login privileges for a user.

   Note:

   Since the keywords ROLE and USER can now be used interchangeably in SQL
   statements for enhanced Postgres compatibility, ALTER USER is now an alias
   for ALTER ROLE.

Considerations

     * Password creation and alteration is supported only in secure clusters.

Required privileges

   To alter other users, the user must have the CREATEROLE parameter set.

Synopsis

   ALTER USER IF EXISTS name WITH PASSWORD password

Parameters

   Parameter               Description                                        
   name                    The name of the user whose password you want to    
                           create or add.                                     
                           Let the user authenticate their access to a secure 
                           cluster using this new password. Passwords should  
                           be entered as a string literal. For compatibility  
                           with PostgreSQL, a password can also be entered as 
   password                an identifier.                                     
                                                                              
                           To prevent a user from using password              
                           authentication and to mandate certificate-based    
                           client authentication, set the password as NULL.   
   VALID UNTIL             The date and time (in the timestamp format) after  
                           which the password is not valid.                   
                           The LOGIN parameter allows a user to login with    
   LOGIN/NOLOGIN           one of the client authentication methods. Setting  
                           the parameter to NOLOGIN prevents the user from    
                           logging in using any authentication method.        
                           Allow or disallow the user to create, alter, and   
                           drop other users.                                  
   CREATEROLE/NOCREATEROLE                                                    
                           By default, the parameter is set to NOCREATEROLE   
                           for all non-admin and non-root users.              

Examples

  Change password using a string literal

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl WITH PASSWORD 'ilov3beefjerky';

 ALTER USER 1

  Change password using an identifier

   The following statement changes the password to ilov3beefjerky, as above:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl WITH PASSWORD ilov3beefjerky;

   This is equivalent to the example in the previous section because the
   password contains only lowercase characters.

   In contrast, the following statement changes the password to
   thereisnotomorrow, even though the password in the syntax contains
   capitals, because identifiers are normalized automatically:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl WITH PASSWORD ThereIsNoTomorrow;

   To preserve case in a password specified using identifier syntax, use
   double quotes:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl WITH PASSWORD "ThereIsNoTomorrow";

  Set password validity

   The following statement sets the date and time after which the password is
   not valid:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl VALID UNTIL '2021-01-01';

  Prevent a user from using password authentication

   The following statement prevents the user from using password
   authentication and mandates certificate-based client authentication:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl WITH PASSWORD NULL;

  Change login privileges for a user

   The following statement prevents the user from logging in with any client
   authentication method:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl NOLOGIN;

   copy

 > SHOW USERS;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | NOLOGIN    | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)

   The following statement allows the user to log in with one of the client
   authentication methods:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl LOGIN;

   copy

 > SHOW USERS;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)
