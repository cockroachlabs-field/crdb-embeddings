   The COLLATE feature lets you sort STRING values according to language- and
   country-specific rules, known as collations.

   Collated strings are important because different languages have different
   rules for alphabetic order, especially with respect to accented letters.
   For example, in German accented letters are sorted with their unaccented
   counterparts, while in Swedish they are placed at the end of the alphabet.
   A collation is a set of rules used for ordering and usually corresponds to
   a language, though some languages have multiple collations with different
   rules for sorting; for example Portuguese has separate collations for
   Brazilian and European dialects (pt-BR and pt-PT respectively).

   Note:

   Vectorized execution is currently not supported for this data type.

Details

     * Operations on collated strings cannot involve strings with a different
       collation or strings with no collation. However, it is possible to add
       or overwrite a collation on the fly.

     * Only use the collation feature when you need to sort strings by a
       specific collation. We recommend this because every time a collated
       string is constructed or loaded into memory, CockroachDB computes its
       collation key, whose size is linear in relationship to the length of
       the collated string, which requires additional resources.

     * Collated strings can be considerably larger than the corresponding
       uncollated strings, depending on the language and the string content.
       For example, strings containing the character é produce larger
       collation keys in the French locale than in Chinese.

     * Collated strings that are indexed require additional disk space as
       compared to uncollated strings. In case of indexed collated strings,
       collation keys must be stored in addition to the strings from which
       they are derived, creating a constant factor overhead.

Supported collations

   CockroachDB supports the collations provided by Go's language package. The
   <collation> argument is the BCP 47 language tag at the end of each line,
   immediately preceded by //. For example, Afrikaans is supported as the af
   collation.

SQL syntax

   Collated strings are used as normal strings in SQL, but have a COLLATE
   clause appended to them.

     * Column syntax: STRING COLLATE <collation>. For example:

       copy

 > CREATE TABLE foo (a STRING COLLATE en PRIMARY KEY);

       Note:
       You can also use any of the aliases for STRING.
     * Value syntax: <STRING value> COLLATE <collation>. For example:

       copy

 > INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('dog' COLLATE en);

Examples

  Specify collation for a column

   You can set a default collation for all values in a STRING column.

   For example, you can set a column's default collation to German (de):

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE de_names (name STRING COLLATE de PRIMARY KEY);

   When inserting values into this column, you must specify the collation for
   every value:

   copy

 > INSERT INTO de_names VALUES ('Backhaus' COLLATE de), ('Bär' COLLATE de), ('Baz' COLLATE de);

   The sort will now honor the de collation that treats ä as a in alphabetic
   sorting:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM de_names ORDER BY name;

     name
 +----------+
   Backhaus
   Bär
   Baz
 (3 rows)

  Order by non-default collation

   You can sort a column using a specific collation instead of its default.

   For example, you receive different results if you order results by German
   (de) and Swedish (sv) collations:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM de_names ORDER BY name COLLATE sv;

     name
 +----------+
   Backhaus
   Baz
   Bär
 (3 rows)

  Ad-hoc collation casting

   You can cast any string into a collation on the fly.

   copy

 > SELECT 'A' COLLATE de < 'Ä' COLLATE de;

   ?column?
 +----------+
     true
 (1 row)

   However, you cannot compare values with different collations:

   copy

 > SELECT 'Ä' COLLATE sv < 'Ä' COLLATE de;

 pq: unsupported comparison operator: <collatedstring{sv}> < <collatedstring{de}>

   You can also use casting to remove collations from values.

   copy

 > SELECT CAST(name AS STRING) FROM de_names ORDER BY name;

     name
 +----------+
   Backhaus
   Baz
   Bär
 (3 rows)

  Show collation for strings

   You can use the pg_collation_for built-in function, or its alternative
   syntax form COLLATION FOR, to return the locale name of a collated string.

   For example:

   copy

 > SELECT pg_collation_for('Bär' COLLATE de);

   pg_collation_for
 +------------------+
   de
 (1 row)

   This is equivalent to:

   copy

 > SELECT COLLATION FOR ('Bär' COLLATE de);

   pg_collation_for
 +------------------+
   de
 (1 row)
