                              VALIDATE CONSTRAINT

   The VALIDATE CONSTRAINT statement is part of ALTER TABLE and checks
   whether values in a column match a constraint on the column. This
   statement is especially useful after applying a constraint to an existing
   column via ADD CONSTRAINT. In this case, VALIDATE CONSTRAINT can be used
   to find values already in the column that do not match the constraint.

   Tip:

   This command can be combined with other ALTER TABLE commands in a single
   statement. For a list of commands that can be combined, see ALTER TABLE.
   For a demonstration, see Add and rename columns atomically.

Required privileges

   The user must have the CREATE privilege on the table.

Synopsis

   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS table_name VALIDATE CONSTRAINT constraint_name

Parameters

   Parameter       Description                                                
   table_name      The name of the table in which the constraint you'd like   
                   to validate lives.                                         
   constraint_name The name of the constraint on table_name you'd like to     
                   validate.                                                  

Viewing schema changes

   This schema change statement is registered as a job. You can view
   long-running jobs with SHOW JOBS.

Examples

   In ADD CONSTRAINT, we added a foreign key constraint like so:

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT customer_fk FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

   In order to ensure that the data added to the orders table prior to the
   creation of the customer_fk constraint conforms to that constraint, run
   the following:

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE orders VALIDATE CONSTRAINT customer_fk;

   Note:

   If present in a CREATE TABLE statement, the table is considered validated
   because an empty table trivially meets its constraints.
