   Orchestration systems automate the deployment, scaling, and management of
   containerized applications. Combined with CockroachDB's automated sharding
   and fault tolerance, they have the potential to lower operator overhead to
   almost nothing.

   Use the following guides to run CockroachDB with popular open-source
   orchestration systems:

     * Kubernetes Single-Cluster Deployment
     * Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Deployment
     * Kubernetes Performance Optimization
     * Docker Swarm Deployment
     * Mesosphere DC/OS Deployment
   Tip:
   If you're just getting started with CockroachDB, you might want to
   orchestrate a local cluster to learn the basics of the database.
