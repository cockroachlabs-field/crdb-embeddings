   EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT is a subcommand of ALTER TABLE that is used to turn SQL
   audit logging on or off for a table.

   The audit logs contain detailed information about queries being executed
   against your system, including:

     * Full text of the query (which may include personally identifiable
       information (PII))
     * Date/Time
     * Client address
     * Application name

   For a detailed description of exactly what is logged, see the Audit Log
   File Format section below.

   Warning:

   This is an experimental feature. The interface and output are subject to
   change.

   Tip:

   This command can be combined with other ALTER TABLE commands in a single
   statement. For a list of commands that can be combined, see ALTER TABLE.
   For a demonstration, see Add and rename columns atomically.

Synopsis

   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS table_name EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET READ WRITE OFF

Required privileges

   Only members of the admin role can enable audit logs on a table. By
   default, the root user belongs to the admin role.

Parameters

   Parameter  Description                                              
   table_name The name of the table you want to create audit logs for. 
   READ       Log all table reads to the audit log file.               
   WRITE      Log all table writes to the audit log file.              
   OFF        Turn off audit logging.                                  

   Note:

   As of version 2.0, this command logs all reads and writes, and both the
   READ and WRITE parameters are required (as shown in the examples below).
   In a future release, this should change to allow logging only reads, only
   writes, or both.

Audit log file format

   The audit log file format is as shown below. The numbers above each column
   are not part of the format; they correspond to the descriptions that
   follow.

    1. Date
    2. Time (in UTC)
    3. Goroutine ID. This column is used for troubleshooting CockroachDB and
       may change its meaning at any time.
    4. Where the log line was generated
    5. Logging tags (the contents and order may vary)
          * Client address
          * Username
          * Node ID
    6. Log entry counter
    7. Log message:
          * a. Label indicating where the data was generated (useful for
            troubleshooting)
          * b. Current value of the application_name session setting
          * c. Logging trigger:
               * The list of triggering tables and access modes for audit
                 logs, since only certain (read/write) activities are added
                 to the audit log
          * d. Full text of the query (Note: May contain PII)
          * e. Placeholder values, if any
          * f. Query execution time (in milliseconds)
          * g. Number of rows produced (e.g., for SELECT) or processed (e.g.,
            for INSERT or UPDATE).
          * h. Status of the query
               * OK for success
               * ERROR otherwise
          * i. Number of times the statement was retried automatically by the
            server so far.

Audit log file storage location

   By default, audit logs are stored in the same directory as the other logs
   generated by CockroachDB.

   To store the audit log files in a specific directory, pass the
   --sql-audit-dir flag to cockroach start.

   Tip:

   If your deployment requires particular lifecycle and access policies for
   audit log files, point --sql-audit-dir at a directory that has permissions
   set so that only CockroachDB can create/delete files.

Viewing schema changes

   This schema change statement is registered as a job. You can view
   long-running jobs with SHOW JOBS.

Examples

  Turn on audit logging

   Let's say you have a customers table that contains personally identifiable
   information (PII). To turn on audit logs for that table, run the following
   command:

   copy

 ALTER TABLE customers EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET READ WRITE;

   Now, every access of customer data is added to the audit log with a line
   that looks like the following:

 I180211 07:30:48.832004 317 sql/exec_log.go:90  [client=127.0.0.1:62503,user=root,n1] 13 exec "cockroach" {"customers"[53]:READ} "SELECT * FROM customers" {} 123.45 12 OK
 I180211 07:30:48.832004 317 sql/exec_log.go:90  [client=127.0.0.1:62503,user=root,n1] 13 exec "cockroach" {"customers"[53]:READ} "SELECT nonexistent FROM customers" {} 0.123 12 ERROR

   To turn on auditing for more than one table, issue a separate ALTER
   statement for each table.

   For a description of the log file format, see the Audit Log File Format
   section.

   Tip:

   For a more detailed example, see SQL Audit Logging.

  Turn off audit logging

   To turn off logging, issue the following command:

   copy

 ALTER TABLE customers EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET OFF;
