   The GRANT <roles> statement lets you add a role or user as a member to a
   role.

   Note:

   GRANT <roles> is no longer an enterprise feature and is now freely
   available in the core version of CockroachDB.

Synopsis

   GRANT role_name , TO user_name , WITH ADMIN OPTION

Required privileges

   The user granting role membership must be a role admin (i.e., members with
   the WITH ADMIN OPTION) or a member of the admin role.

   To grant membership to the admin role, the user must have WITH ADMIN
   OPTION on the admin role.

Considerations

     * Users and roles can be members of roles.
     * The root user is automatically created as an admin role and assigned
       the ALL privilege for new databases.
     * All privileges of a role are inherited by all its members.
     * Membership loops are not allowed (direct: A is a member of B is a
       member of A or indirect: A is a member of B is a member of C ... is a
       member of A).

Parameters

   Parameter         Description                                              
                     The name of the role to which you want to add members.   
   role_name         To add members to multiple roles, use a comma-separated  
                     list of role names.                                      
                     The name of the user or role to whom you want to grant   
   user_name         membership. To add multiple members, use a               
                     comma-separated list of user and/or role names.          
   WITH ADMIN OPTION Designate the user as an role admin. Role admins can     
                     grant or revoke membership for the specified role.
