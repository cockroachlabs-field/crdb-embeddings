   You can use CockroachDB in IntelliJ IDEA as a database data source, which
   lets you accomplish tasks like managing your database's schema from within
   your IDE.

Support

   As of CockroachDB v20.2, IntelliJ IDEA only has partial support. This
   means that the application is mostly functional, but its integration still
   has a few rough edges.

  Versions

   The level of support in this document was tested as of the following
   versions:

     * CockroachDB v19.1.0-beta.20190225
     * IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 18.1.3
     * PostgreSQL JDBC 41.1
   Note:

   This feature should also work with other JetBrains IDEs, such as PyCharm,
   but Cockroach Labs has not yet tested its integration.

  Warnings & Errors

   Users can expect to encounter the following behaviors when using
   CockroachDB within IntelliJ IDEA.

     * Warnings do not require any action on the user's end and can be
       ignored. Note that even if a message indicates that it is an "error",
       it can still be treated as a warning by this definition.
     * Errors require the user to take action to resolve the problem and
       cannot be ignored.

    Warnings

      [XXUUU] ERROR: could not decorrelate subquery...

   DBeaver - Select CockroachDB

   Displays once per load of schema.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      [42883] ERROR: unknown function: pg_function_is_visible() Failed to
      retrieve...

   DBeaver - Select CockroachDB

   Display periodically. Does not impact functionality.

    Errors

      [42703] org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: column "n.xmin" does not
      exist

   DBeaver - Select CockroachDB

   Requires setting Introspect using JDBC metadata (details below).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set CockroachDB as a Data Source in IntelliJ

    1. Launch the Database tool window. (View > Tool Windows > Database)
       DBeaver - Select CockroachDB
    2. Add a PostgreSQL data source. (New (+) > Data Source >
       PostgreSQL)DBeaver - Select CockroachDB
    3. On the General tab, enter your database's connection string:

       Field    Value                                                         
       Host     Your CockroachDB cluster's hostname                           
       Port     Your CockroachDB cluster's port. By default, CockroachDB uses 
                port 26257.                                                   
                The database you want to connect to. Note that CockroachDB's  
       Database notion of database differs from PostgreSQL's; you can see     
                your cluster's databases through the SHOW DATABASES command.  
       User     The user to connect as. By default, you can use root.         
       Password If your cluster uses password authentication, enter the       
                password.                                                     
       Driver   Select or install PostgreSQL using a version greater than or  
                equal to 41.1. (Older drivers have not been tested.)          

       DBeaver - Select CockroachDB

    4. Install or select a PostgreSQL driver. We recommend a version greater
       than or equal to 41.1.

    5. If your cluster uses SSL authentication, go to the SSH/SSL tab, select
       Use SSL and provide the location of your certificate files.

    6. Go to the Options tab, and then select Introspect using JDBC
       metadata.DBeaver - Select CockroachDB

    7. Click OK.

   You can now use IntelliJ's database tool window to interact with your
   CockroachDB cluster.
