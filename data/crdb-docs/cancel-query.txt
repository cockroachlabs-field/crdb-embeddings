                                  CANCEL QUERY

   The CANCEL QUERY statement cancels a running SQL query.

Considerations

     * Schema changes are treated differently than other SQL queries. You can
       use SHOW JOBS to monitor the progress of schema changes and CANCEL JOB
       to cancel schema changes that are taking longer than expected.
     * In rare cases where a query is close to completion when a cancellation
       request is issued, the query may run to completion.

Required privileges

   Members of the admin role (include root, which belongs to admin by
   default) can cancel any currently active. User that are not members of the
   admin role can cancel only their own currently active queries.

Synopsis

   CANCEL QUERY IF EXISTS query_id QUERIES IF EXISTS select_stmt

Parameters

   Parameter   Description                                                    
               A scalar expression that produces the ID of the query to       
               cancel.                                                        
   query_id                                                                   
               CANCEL QUERY accepts a single query ID. If a subquery is used  
               and returns multiple IDs, the CANCEL QUERY statement will      
               fail. To cancel multiple queries, use CANCEL QUERIES.          
   select_stmt A selection query whose result you want to cancel.             

Response

   When a query is successfully cancelled, CockroachDB sends a query
   execution canceled error to the client that issued the query.

     * If the canceled query was a single, stand-alone statement, no further
       action is required by the client.
     * If the canceled query was part of a larger, multi-statement
       transaction, the client should then issue a ROLLBACK statement.

Examples

  Cancel a query via the query ID

   In this example, we use the SHOW QUERIES statement to get the ID of a
   query and then pass the ID into the CANCEL QUERY statement:

 > SHOW QUERIES;

 +----------------------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+
 |             query_id             | node_id | username |              start               |              query               |   client_address   | application_name | distributed |   phase   |
 +----------------------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+
 | 14dacc1f9a781e3d0000000000000001 |       2 | mroach   | 2017-08-10 14:08:22.878113+00:00 | SELECT * FROM test.kv ORDER BY k | 192.168.0.72:56194 | test_app         | false       | executing |
 +----------------------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+
 | 14dacc206c47a9690000000000000002 |       2 | root     | 2017-08-14 19:11:05.309119+00:00 | SHOW CLUSTER QUERIES             | 127.0.0.1:50921    |                  | NULL        | preparing |
 +----------------------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+

  Cancel a query via a subquery

   In this example, we nest a SELECT clause that retrieves the ID of a query
   inside the CANCEL QUERY statement:

 > CANCEL QUERY (SELECT query_id FROM [SHOW CLUSTER QUERIES]
       WHERE client_address = '192.168.0.72:56194'
           AND username = 'mroach'
           AND query = 'SELECT * FROM test.kv ORDER BY k');

   Note:
   CANCEL QUERY accepts a single query ID. If a subquery is used and returns
   multiple IDs, the CANCEL QUERY statement will fail. To cancel multiple
   queries, use CANCEL QUERIES.
