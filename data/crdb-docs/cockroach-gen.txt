   The cockroach gen command can generate command-line interface (CLI)
   utilities (man pages and a bash autocompletion script), example SQL data
   suitable to populate test databases, and an HAProxy configuration file for
   load balancing a running cluster.

Subcommands

   Subcommand   Usage                                                         
   man          Generate man pages for CockroachDB.                           
                Generate bash or zsh autocompletion script for CockroachDB.   
   autocomplete                                                               
                Default: bash                                                 
                Generate example SQL datasets. You can also use the cockroach 
   example-data workload command to generate these sample datasets in a       
                persistent cluster and the cockroach demo <dataset> command   
                to generate these datasets in a temporary, in-memory cluster. 
                Generate an HAProxy config file for a running CockroachDB     
                cluster. The node addresses included in the config are those  
   haproxy      advertised by the nodes. Make sure hostnames are resolvable   
                and IP addresses are routable from HAProxy.                   
                                                                              
                Decommissioned nodes are excluded from the config file.

               The path where the haproxy.cfg file will be generated. If an   
               haproxy.cfg file already exists in the directory, it will be   
   --out       overwritten.                                                   
                                                                              
               Default: haproxy.cfg in the current directory                  
               If nodes were started with locality details, you can use the   
               --locality flag here to filter the nodes included in the       
               HAProxy config file, specifying the explicit locality tier(s)  
   --locality  or a regular expression to match against. This is useful in    
               cases where you want specific instances of HAProxy to route to 
               specific nodes. See the Generate an HAProxy configuration file 
               example for more details.                                      

  Logging

   By default, the gen command logs errors to stderr.

   If you need to troubleshoot this command's behavior, you can change its
   logging behavior.

Examples

  Generate man pages

   Generate man pages:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen man

   Move the man pages to the man directory:

   copy

 $ sudo mv man/man1/* /usr/share/man/man1

   Access man pages:

   copy

 $ man cockroach

  Generate a bash autocompletion script

   Generate bash autocompletion script:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen autocomplete

   Add the script to your .bashrc and .bash_profle:

   copy

 $ printf "\n\n#cockroach bash autocomplete\nsource '<path to>cockroach.bash'" >> ~/.bashrc

   copy

 $ printf "\n\n#cockroach bash autocomplete\nsource '<path to>cockroach.bash'" >> ~/.bash_profile

   You can now use tab to autocomplete cockroach commands.

  Generate example data

   Tip:

   You can also use the cockroach workload command to generate these sample
   datasets in a persistent cluster and the cockroach demo <dataset> command
   to generate these datasets in a temporary, in-memory cluster.

   To test out CockroachDB, you can generate an example startrek database,
   which contains 2 tables, episodes and quotes.

   copy

 $ cockroach gen example-data startrek | cockroach sql --insecure

 CREATE DATABASE
 SET
 DROP TABLE
 DROP TABLE
 CREATE TABLE
 INSERT 79
 CREATE TABLE
 INSERT 200

   Launch the built-in SQL client to view it:

   copy

 $ cockroach sql --insecure

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM startrek;

 +------------+
 | table_name |
 +------------+
 | episodes   |
 | quotes     |
 +------------+
 (2 rows)

   You can also generate an example intro database, which contains 1 table,
   mytable, with a hidden message:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen example-data intro | cockroach sql --insecure

 CREATE DATABASE
 SET
 DROP TABLE
 CREATE TABLE
 INSERT 1
 INSERT 1
 INSERT 1
 INSERT 1
 ...

   copy

 # Launch the built-in SQL client to view it:
 $ cockroach sql --insecure

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM intro;

 +-------------+
 | table_name  |
 +-------------+
 | mytable     |
 +-------------+
 (1 row)

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM intro.mytable WHERE (l % 2) = 0;

  Generate an HAProxy config file

   HAProxy is one of the most popular open-source TCP load balancers, and
   CockroachDB includes a built-in command for generating a configuration
   file that is preset to work with your running cluster.

   Secure Insecure

   To generate an HAProxy config file for an entire secure cluster, run the
   cockroach gen haproxy command, specifying the location of certificate
   directory and the address of any instance running a CockroachDB node:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen haproxy \
 --certs-dir=<path to certs directory> \
 --host=<address of any node in the cluster>

   To limit the HAProxy config file to nodes matching specific "localities",
   use the --localities flag, specifying the explicit locality tier(s) or a
   regular expression to match against:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen haproxy \
 --certs-dir=<path to certs directory> \
 --host=<address of any node in the cluster>
 --locality=region=us.*

   To generate an HAProxy config file for an entire insecure cluster, run the
   cockroach gen haproxy command, specifying the address of any instance
   running a CockroachDB node:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen haproxy \
 --insecure \
 --host=<address of any node in the cluster>

   To limit the HAProxy config file to nodes matching specific "localities",
   use the --localities flag, specifying the explicit locality tier(s) or a
   regular expression to match against:

   copy

 $ cockroach gen haproxy \
 --insecure \
 --host=<address of any node in the cluster>
 --locality=region=us.*

   By default, the generated configuration file is called haproxy.cfg and
   looks as follows, with the server addresses pre-populated correctly:

 global
   maxconn 4096

 defaults
     mode                tcp
     # Timeout values should be configured for your specific use.
     # See: https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html#4-timeout%20connect
     timeout connect     10s
     timeout client      1m
     timeout server      1m
     # TCP keep-alive on client side. Server already enables them.
     option              clitcpka

 listen psql
     bind :26257
     mode tcp
     balance roundrobin
     option httpchk GET /health?ready=1
     server cockroach1 <node1 address>:26257 check port 8080
     server cockroach2 <node2 address>:26257 check port 8080
     server cockroach3 <node3 address>:26257 check port 8080

   The file is preset with the minimal configurations needed to work with
   your running cluster:

   Field           Description                                                
   timeout connect Timeout values that should be suitable for most            
   timeout client  deployments.                                               
   timeout server  
                   The port that HAProxy listens on. This is the port clients 
                   will connect to and thus needs to be allowed by your       
                   network configuration.                                     
                                                                              
   bind            This tutorial assumes HAProxy is running on a separate     
                   machine from CockroachDB nodes. If you run HAProxy on the  
                   same machine as a node (not recommended), you'll need to   
                   change this port, as 26257 is likely already being used by 
                   the CockroachDB node.                                      
                   The balancing algorithm. This is set to roundrobin to      
                   ensure that connections get rotated amongst nodes          
   balance         (connection 1 on node 1, connection 2 on node 2, etc.).    
                   Check the HAProxy Configuration Manual for details about   
                   this and other balancing algorithms.                       
                   The HTTP endpoint that HAProxy uses to check node health.  
   option httpchk  /health?ready=1 ensures that HAProxy doesn't direct        
                   traffic to nodes that are live but not ready to receive    
                   requests.                                                  
                   For each included node, this field specifies the address   
                   the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, i.e.,   
   server          the addressed pass in the --advertise-addr flag on node    
                   startup. Make sure hostnames are resolvable and IP         
                   addresses are routable from HAProxy.                       

   Note:

   For full details on these and other configuration settings, see the
   HAProxy Configuration Manual.
