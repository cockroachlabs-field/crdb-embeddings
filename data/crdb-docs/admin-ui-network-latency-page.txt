   The Network Latency page displays round-trip latencies between all nodes
   in your cluster. Latency is the time required to transmit a packet across
   a network, and is highly dependent on your network topology. Use this page
   to determine whether your latency is appropriate for your topology
   pattern, or to identify nodes with unexpected latencies.

   To view this page, access the Admin UI and click Network Latency in the
   left-hand navigation.

Sort and filter network latency

   Use the Sort By menu to arrange the latency matrix by locality (e.g.,
   cloud, region, availability zone, datacenter).

   Use the Filter menu to select specific nodes or localities to view.

   Select Collapse Nodes to display the mean latencies of each locality,
   depending on how the matrix is sorted. This is a way to quickly assess
   cross-regional or cross-cloud latency.

Understanding the Network Latency matrix

   Each cell in the matrix displays the round-trip latency in milliseconds
   between two nodes in your cluster. Round-trip latency includes the return
   time of a packet. Latencies are color-coded by their standard deviation
   from the mean latency on the network: green for lower values, and blue for
   higher.

   Rows represent origin nodes, and columns represent destination nodes.
   Hover over a cell to see round-trip latency and locality metadata for
   origin and destination nodes.

   On a typical multi-region cluster, you can expect much lower latencies
   between nodes in the same region/availability zone. Nodes in different
   regions/availability zones, meanwhile, will experience higher latencies
   that reflect their geographical distribution.

   For instance, the cluster shown above has nodes in us-west1, us-east1, and
   europe-west2. Latencies are highest between nodes in us-west1 and
   europe-west2, which span the greatest distance. This is especially clear
   when sorting by region or availability zone and collapsing nodes:

  No connections

   Nodes that have lost a connection are displayed in a separate color. This
   can help you locate a network partition in your cluster.

   Note:

   A network partition prevents nodes from communicating with each other in
   one or both directions. This can be due to a configuration problem with
   the network, such as when allowlisted IP addresses or hostnames change
   after a node is torn down and rebuilt. In a symmetric partition, node
   communication is broken in both directions. In an asymmetric partition,
   node communication works in one direction but not the other.

   The effect of a network partition depends on which nodes are partitioned,
   where the ranges are located, and to a large extent, whether localities
   are defined. If localities are not defined, a partition that cuts off at
   least (n-1)/2 nodes will cause data unavailability.

   Click the NO CONNECTIONS link to see lost connections between nodes or
   localities, if any are defined.

Topology fundamentals

     * Multi-region topology patterns are almost always table-specific. If
       you haven't already, review the full range of patterns to ensure you
       choose the right one for each of your tables.
     * Review how data is replicated and distributed across a cluster, and
       how this affects performance. It is especially important to understand
       the concept of the "leaseholder". For a summary, see Reads and Writes
       in CockroachDB. For a deeper dive, see the CockroachDB Architecture
       documentation.
     * Review the concept of locality, which makes CockroachDB aware of the
       location of nodes and able to intelligently place and balance data
       based on how you define replication controls.
     * Review the recommendations and requirements in our Production
       Checklist.
     * This topology doesn't account for hardware specifications, so be sure
       to follow our hardware recommendations and perform a POC to size
       hardware for your use case.
     * Adopt relevant SQL Best Practices to ensure optimal performance.
   Note:

   Network latency limits the performance of individual operations. You can
   use the Statements page to see the latencies of SQL statements on gateway
   nodes.
