   The DROP COLUMN statement is part of ALTER TABLE and removes columns from
   a table.

   Tip:

   This command can be combined with other ALTER TABLE commands in a single
   statement. For a list of commands that can be combined, see ALTER TABLE.
   For a demonstration, see Add and rename columns atomically.

Synopsis

   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS table_name DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS name CASCADE
   RESTRICT

Required privileges

   The user must have the CREATE privilege on the table.

Parameters

   Parameter  Description                                                     
   table_name The name of the table with the column you want to drop.         
              The name of the column you want to drop.                        
   name                                                                       
              When a column with a CHECK constraint is dropped, the CHECK     
              constraint is also dropped.                                     
              Drop the column even if objects (such as views) depend on it;   
              drop the dependent objects, as well.                            
                                                                              
              CASCADE does not list objects it drops, so should be used       
   CASCADE    cautiously. However, CASCADE will not drop dependent indexes;   
              you must use DROP INDEX.                                        
                                                                              
              CASCADE will drop a column with a foreign key constraint if it  
              is the only column in the reference.                            
   RESTRICT   (Default) Do not drop the column if any objects (such as views) 
              depend on it.                                                   

Viewing schema changes

   This schema change statement is registered as a job. You can view
   long-running jobs with SHOW JOBS.

Examples

  Drop columns

   If you no longer want a column in a table, you can drop it.

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN billing_zip;

  Prevent dropping columns with dependent objects (RESTRICT)

   If the column has dependent objects, such as views, CockroachDB will not
   drop the column by default; however, if you want to be sure of the
   behavior you can include the RESTRICT clause.

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN customer RESTRICT;

 pq: cannot drop column "customer" because view "customer_view" depends on it

  Drop column and dependent objects (CASCADE)

   If you want to drop the column and all of its dependent options, include
   the CASCADE clause.

   Warning:
   CASCADE does not list objects it drops, so should be used cautiously.
   copy

 > SHOW CREATE customer_view;

 +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | table_name    | create_statement                                               |
 +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | customer_view | CREATE VIEW customer_view AS SELECT customer FROM store.orders |
 +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN customer CASCADE;

   copy

 > SHOW CREATE customer_view;

 pq: view "customer_view" does not exist
