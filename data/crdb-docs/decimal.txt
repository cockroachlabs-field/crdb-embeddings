   The DECIMAL data type stores exact, fixed-point numbers. This type is used
   when it is important to preserve exact precision, for example, with
   monetary data.

Aliases

   In CockroachDB, the following are aliases for DECIMAL:

     * DEC
     * NUMERIC

Precision and scale

   To limit a decimal column, use DECIMAL(precision, scale), where precision
   is the maximum count of digits both to the left and right of the decimal
   point and scale is the exact count of digits to the right of the decimal
   point. The precision must not be smaller than the scale. Also note that
   using DECIMAL(precision) is equivalent to DECIMAL(precision, 0).

   When inserting a decimal value:

     * If digits to the right of the decimal point exceed the column's scale,
       CockroachDB rounds to the scale.
     * If digits to the right of the decimal point are fewer than the
       column's scale, CockroachDB pads to the scale with 0s.
     * If digits to the left and right of the decimal point exceed the
       column's precision, CockroachDB gives an error.
     * If the column's precision and scale are identical, the inserted value
       must round to less than 1.

Syntax

   A constant value of type DECIMAL can be entered as a numeric literal. For
   example: 1.414 or -1234.

   The special IEEE754 values for positive infinity, negative infinity and
   NaN (Not-a-Number) cannot be entered using numeric literals directly and
   must be converted using an interpreted literal or an explicit conversion
   from a string literal instead.

   The following values are recognized:

   Syntax                         Value              
   inf, infinity, +inf, +infinity +∞                 
   -inf, -infinity                -∞                 
   nan                            NaN (Not-a-Number) 

   For example:

     * DECIMAL '+Inf'
     * '-Inf'::DECIMAL
     * CAST('NaN' AS DECIMAL)

Size

   The size of a DECIMAL value is variable, starting at 9 bytes. It's
   recommended to keep values under 64 kilobytes to ensure performance. Above
   that threshold, write amplification and other considerations may cause
   significant performance degradation.

Examples

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE decimals (a DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY, b DECIMAL(10,5), c NUMERIC);

   copy

 > SHOW COLUMNS FROM decimals;

   column_name |   data_type   | is_nullable | column_default | generation_expression |  indices  | is_hidden
 --------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-----------+------------
   a           | DECIMAL       |    false    | NULL           |                       | {primary} |   false
   b           | DECIMAL(10,5) |    true     | NULL           |                       | {}        |   false
   c           | DECIMAL       |    true     | NULL           |                       | {}        |   false
 (3 rows)

   copy

 > INSERT INTO decimals VALUES (1.01234567890123456789, 1.01234567890123456789, 1.01234567890123456789);

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM decimals;

             a            |    b    |           c
 -------------------------+---------+-------------------------
   1.01234567890123456789 | 1.01235 | 1.01234567890123456789
 (1 row)

   The value in column a matches what was inserted exactly. The value in
   column b has been rounded to the column's scale. The value in column c is
   handled like the value in column a because NUMERIC is an alias for
   DECIMAL.

Supported casting and conversion

   DECIMAL values can be cast to any of the following data types:

   Type   Details                                                             
   INT    Truncates decimal precision                                         
          Loses precision and may round up to +/- infinity if the value is    
   FLOAT  too large in magnitude, or to +/-0 if the value is too small in     
          magnitude                                                           
   BOOL   0 converts to false; all other values convert to true               
   STRING ––
