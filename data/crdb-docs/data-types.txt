Data type conversions and casts

   CockroachDB supports explicit type conversions using the following
   methods:

     * <type> 'string literal', to convert from the literal representation of
       a value to a value of that type. For example: DATE '2008-12-21', INT
       '123', or BOOL 'true'.

     * <value>::<data type>, or its equivalent longer form CAST(<value> AS
       <data type>), which converts an arbitrary expression of one built-in
       type to another (this is also known as type coercion or "casting").
       For example: NOW()::DECIMAL, VARIANCE(a+2)::INT.

       Tip:

       To create constant values, consider using a type annotation instead of
       a cast, as it provides more predictable results.

     * Other built-in conversion functions when the type is not a SQL type,
       for example from_ip(), to_ip() to convert IP addresses between STRING
       and BYTES values.

   CockroachDB also supports implicit casting from string literals to INT and
   DECIMAL ARRAYs, where appropriate. For an example, see Implicit casting to
   INT and DECIMAL ARRAYs.

   You can find each data type's supported conversion and casting on its
   respective page in its section Supported casting & conversion.
