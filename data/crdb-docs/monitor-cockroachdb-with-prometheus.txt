   CockroachDB generates detailed time series metrics for each node in a
   cluster. This page shows you how to pull these metrics into Prometheus, an
   open source tool for storing, aggregating, and querying time series data.
   It also shows you how to connect Grafana and Alertmanager to Prometheus
   for flexible data visualizations and notifications.

   Tip:
   For details about other monitoring options, see Monitoring and Alerting.

Before you begin

     * Make sure you have already started a CockroachDB cluster, either
       locally or in a production environment.

     * Note that all files used in this tutorial can be found in the
       monitoring directory of the CockroachDB repository.

Step 1. Install Prometheus

    1. Download the 2.x Prometheus tarball for your OS.

    2. Extract the binary and add it to your PATH. This makes it easy to
       start Prometheus from any shell.

    3. Make sure Prometheus installed successfully:

       copy

 $ prometheus --version

 prometheus, version 2.2.1 (branch: HEAD, revision: bc6058c81272a8d938c05e75607371284236aadc)
   build user:       root@149e5b3f0829
   build date:       20180314-14:21:40
   go version:       go1.10

Step 2. Configure Prometheus

    1. Download the starter Prometheus configuration file for CockroachDB:

       copy

 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/prometheus.yml \
 -O prometheus.yml

       When you examine the configuration file, you'll see that it is set up
       to scrape the time series metrics of a single, insecure local node
       every 10 seconds:

          * scrape_interval: 10s defines the scrape interval.
          * metrics_path: '/_status/vars' defines the Prometheus-specific
            CockroachDB endpoint for scraping time series metrics.
          * scheme: 'http' specifies that the cluster being scraped is
            insecure.
          * targets: ['localhost:8080'] specifies the hostname and http-port
            of the Cockroach node to collect time series metrics on.
    2. Edit the configuration file to match your deployment scenario:

       Scenario           Config Change                                       
       Multi-node local   Expand the targets field to include                 
       cluster            'localhost:<http-port>' for each additional node.   
                          Change the targets field to include                 
       Production cluster '<hostname>:<http-port>' for each node in the       
                          cluster. Also, be sure your network configuration   
                          allows TCP communication on the specified ports.    
       Secure cluster     Uncomment scheme: 'https' and comment out scheme:   
                          'http'.                                             

    3. Create a rules directory and download the aggregation rules and
       alerting rules for CockroachDB into it:

       copy

 $ mkdir rules

       copy

 $ cd rules

       copy

 $ wget -P rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/rules/aggregation.rules.yml

       copy

 $ wget -P rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/rules/alerts.rules.yml

Step 3. Start Prometheus

    1. Start the Prometheus server, with the --config.file flag pointing to
       the configuration file:

       copy

 $ prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml

 INFO[0000] Starting prometheus (version=1.4.1, branch=master, revision=2a89e8733f240d3cd57a6520b52c36ac4744ce12)  source=main.go:77
 INFO[0000] Build context (go=go1.7.3, user=root@e685d23d8809, date=20161128-10:02:41)  source=main.go:78
 INFO[0000] Loading configuration file prometheus.yml     source=main.go:250
 INFO[0000] Loading series map and head chunks...         source=storage.go:354
 INFO[0000] 0 series loaded.                              source=storage.go:359
 INFO[0000] Listening on :9090                            source=web.go:248
 INFO[0000] Starting target manager...                    source=targetmanager.go:63

    2. Point your browser to http://<hostname of machine running
       prometheus>:9090, where you can use the Prometheus UI to query,
       aggregate, and graph CockroachDB time series metrics.

          * Prometheus auto-completes CockroachDB time series metrics for
            you, but if you want to see a full listing, with descriptions,
            point your browser to http://<hostname of a CockroachDB
            node>:8080/_status/vars.
          * For more details on using the Prometheus UI, see their official
            documentation.

Step 4. Send notifications with Alertmanager

   Active monitoring helps you spot problems early, but it is also essential
   to send notifications when there are events that require investigation or
   intervention. In step 2, you already downloaded CockroachDB's starter
   alerting rules. Now, download, configure, and start Alertmanager.

    1. Download the latest Alertmanager tarball for your OS.

    2. Extract the binary and add it to your PATH. This makes it easy to
       start Alertmanager from any shell.

    3. Make sure Alertmanager installed successfully:

       copy

 $ alertmanager --version

 alertmanager, version 0.15.0-rc.1 (branch: HEAD, revision: acb111e812530bec1ac6d908bc14725793e07cf3)
   build user:       root@f278953f13ef
   build date:       20180323-13:07:06
   go version:       go1.10

    4. Edit the Alertmanager configuration file that came with the binary,
       simple.yml, to specify the desired receivers for notifications.

    5. Start the Alertmanager server, with the --config.file flag pointing to
       the configuration file:

       copy

 $ alertmanager --config.file=simple.yml

    6. Point your browser to http://<hostname of machine running
       alertmanager>:9093, where you can use the Alertmanager UI to define
       rules for silencing alerts.

Step 5. Visualize metrics in Grafana

   Although Prometheus lets you graph metrics, Grafana is a much more
   powerful visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus easily.

    1. Install and start Grafana for your OS.

    2. Point your browser to http://<hostname of machine running
       grafana>:3000 and log into the Grafana UI with the default
       username/password, admin/admin, or create your own account.

    3. Add Prometheus as a datasource, and configure the datasource as
       follows:

       Field   Definition                                           
       Name    Prometheus                                           
       Default True                                                 
       Type    Prometheus                                           
       Url     http://<hostname of machine running prometheus>:9090 
       Access  Direct                                               

    4. Download the starter Grafana dashboards for CockroachDB:

       copy

 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/grafana-dashboards/runtime.json
 # runtime dashboard: node status, including uptime, memory, and cpu.

       copy

 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/grafana-dashboards/storage.json
 # storage dashboard: storage availability.

       copy

 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/grafana-dashboards/sql.json
 # sql dashboard: sql queries/transactions.

       copy

 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/monitoring/grafana-dashboards/replicas.json
 # replicas dashboard: replica information and operations.

    5. Add the dashboards to Grafana.
