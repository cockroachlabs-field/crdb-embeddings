   The REVOKE <roles> statement lets you revoke a role or user's membership
   to a role.

   Note:

   REVOKE <roles> is no longer an enterprise feature and is now freely
   available in the core version of CockroachDB.

Synopsis

   REVOKE ADMIN OPTION FOR role_name , FROM user_name ,

Required privileges

   The user revoking role membership must be a role admin (i.e., members with
   the WITH ADMIN OPTION) or a member of the admin role.

   To remove membership to the admin role, the user must have WITH ADMIN
   OPTION on the admin role.

Considerations

     * The root user cannot be revoked from the admin role.
