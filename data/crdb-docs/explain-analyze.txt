                                EXPLAIN ANALYZE

   The EXPLAIN ANALYZE statement executes a SQL query and generates a URL for
   a physical query plan with execution statistics, or a URL to download a
   bundle with more details about the query plan. Query plans provide
   information around SQL execution, which can be used to troubleshoot slow
   queries by figuring out where time is being spent, how long a processor
   (i.e., a component that takes streams of input rows and processes them
   according to a specification) is not doing work, etc. For more information
   about distributed SQL queries, see the DistSQL section of our SQL Layer
   Architecture docs.

   Note:

   The generated physical query plan is encoded into a byte string after the
   fragment identifier (#) in the generated URL. The fragment is not sent to
   the web server; instead, the browser waits for the web server to return a
   decode.html resource, and then JavaScript on the web page decodes the
   fragment into a physical query plan diagram. The query plan is, therefore,
   not logged by a server external to the CockroachDB cluster and not exposed
   to the public internet.

Aliases

   In CockroachDB, the following are aliases for EXPLAIN ANALYZE:

     * EXPLAIN ANALYSE

Synopsis

   EXPLAIN ANALYZE ANALYSE ( DISTSQL DEBUG , ) preparable_stmt

Parameters

   Parameter       Description                                                
   DISTSQL         (Default) Generate a link to a distributed SQL physical    
                   query plan tree. For more information, see Default option. 
                   Generate a ZIP file containing files with detailed         
   DEBUG           information about the query and the database objects       
                   referenced in the query. For more information, see DEBUG   
                   option.                                                    
   preparable_stmt The statement you want to execute and analyze. All         
                   preparable statements are explainable.                     

Required privileges

   The user requires the appropriate privileges for the statement being
   explained.

Success responses

   Successful EXPLAIN ANALYZE (and EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)) statements
   return a table with the following columns:

   Column    Description                                                      
             If true, the query is distributed. For more information about    
   automatic distributed SQL queries, see the DistSQL section of our SQL      
             Layer Architecture docs.                                         
             The URL generated for a physical query plan that provides high   
             level information about how a query will be executed. For        
             details about reading the physical query plan, see DistSQL Plan  
             Viewer.                                                          
                                                                              
             The generated physical query plan is encoded into a byte string  
   url       after the fragment identifier (#) in the generated URL. The      
             fragment is not sent to the web server; instead, the browser     
             waits for the web server to return a decode.html resource, and   
             then JavaScript on the web page decodes the fragment into a      
             physical query plan diagram. The query plan is, therefore, not   
             logged by a server external to the CockroachDB cluster and not   
             exposed to the public internet.                                  

   If you use the DEBUG option, the statement will return a single text
   column with a URL and instructions to download the DEBUG bundle, which
   includes the physical query plan.

Default option

   By default, EXPLAIN ANALYZE uses the DISTQL option, which generates a
   physical query plan diagram in the DistSQL Plan Viewer. EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   and EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL) produce the same output.

  DistSQL Plan Viewer

   The DistSQL Plan Viewer displays the physical query plan, as well as
   execution statistics:

   Field                  Description                                         
                          The processor and processor ID used to read data    
                          into the SQL execution engine.                      
                                                                              
   <ProcessorName>/<n>    A processor is a component that takes streams of    
                          input rows, processes them according to a           
                          specification, and outputs one stream of rows. For  
                          example, an "aggregator" aggregates input rows.     
   <index>@<table>        The index used.                                     
   Out                    The output columns.                                 
   @<n>                   The index of the column relative to the input.      
   Render                 The stage that renders the output.                  
                          (Blue box) A synchronizer that takes one or more    
                          output streams and merges them to be consumable by  
   unordered / ordered    a processor. An ordered synchronizer is used to     
                          merge ordered streams and keeps the rows in sorted  
                          order.                                              
   <data type>            If EXPLAIN(DISTSQL, TYPES) is specified, lists the  
                          data types of the input columns.                    
   left(@<n>)=right(@<n>) The equality columns used in the join.              
   rows read              The number of rows read by the processor.           
                          How long the processor spent not doing work. This   
   stall time             is aggregated into the stall time numbers as the    
                          query progresses down the tree (i.e., stall time is 
                          added up and overlaps with previous time).          
   stored side            The smaller table that was stored as an in-memory   
                          hash table.                                         
   max memory used        How much memory (if any) is used to buffer rows.    
                          (Orange box) The router, which is a component that  
                          takes one stream of input rows and sends them to a  
                          node according to a routing algorithm.              
   by hash                                                                    
                          For example, a hash router hashes columns of a row  
                          and sends the results to the node that is           
                          aggregating the result rows.                        
                          How much disk (if any) is used to buffer rows.      
   max disk used          Routers and processors will spill to disk buffering 
                          if there is not enough memory to buffer the rows.   
   rows routed            How many rows were sent by routers, which can be    
                          used to understand network usage.                   
                          The number of actual bytes sent (i.e., encoding of  
   bytes sent             the rows). This is only relevant when doing network 
                          communication.                                      
   Response               The response back to the client.                    

   Note:

   Any or all of the above fields may display for a given query plan.

DEBUG option

   EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG) executes a query and generates a link to a ZIP
   file that contains the physical query plan, execution statistics,
   statement tracing, and other information about the query.

   File              Description                                              
   stats-<table>.sql Contains statistics for a table in the query.            
   schema.sql        Contains CREATE statements for objects in the query.     
   env.sql           Contains information about the CockroachDB environment.  
   trace.json        Contains statement traces.                               
   distsql.html      The query's physical query plan. This diagram is         
                     identical to the one generated by EXPLAIN(DISTSQL)       
   plan.txt          The query execution plan. This is identical to the       
                     output of EXPLAIN (VERBOSE).                             
                     The query plan tree generated by the cost-based          
   opt-vv.txt        optimizer, with cost details and input column data       
                     types. This is identical to the output of EXPLAIN (OPT,  
                     TYPES).                                                  
                     The query plan tree generated by the cost-based          
   opt-v.txt         optimizer, with cost details. This is identical to the   
                     output of EXPLAIN (OPT, VERBOSE).                        
                     The query plan tree generated by the cost-based          
   opt.txt           optimizer. This is identical to the output of EXPLAIN    
                     (OPT).                                                   
   statement.txt     The SQL statement for the query.                         

   You can obtain this ZIP file by following the link provided in the EXPLAIN
   ANALYZE (DEBUG) output, or by navigating to Advanced Debug -> Statement
   Diagnostics History in the Admin UI.

Examples

  EXPLAIN ANALYZE

   Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE without an option, or equivalently with the DISTSQL
   option, to execute a query and generate a link to a physical query plan
   with execution statistics.

   For example, the following EXPLAIN ANALYZE statement executes a simple
   query against the TPC-H database loaded to a 3-node CockroachDB cluster,
   and then generates a link to a physical query plan with execution
   statistics:

   copy

 > EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT l_shipmode, AVG(l_extendedprice) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_shipmode;

   automatic |                      url                     
 ------------+-----------------------------------------------
     true    | https://cockroachdb.github.io/distsqlplan...

   To view the DistSQL Plan Viewer, point your browser to the URL provided:

   EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)

  EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)

   Use the DEBUG option to generate a ZIP file containing files with
   information about the query and the database objects referenced in the
   query. For example:

   copy

 > EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG) SELECT l_shipmode, AVG(l_extendedprice) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_shipmode;

                                       text
