   Mac Linux Windows

   See Release Notes for what's new in the latest release, v20.2.0-alpha.2.
   To upgrade to this release from an older version, see Cluster Upgrade.

Download the executable

   Warning:
   The CockroachDB executable for Windows is experimental and not suitable
   for production deployments. Windows 8 or higher is required.
    1. Download and extract the CockroachDB v20.2.0-alpha.2 archive for
       Windows.

    2. To ensure that CockroachDB can use location-based names as time zone
       identifiers, download Go's official zoneinfo.zip and set the ZONEINFO
       environment variable to point to the zip file.

    3. Open PowerShell, navigate to the directory containing the executable,
       and make sure it works:

       copy

 PS C:\cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.windows-6.2-amd64> .\cockroach.exe version

    4. Keep up-to-date with CockroachDB releases and best practices:

Use Kubernetes

   To orchestrate CockroachDB locally using Kubernetes, either with
   configuration files or the Helm package manager, see Orchestrate
   CockroachDB Locally with Minikube.

Use Docker

   Warning:
   Running a stateful application like CockroachDB in Docker is more complex
   and error-prone than most uses of Docker. Unless you are very experienced
   with Docker, we recommend starting with a different installation and
   deployment method.
    1. Install Docker for Windows.

       Docker for Windows requires 64bit Windows 10 Pro and Microsoft
       Hyper-V. Please see the official documentation for more details. Note
       that if your system does not satisfy the stated requirements, you can
       try using Docker Toolbox.
    2. Open PowerShell and confirm that the Docker daemon is running in the
       background:

       copy

 PS C:\Users\username> docker version

       If you do not see the server listed, start Docker for Windows.

    3. Share your local drives. This makes it possible to mount local
       directories as data volumes to persist node data after containers are
       stopped or deleted.

    4. Pull the image for the v20.2.0-alpha.2 release of CockroachDB from
       Docker Hub:

       copy

 PS C:\Users\username> docker pull cockroachdb/cockroach-unstable:v20.2.0-alpha.2

    5. Keep up-to-date with CockroachDB releases and best practices:

What's next?

     * If you're just getting started with CockroachDB:
          * Start a cluster locally and talk to it via the built-in SQL
            client
          * Learn more about CockroachDB SQL
          * Build a simple application with CockroachDB using
            Postgres-compatible client drivers and ORMs
          * Explore core CockroachDB features like automatic replication,
            rebalancing, and fault tolerance
     * If you're ready to run CockroachDB in production:
          * Review the Production Checklist
          * Deploy CockroachDB manually or use an orchestration system like
            Kubernetes
   Note:
   By default, each node of a CockroachDB cluster periodically shares
   anonymous usage details with Cockroach Labs. For an explanation of the
   details that get shared and how to opt-out of reporting, see Diagnostics
   Reporting.
