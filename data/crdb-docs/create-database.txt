   The CREATE DATABASE statement creates a new CockroachDB database.

   Note:

   This statement performs a schema change. For more information about how
   online schema changes work in CockroachDB, see Online Schema Changes.

Required privileges

   Only members of the admin role can create new databases. By default, the
   root user belongs to the admin role.

Synopsis

   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS name WITH ENCODING = encoding

Parameters

   Parameter     Description                                                  
                 Create a new database only if a database of the same name    
   IF NOT EXISTS does not already exist; if one does exist, do not return an  
                 error.                                                       
   name          The name of the database to create, which must be unique and 
                 follow these identifier rules.                               
                 The CREATE DATABASE statement accepts an optional ENCODING   
                 clause for compatibility with PostgreSQL, but UTF-8 is the   
                 only supported encoding. The aliases UTF8 and UNICODE are    
   encoding      also accepted. Values should be enclosed in single quotes    
                 and are case-insensitive.                                    
                                                                              
                 Example: CREATE DATABASE bank ENCODING = 'UTF-8'.            

Example

  Create a database

   copy

 > CREATE DATABASE bank;

   copy

 > SHOW DATABASES;

 +---------------+
 | database_name |
 +---------------+
 | bank          |
 | defaultdb     |
 | postgres      |
 | system        |
 +---------------+
 (4 rows)

  Create fails (name already in use)

   copy

 > CREATE DATABASE bank;

 pq: database "bank" already exists

   copy

 > CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS bank;

   SQL does not generate an error, but instead responds CREATE DATABASE even
   though a new database wasn't created.

   copy

 > SHOW DATABASES;

 +---------------+
 | database_name |
 +---------------+
 | bank          |
 | defaultdb     |
 | postgres      |
 | system        |
 +---------------+
 (4 rows)
