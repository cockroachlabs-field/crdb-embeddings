   This tutorial walks you through developing and deploying a multi-region
   web application built on CockroachDB, using Flask, SQLAlchemy,
   CockroachCloud, and Google Cloud Platform services.

   The following sections make up the tutorial:

    1. MovR: An Example Multi-Region Use-Case
    2. Create a Multi-Region Database Schema
    3. Set Up a Virtual Environment for Developing Multi-Region Applications
    4. Develop a Multi-Region Web Application
    5. Deploy a Multi-Region Web Application

   Throughout the tutorial, we reference the source code for an example web
   application for the fictional vehicle-sharing company MovR. The source
   code for this application is open source and available on GitHub, in the
   movr-flask repo. The code is well-commented, with docstrings defined at
   the beginning of each class and function definition. The repo's README
   also includes instructions on debugging and deploying the application
   using Google Cloud services. Those instructions are reproduced in Setting
   Up a Virtual Environment for Developing Multi-Region Applications and
   Deploying a Multi-Region Web Application.

   Tip:

   For a live demo of the deployed MovR Flask application, see
