                               Migration Overview

   CockroachDB supports importing data from the following databases:

     * MySQL
     * Oracle (using CSV)
     * Postgres

   and from the following data formats:

     * CSV/TSV

   This page lists general considerations to be aware of as you plan your
   migration to CockroachDB.

   In addition to the information listed below, see the following pages for
   specific instructions and considerations that apply to the database (or
   data format) you're migrating from:

     * Migrate from Oracle
     * Migrate from Postgres
     * Migrate from MySQL
     * Migrate from CSV

File storage during import

   During migration, all of the features of IMPORT that interact with
   external file storage assume that every node has the exact same view of
   that storage. In other words, in order to import from a file, every node
   needs to have the same access to that file.

Schema and application changes

   In general, you are likely to have to make changes to your schema, and how
   your app interacts with the database. We strongly recommend testing your
   application against CockroachDB to ensure that:

    1. The state of your data is what you expect post-migration.
    2. Performance is as expected for your application's workloads. You may
       need to apply some best practices for optimizing SQL performance in
       CockroachDB.

Data type sizes

   Above a certain size, many data types such as STRINGs, DECIMALs, ARRAY,
   BYTES, and JSONB may run into performance issues due to write
   amplification. See each data type's documentation for its recommended size
   limits.

Unsupported data types

   CockroachDB does not provide ENUM or SET data types.

   In Postgres, you can emulate an ENUM type using a CHECK constraint as
   shown below. For MySQL, we perform this conversion automatically during
   the import.

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE orders (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     -- ...
     status STRING check (
       status='processing' or status='in-transit' or status='delivered'
     ) NOT NULL,
     -- ...
   );
