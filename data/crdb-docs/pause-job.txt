   The PAUSE JOB statement lets you pause IMPORT jobs, enterprise BACKUP and
   RESTORE jobs, user-created table statistics jobs, automatic table
   statistics jobs, changefeeds, and schema change jobs.

   After pausing jobs, you can resume them with RESUME JOB.

Required privileges

   By default, only the root user can control a job.

Synopsis

   PAUSE JOB job_id JOBS select_stmt

Parameters

   Parameter   Description                                                    
   job_id      The ID of the job you want to pause, which can be found with   
               SHOW JOBS.                                                     
   select_stmt A selection query that returns job_id(s) to pause.             

Examples

  Pause a single job

   copy

 > SHOW JOBS;

 +----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
 |       id       |  type   |               description                 |...
 +----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
 | 27536791415282 | RESTORE | RESTORE db.* FROM 'azure://backup/db/tbl' |...
 +----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...

   copy

 > PAUSE JOB 27536791415282;

  Pause multiple jobs

   To pause multiple jobs, nest a SELECT clause that retrieves job_id(s)
   inside the PAUSE JOBS statement:

   copy

 > PAUSE JOBS (SELECT job_id FROM [SHOW JOBS]
       WHERE user_name = 'maxroach');

   All jobs created by maxroach will be paused.

  Pause automatic table statistics jobs

   copy

 > SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS;

         job_id       |       job_type      |                    description                      |...
 +--------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+...
   438235476849557505 | AUTO CREATE STATS   | Table statistics refresh for defaultdb.public.users |...
 (1 row)

   copy

 > PAUSE JOB 438235476849557505;

   To permanently disable automatic table statistics jobs, disable the
   sql.stats.automatic_collection.enabled cluster setting:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.stats.automatic_collection.enabled = false;
