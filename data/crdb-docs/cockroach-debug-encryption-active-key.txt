   The cockroach debug encryption-active-key command displays the encryption
   algorithm and store key for an encrypted store.

Synopsis

 $ cockroach debug encryption-active-key [path specified by the store flag]

Subcommands

   While the cockroach debug command has a few subcommands, users are
   expected to use only the zip, encryption-active-key, merge-logs, and
   ballast subcommands.

   The other debug subcommands are useful only to CockroachDB's developers
   and contributors.

Example

   Start a node with encryption-at-rest enabled:

   copy

 $ cockroach start --store=cockroach-data --enterprise-encryption=path=cockroach-data,key=aes-128.key,old-key=plain --insecure --certs-dir=certs

   View the encryption algorithm and store key:

   copy

 $ cockroach debug encryption-active-key cockroach-data

 AES128_CTR:be235c29239aa84a48e5e1874d76aebf7fb3c1bdc438cec2eb98de82f06a57a0
