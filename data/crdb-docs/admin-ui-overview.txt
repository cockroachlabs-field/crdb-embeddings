   The CockroachDB Admin UI provides details about your cluster and database
   configuration, and helps you optimize cluster performance.

                         Metrics about how data is replicated across the      
   Replication Dashboard cluster, e.g., range status, replicas per store, and 
                         replica quiescence.

                         cluster.                                             
   Databases             Details about the system and user databases in the   
                         cluster.                                             
   Statements            Frequently executed and high latency SQL statements, 
                         with the option to collect statement diagnostics.    
   Network Latency       Latencies and lost connections between all nodes in  
                         your cluster.                                        
   Jobs                  Details of jobs running in the cluster.              
                         Advanced monitoring and troubleshooting reports.     
                         These include details about data distribution, the   
   Advanced Debug        state of specific queues, and slow query metrics.    
                         These details are largely intended for use by        
                         CockroachDB developers.                              

Admin UI access

   The Admin UI is accessible from every node at http://<host>:<http-port>,
   or http://<host>:8080 by default.

     * If you included the --http-addr flag when starting nodes, use the IP
       address/hostname and port specified by that flag.
     * If you didn't include the --http-addr flag when starting nodes, use
       the IP address/hostname specified by the --listen-addr flag and port
       8080.
     * If you are running a secure cluster, use https instead of http.
   Tip:

   For guidance on accessing the Admin UI in the context of cluster
   deployment, see Start a Local Cluster and Manual Deployment.

  Admin UI security

   On insecure clusters, all areas of the Admin UI are accessible to all
   users.

   On secure clusters, for each user who should have access to the Admin UI,
   you must create a user with a password and optionally grant the user
   membership to the admin role.

   Note:

   The default root user is a member of the admin role. Use the following
   command to grant users membership to the admin role:

   GRANT admin TO <sql_user>;

   For security reasons, non-admin users access only the data over which they
   have privileges (e.g., their tables, jobs, and list of sessions), and data
   that does not require privileges (e.g., cluster health, node status,
   metrics).

   The following areas of the Admin UI can only be accessed by admin users.
   These areas display information from privileged HTTP endpoints that
   operate with admin privilege.

   Secure area          Privileged information                                
   Node Map             Database and table names                              
   Databases            Stored table data                                     
   Statements           SQL statements                                        
   Advanced Debug (some Stored table data, operational details, internal IP   
   reports)             addresses, names, credentials, application data       
                        (depending on report)                                 

   Note:

   By default, the Admin UI shares anonymous usage details with Cockroach
   Labs. For information about the details shared and how to opt-out of
   reporting, see Diagnostics Reporting.
