   The SHOW USERS statement lists the users for all databases.

   Note:

   Since the keywords ROLES and USERS can now be used interchangeably in SQL
   statements for enhanced Postgres compatibility, SHOW USERS is now an alias
   for SHOW ROLES.

Synopsis

   SHOW USERS

Required privileges

   The user must have the SELECT privilege on the system.users and
   system.role_members tables.

Example

   copy

 > SHOW USERS;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | NOLOGIN    | {}
   petee    |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (4 rows)

   Alternatively, within the built-in SQL shell, you can use the \du shell
   command:

   copy

 > \du

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | NOLOGIN    | {}
   petee    |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (4 rows)
