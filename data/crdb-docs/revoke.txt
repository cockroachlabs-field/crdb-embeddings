   The REVOKE <privileges> statement revokes privileges from users and/or
   roles.

   For the list of privileges that can be granted to and revoked from users
   and roles, see GRANT.

Synopsis

   REVOKE ALL CREATE GRANT SELECT DROP INSERT DELETE UPDATE , ON TABLE
   table_name , DATABASE database_name , FROM user_name ,

Required privileges

   The user revoking privileges must have the GRANT privilege on the target
   databases or tables.

   In addition to the GRANT privilege, the user revoking privileges must have
   the privilege being revoked on the target database or tables. For example,
   a user revoking the SELECT privilege on a table to another user must have
   the GRANT and SELECT privileges on that table.

Parameters

   Parameter     Description                                                  
                 The name of the table for which you want to revoke           
   table_name    privileges. To revoke privileges for multiple tables, use a  
                 comma-separated list of table names. To revoke privileges    
                 for all tables, use *.                                       
                 The name of the database for which you want to revoke        
                 privileges. To revoke privileges for multiple databases, use 
   database_name a comma-separated list of database names.                    
                                                                              
                 Privileges revoked for databases will be revoked for any new 
                 tables created in the databases.                             
   user_name     A comma-separated list of users and/or roles from whom you   
                 want to revoke privileges.                                   

Examples

  Revoke privileges on databases

   copy

 > SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE db1, db2;

 +----------+------------+------------+
 | Database |    User    | Privileges |
 +----------+------------+------------+
 | db1      | betsyroach | CREATE     |
 | db1      | maxroach   | CREATE     |
 | db1      | root       | ALL        |
 | db2      | betsyroach | CREATE     |
 | db2      | maxroach   | CREATE     |
 | db2      | root       | ALL        |
 +----------+------------+------------+
 (6 rows)

   copy
