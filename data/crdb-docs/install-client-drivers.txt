   CockroachDB supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so most available
   PostgreSQL client drivers and ORMs should work with CockroachDB. Choose a
   language for supported clients and installation steps.

   Note:

   Applications may encounter incompatibilities when using advanced or
   obscure features of a driver or ORM with beta-level support. If you
   encounter problems, please open an issue with details to help us make
   progress toward full support.

Drivers

  psycopg2

   Support level: Full

   To install the Python psycopg2 driver:

   copy

 $ pip install psycopg2

   For other ways to install psycopg2, see the official documentation.

   For a simple but complete "Hello World" example app, see Build a Python
   App with CockroachDB and psycopg2.

   To install SQLAlchemy and a CockroachDB Python package that accounts for
   some differences between CockroachDB and PostgreSQL:

   copy

 $ pip install sqlalchemy sqlalchemy-cockroachdb psycopg2

   You can substitute psycopg2 for other alternatives that include the
   psycopg python package.

   For other ways to install SQLAlchemy, see the official documentation.

  Django

   Support level: Full

   CockroachDB supports Django versions 2.2 and 3.0.

   To install Django:

   copy

 $ python -m pip install django==3.0.*

   Before installing the CockroachDB backend for Django, you must install one
   of the following psycopg2 prerequisites:

     * psycopg2, which has some prerequisites of its own. This package is
       recommended for production environments.

     * psycopg2-binary. This package is recommended for development and
       testing.

   After you install the psycopg2 prerequisite, you can install the
   CockroachDB Django backend:

   copy

 $ python -m pip install django-cockroachdb==3.0.*

   Note:

   The major version of django-cockroachdb must correspond to the major
   version of django. The minor release numbers do not need to match.

   For a simple but complete "Hello World" example app, see Build a Python
   App with CockroachDB and Django.

       cockroachdb-test-app command puts you into the newly created app
       directory.
