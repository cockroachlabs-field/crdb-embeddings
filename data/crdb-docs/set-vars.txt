                             SET (session variable)

   The SET statement can modify one of the session configuration variables.
   These can also be queried via SHOW.

   Warning:
   In some cases, client drivers can drop and restart the connection to the
   server. When this happens, any session configurations made with SET
   statements are lost. It is therefore more reliable to configure the
   session in the client's connection string. For examples in different
   languages, see the Build an App with CockroachDB tutorials.

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to modify the session settings.

Synopsis

   SET SESSION var_name TO = var_value ,
   Note:
   The SET statement for session settings is unrelated to the other SET
   TRANSACTION and SET CLUSTER SETTING statements.

Parameters

   The SET <session variable> statement accepts two parameters: the variable
   name and the value to use to modify the variable.

   The variable name is case insensitive. The value can be a list of one or
   more items. For example, the variable search_path is multi-valued.

  Supported variables

Examples

  Set simple variables

   The following demonstrates how SET can be used to configure the default
   database for the current session:

   copy

 > SET database = movr;

   copy

 > SHOW database;

   database
 +----------+
   movr
 (1 row)

  Set variables to values containing spaces

   The following demonstrates how to use quoting to use values containing
   spaces:

   copy

 > SET database = "database name with spaces";

   copy

 > SHOW database;

   database
 +----------+
   database name with spaces
 (1 row)

  Set variables to a list of values

   The following demonstrates how to assign a list of values:

   copy

 > SET search_path = pg_catalog,public;

   copy

 > SHOW search_path;

      search_path
 +--------------------+
   pg_catalog, public
 (1 row)

  Reset a variable to its default value

   Tip:
   You can use RESET to reset a session variable as well.
   copy

 > SHOW search_path;

   search_path
 +-------------+
   public
 (1 row)

   copy

 > SET search_path = 'app';

   copy

 > SHOW search_path;

   search_path
 +-------------+
   app
 (1 row)

   copy

 > SET search_path = DEFAULT;

   copy

 > SHOW search_path;

   search_path
 +-------------+
   public
 (1 row)

SET TIME ZONE

   Warning:

   As a best practice, we recommend not using this setting and avoid setting
   a session time for your database. We instead recommend converting UTC
   values to the appropriate time zone on the client side.

   You can control the default time zone for a session with SET TIME ZONE.
   This will apply an offset to all TIMESTAMPTZ/TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE and
   TIMETZ/TIME WITH TIME ZONE values in the session. By default, CockroachDB
   uses UTC as the time zone for SET TIME ZONE offsets.

  Parameters

   The input passed to SET TIME ZONE indicates the time zone for the current
   session. This value can be a string representation of a local
   system-defined time zone (e.g., 'EST', 'America/New_York') or a positive
   or negative numeric offset from UTC (e.g., -7, +7, or UTC-7, UTC+7) or GMT
   (e.g., GMT-7, GMT+7). The numeric offset input can also be colon-delimited
   (e.g., -7:00, GMT+7:00).

   Note:

   Only offsets specified by integers use the ISO 8601 time offset (i.e., the
   offset input is parsed as hours east of the specified time zone). If you
   explicitly specify UTC or GMT for the time zone offset (e.g.,
   UTC-7,GMT+7), or if the numeric input is colon-delimited (e.g., -7:00,
   GMT+7:00), CockroachDB uses the POSIX time offset (i.e., hours west of the
   specified time zone).

   All timezone abbreviations are case-sensitive and must be uppercase, with
   the exception of UTC, for which utc is an alias.

   DEFAULT, LOCAL, or 0 sets the session time zone to UTC.

  Example: Set the default time zone via SET TIME ZONE

   copy

 > SET TIME ZONE 'EST'; -- same as SET "timezone" = 'EST'

   copy

 > SHOW TIME ZONE;

   timezone
 +----------+
   EST
 (1 row)

   copy

 > SET TIME ZONE DEFAULT; -- same as SET "timezone" = DEFAULT

   copy

 > SHOW TIME ZONE;

   timezone
 +----------+
   UTC
 (1 row)

SET TRACING

   SET TRACING changes the trace recording state of the current session. A
   trace recording can be inspected with the SHOW TRACE FOR SESSION
   statement.

   Value   Description                                                        
   off     Trace recording is disabled.                                       
   cluster Trace recording is enabled; distributed traces are collected.      
   on      Same as cluster.                                                   
   kv      Same as cluster except that "kv messages" are collected instead of 
           regular trace messages. See SHOW TRACE FOR SESSION.                
   local   Trace recording is enabled; only trace messages issued by the      
           local node are collected.                                          
           Result rows and row counts are copied to the session trace. This   
           must be specified to in order for the output of a query to be      
   results printed in the session trace.                                      
                                                                              
           Example: SET tracing = kv, results;
