   The SHOW DATABASES statement lists all databases in the CockroachDB
   cluster.

Synopsis

   SHOW DATABASES WITH COMMENT

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to list the databases in the CockroachDB
   cluster.

Example

  Show databases

   copy

 > SHOW DATABASES;

   database_name
 +---------------+
   defaultdb
   movr
   postgres
   startrek
   system
 (5 rows)

   Alternatively, within the built-in SQL shell, you can use the \l shell
   command to list all databases:

   copy

 > \l

   database_name
 +---------------+
   defaultdb
   movr
   postgres
   startrek
   system
 (5 rows)

  Show databases with comments

   You can use COMMENT ON to add comments on a database.

   copy

 > COMMENT ON DATABASE movr IS 'This database holds information about users, vehicles, and rides.';

   To view a database's comments:

   copy

 > SHOW DATABASES WITH COMMENT;

   database_name |                              comment
 +---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   defaultdb     | NULL
   movr          | This database holds information about users, vehicles, and rides.
   postgres      | NULL
   startrek      | NULL
   system        | NULL
 (5 rows)

   For more information, see COMMENT ON.

Preloaded databases

   New clusters and existing clusters upgraded to v2.1 or later will include
   three auto-generated databases, with the following purposes:

     * The empty defaultdb database is used if a client does not specify a
       database in the connection parameters.

     * The movr database contains data about users, vehicles, and rides for
       the vehicle-sharing app MovR.

     * An empty database called postgres is provided for compatibility with
       Postgres client applications that require it.

     * The startrek database contains quotes from episodes.

     * The system database contains CockroachDB metadata and is read-only.

   The postgres and defaultdb databases can be deleted if they are not
   needed.
