   The ALTER SEQUENCE statement changes the name, increment values, and other
   settings of a sequence.

   Note:

   This statement performs a schema change. For more information about how
   online schema changes work in CockroachDB, see Online Schema Changes.

Required privileges

   The user must have the CREATE privilege on the parent database.

Synopsis

   ALTER SEQUENCE IF EXISTS sequence_name NO CYCLE MINVALUE MAXVALUE OWNED BY
   NONE column_name INCREMENT BY MINVALUE MAXVALUE START WITH integer VIRTUAL

Parameters

   Parameter            Description                                           
   IF EXISTS            Modify the sequence only if it exists; if it does not 
                        exist, do not return an error.                        
   sequence_name        The name of the sequence you want to modify.          
                        The new value by which the sequence is incremented. A 
   INCREMENT            negative number creates a descending sequence. A      
                        positive number creates an ascending sequence.        
                        The new minimum value of the sequence.                
   MINVALUE                                                                   
                        Default: 1                                            
                        The new maximum value of the sequence.                
   MAXVALUE                                                                   
                        Default: 9223372036854775807                          
                        The value the sequence starts at if you RESTART or if 
   START                the sequence hits the MAXVALUE and CYCLE is set.      
                                                                              
                        RESTART and CYCLE are not implemented yet.            
                        The sequence will wrap around when the sequence value 
   CYCLE                hits the maximum or minimum value. If NO CYCLE is     
                        set, the sequence will not wrap.                      
                        Associates the sequence to a particular column. If    
                        that column or its parent table is dropped, the       
                        sequence will also be dropped.                        
                                                                              
   OWNED BY column_name Specifying an owner column with OWNED BY replaces any 
                        existing owner column on the sequence. To remove      
                        existing column ownership on the sequence and make    
                        the column free-standing, specify OWNED BY NONE.      
                                                                              
                        Default: NONE                                         

Examples

  Change the increment value of a sequence

   In this example, we're going to change the increment value of a sequence
   from its current state (i.e., 1) to 2.

   copy

 > ALTER SEQUENCE customer_seq INCREMENT 2;

   Next, we'll add another record to the table and check that the new record
   adheres to the new sequence.

   copy

 > INSERT INTO customer_list (customer, address) VALUES ('Marie', '333 Ocean Ave');

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM customer_list;

 +----+----------+--------------------+
 | id | customer |      address       |
 +----+----------+--------------------+
 |  1 | Lauren   | 123 Main Street    |
 |  2 | Jesse    | 456 Broad Ave      |
 |  3 | Amruta   | 9876 Green Parkway |
 |  5 | Marie    | 333 Ocean Ave      |
 +----+----------+--------------------+

  Set the next value of a sequence

   In this example, we're going to change the next value of the example
   sequence (customer_seq). Currently, the next value will be 7 (i.e., 5 +
   INCREMENT 2). We will change the next value to 20.

   Note:
   You cannot set a value outside the MAXVALUE or MINVALUE of the sequence.
   copy

 > SELECT setval('customer_seq', 20, false);

 +--------+
 | setval |
 +--------+
 |     20 |
 +--------+

   Note:

   The setval('seq_name', value, is_called) function in CockroachDB SQL
   mimics the setval() function in PostgreSQL, but it does not store the
   is_called flag. Instead, it sets the value to val - increment for false or
   val for true.

   Let's add another record to the table to check that the new record adheres
   to the new next value.

   copy

 > INSERT INTO customer_list (customer, address) VALUES ('Lola', '333 Schermerhorn');

 +----+----------+--------------------+
 | id | customer |      address       |
 +----+----------+--------------------+
 |  1 | Lauren   | 123 Main Street    |
 |  2 | Jesse    | 456 Broad Ave      |
 |  3 | Amruta   | 9876 Green Parkway |
 |  5 | Marie    | 333 Ocean Ave      |
 | 20 | Lola     | 333 Schermerhorn   |
 +----+----------+--------------------+
