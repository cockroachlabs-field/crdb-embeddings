   The cockroach debug ballast command creates a large, unused file that you
   can place in a node's storage directory. In the case that a node runs out
   of disk space and shuts down, you can delete the ballast file to free up
   enough space to be able to restart the node.

     * In addition to placing a ballast file in each node's storage
       directory, it is important to actively monitor remaining disk space.
     * Ballast files may be created in many ways, including the standard dd
       command. cockroach debug ballast uses the fallocate system call when
       available, so it will be faster than dd.

Subcommands

   While the cockroach debug command has a few subcommands, users are
   expected to use only the zip, encryption-active-key, merge-logs, and
   ballast subcommands.

   The other debug subcommands are useful only to CockroachDB's developers
   and contributors.

Synopsis

   Create a ballast file:

 $ cockroach debug ballast [path to ballast file] [flags]

Flags

   Flag   Description                                                         
          The amount of space to fill, or to leave available, in a node's     
          storage directory via a ballast file. Positive values equal the     
          size of the ballast file. Negative values equal the amount of space 
          to leave after creating the ballast file. This can be a percentage  
          (notated as a decimal or with %) or any bytes-based unit, for       
          example:                                                            
   --size                                                                     
   -z     --size=1000000000 ----> 1000000000 bytes                            
          --size=1GiB ----> 1073741824 bytes                                  
          --size=5% ----> 5% of available space                               
          --size=0.05 ----> 5% of available space                             
          --size=.05 ----> 5% of available space                              
                                                                              
          Default: 1GB                                                        

Examples

  Create a 1GB ballast file (default)

   copy

 $ cockroach debug ballast cockroach-data/ballast.txt

  Create a ballast file of a different size

   copy

 $ cockroach debug ballast cockroach-data/ballast.txt --size=2GB
