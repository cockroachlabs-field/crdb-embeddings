                                    ROLLBACK

   The ROLLBACK statement aborts the current transaction and all of its
   nested transactions, discarding all transactional updates made by
   statements included in the transaction.

   There are two ways to use ROLLBACK:

     * The ROLLBACK statement rolls back the entire transaction.

     * The ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement rolls back and restarts the nested
       transaction started at the corresponding SAVEPOINT statement, for
       working with standard savepoints. This is in addition to the existing
       support for working with client-side transaction retries. For examples
       of each usage, see:

          * Rollback a nested transaction
          * Retry a transaction
   Warning:

   Rollbacks to savepoints over DDL statements are only supported if you're
   rolling back to a savepoint created at the beginning of the transaction.

Synopsis

   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to rollback a transaction. However, privileges
   are required for each statement within a transaction.

Parameters

   Parameter                      Description                                 
                                  If using advanced client-side transaction   
   TO SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart retries, retry the transaction. You should  
                                  execute this statement when a transaction   
                                  returns a 40001 / retry transaction error.  
                                  If using nested transactions, roll back and 
   TO SAVEPOINT <name>            restart the nested transaction started at   
                                  the corresponding SAVEPOINT statement.      

Savepoints and row locks

   CockroachDB supports exclusive row locks.

     * In PostgreSQL, row locks are released/cancelled upon ROLLBACK TO
       SAVEPOINT.
     * In CockroachDB, row locks are preserved upon ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT.

   This is an architectural difference in v20.2 that may or may not be lifted
   in a later CockroachDB version.

   The code of client applications that rely on row locks must be reviewed
   and possibly modified to account for this difference. In particular, if an
   application is relying on ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT to release row locks and
   allow a concurrent transaction touching the same rows to proceed, this
   behavior will not work with CockroachDB.

Savepoints and high priority transactions

   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT (for either regular savepoints or "restart
   savepoints" defined with cockroach_restart) causes a "feature not
   supported" error after a DDL statement in a HIGH PRIORITY transaction, in
   order to avoid a transaction deadlock. For more information, see GitHub
   issue #46414.

Examples

  Rollback a transaction

   Typically, an application conditionally executes rollbacks, but we can see
   their behavior by using ROLLBACK instead of COMMIT directly through SQL:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM accounts;

 +----------+---------+
 |   name   | balance |
 +----------+---------+
 | Marciela |    1000 |
 +----------+---------+

   copy

 > BEGIN;

   copy

 > UPDATE accounts SET balance = 2500 WHERE name = 'Marciela';

   copy

 > ROLLBACK;

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM accounts;

 +----------+---------+
 |   name   | balance |
 +----------+---------+
 | Marciela |    1000 |
 +----------+---------+

  Rollback a nested transaction

   The ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement rolls back and restarts the nested
   transaction started at the corresponding SAVEPOINT statement.

   For examples showing how to use ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT to rollback a nested
   transaction, see the SAVEPOINT documentation on nested savepoints.

  Retry a transaction

   When using advanced client-side transaction retries, use ROLLBACK TO
   SAVEPOINT to handle a transaction that needs to be retried (identified via
   the 40001 error code or restart transaction string in the error message),
   and then re-execute the statements you want the transaction to contain.

   copy

 > ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;

   For examples of retrying transactions in an application, check out the
   transaction code samples in our Build an App with CockroachDB tutorials.
