   The Runtime dashboard in the CockroachDB Admin UI lets you monitor runtime
   metrics for you cluster, such as node count, memory usage, and CPU time.
   To view this dashboard, access the Admin UI, click Metrics on the
   left-hand navigation bar, and then select Dashboard > Runtime.

Dashboard navigation

   Use the Graph menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a
   specific node.

   To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a range selector allows you
   to filter the view for a predefined timeframe or custom date/time range.
   Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current
   timeframe. Note that the active timeframe is reflected in the URL and can
   be easily shared.

   The Runtime dashboard displays the following time series graphs:

Live Node Count

   CockroachDB Admin UI Node Count

   In the node view as well as the cluster view, the graph shows the number
   of live nodes in the cluster.

   A dip in the graph indicates decommissioned nodes, dead nodes, or nodes
   that are not responding. To troubleshoot the dip in the graph, refer to
   the Summary panel.

Memory Usage

   CockroachDB Admin UI Memory Usage

     * In the node view, the graph shows the memory in use for the selected
       node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the memory in use across all
       nodes in the cluster.

   On hovering over the graph, the values for the following metrics are
   displayed:

   Metric        Description                           
   RSS           Total memory in use by CockroachDB.   
   Go Allocated  Memory allocated by the Go layer.     
   Go Total      Total memory managed by the Go layer. 
   CGo Allocated Memory allocated by the C layer.      
   CGo Total     Total memory managed by the C layer.  

   Note:
   If Go Total or CGO Total fluctuates or grows steadily over time, contact
   us.

CPU Time

   CockroachDB Admin UI CPU Time

     * In the node view, the graph shows the CPU time used by CockroachDB
       user and system-level operations for the selected node.
     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the CPU time used by CockroachDB
       user and system-level operations across all nodes in the cluster.

   On hovering over the CPU Time graph, the values for the following metrics
   are displayed:

   Metric        Description                                                  
   User CPU Time Total CPU seconds per second used by the CockroachDB process 
                 across all nodes.                                            
   Sys CPU Time  Total CPU seconds per second used for CockroachDB            
                 system-level operations across all nodes.                    

Clock Offset

   CockroachDB Admin UI Clock Offset

     * In the node view, the graph shows the mean clock offset of the node
       against the rest of the cluster.
     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the mean clock offset of each
       node against the rest of the cluster.

Other graphs

   The Runtime dashboard shows other time series graphs that are important
   for CockroachDB developers:

     * Goroutine Count
     * GC Runs
     * GC Pause Time

   For monitoring CockroachDB, it is sufficient to use the Live Node Count,
   Memory Usage, CPU Time, and Clock Offset graphs.

Summary and events

  Summary panel

   A Summary panel of key metrics is displayed to the right of the timeseries
   graphs.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Summary Panel

   Metric             Description                                             
   Total Nodes        The total number of nodes in the cluster.               
                      Decommissioned nodes are not included in this count.    
   Capacity Used      The storage capacity used as a percentage of usable     
                      capacity allocated across all nodes.                    
   Unavailable Ranges The number of unavailable ranges in the cluster. A      
                      non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.          
   Queries per second The total number of SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  
                      queries executed per second across the cluster.         
   P99 Latency        The 99th percentile of service latency.                 

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

  Events panel

   Underneath the Summary panel, the Events panel lists the 5 most recent
   events logged for all nodes across the cluster. To list all events, click
   View all events.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Events

   The following types of events are listed:

     * Database created
     * Database dropped
     * Table created
     * Table dropped
     * Table altered
     * Index created
     * Index dropped
     * View created
     * View dropped
     * Schema change reversed
     * Schema change finished
     * Node joined
     * Node decommissioned
     * Node restarted
     * Cluster setting changed
