   The DROP DATABASE statement removes a database and all its objects from a
   CockroachDB cluster.

   Note:

   This statement performs a schema change. For more information about how
   online schema changes work in CockroachDB, see Online Schema Changes.

Required privileges

   The user must have the DROP privilege on the database and on all tables in
   the database.

Synopsis

   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS name CASCADE RESTRICT

Parameters

   Parameter Description                                                      
   IF EXISTS Drop the database if it exists; if it does not exist, do not     
             return an error.                                                 
             The name of the database you want to drop. You cannot drop a     
   name      database if it is set as the current database or if              
             sql_safe_updates = true.                                         
             (Default) Drop all tables and views in the database as well as   
             all objects (such as constraints and views) that depend on those 
   CASCADE   tables.                                                          
                                                                              
             CASCADE does not list objects it drops, so should be used        
             cautiously.                                                      
   RESTRICT  Do not drop the database if it contains any tables or views.     

Viewing schema changes

   This schema change statement is registered as a job. You can view
   long-running jobs with SHOW JOBS.

Examples

  Drop a database and its objects (CASCADE)

   For non-interactive sessions (e.g., client applications), DROP DATABASE
   applies the CASCADE option by default, which drops all tables and views in
   the database as well as all objects (such as constraints and views) that
   depend on those tables.

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM db2;

 +------------+
 | table_name |
 +------------+
 | t1         |
 | v1         |
 +------------+
 (2 rows)

   copy

 > DROP DATABASE db2;

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM db2;

 pq: database "db2" does not exist

   For interactive sessions from the built-in SQL client, either the CASCADE
   option must be set explicitly or the --unsafe-updates flag must be set
   when starting the shell.

  Prevent dropping a non-empty database (RESTRICT)

   When a database is not empty, the RESTRICT option prevents the database
   from being dropped:

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM db2;

 +------------+
 | table_name |
 +------------+
 | t1         |
 | v1         |
 +------------+
 (2 rows)

   copy

 > DROP DATABASE db2 RESTRICT;

 pq: database "db2" is not empty and CASCADE was not specified
