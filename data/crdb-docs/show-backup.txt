Response

   The following fields are returned.

   Field            Description                                               
   database_name    The database name.                                        
   table_name       The table name.                                           
   start_time       The time at which the backup was started. For a full      
                    backup, this will be empty.                               
   end_time         The time at which the backup was completed.               
   size_bytes       The size of the backup, in bytes.                         
                    The CREATE statement used to create table(s), view(s), or 
                    sequence(s) that are stored within the backup. This       
   create_statement displays when SHOW BACKUP SCHEMAS is used. Note that      
                    tables with references to foreign keys will only display  
                    foreign key constraints if the table to which the         
                    constraint relates to is also included in the backup.     
   is_full_cluster  Whether the backup is of a full cluster or not.
