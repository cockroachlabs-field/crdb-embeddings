   The Jobs page of the Admin UI provides details about long-running tasks
   performed by your cluster. These can include:

     * Schema changes through ALTER TABLE, DROP DATABASE, DROP TABLE, and
       TRUNCATE.
     * IMPORT.
     * Enterprise BACKUP and RESTORE.
     * User-created table statistics created for use by the cost-based
       optimizer.
     * Automatic table statistics.
     * Changefeeds.
   Tip:

   All users can see their own jobs, and admin users can view all jobs
   performed across all nodes in the cluster.

   To view these details, access the Admin UI and click Jobs in the left-hand
   navigation.

Filter jobs

   Use the Status menu to filter jobs by job status.

   Use the Type menu to filter jobs by type.

   You can toggle between showing the latest 50 jobs or all jobs on the
   cluster.

   Note:

   Jobs are deleted every 14 days. This interval can be changed via the
   jobs.retention_time cluster setting.

   The Jobs list is designed for you to manage pending work. It is not
   intended to display the canonical record of all jobs that have run. If you
   need a historical record of all jobs you have run, you should log this
   information externally.

Jobs list

   Use the Jobs list to see your recently created and completed jobs.

     * For changefeeds, the table displays a high-water timestamp that
       advances as the changefeed progresses. This is a guarantee that all
       changes before or at the timestamp have been emitted. Hover over the
       high-water timestamp to view the system time.

     * Automatic table statistics jobs are not displayed even when the Type
       menu is set to All. To view these jobs, set Type to
       Automatic-Statistics Creation as described above.

     * To view job details, click on the job description.
