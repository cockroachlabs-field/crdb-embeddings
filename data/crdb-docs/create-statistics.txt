                               CREATE STATISTICS

   Use the CREATE STATISTICS statement to generate table statistics for the
   cost-based optimizer to use.

   Once you create a table and load data into it (e.g., INSERT, IMPORT),
   table statistics can be generated. Table statistics help the cost-based
   optimizer determine the cardinality of the rows used in each query, which
   helps to predict more accurate costs.

   CREATE STATISTICS automatically figures out which columns to get
   statistics on — specifically, it chooses:

     * Columns that are part of the primary key or an index (in other words,
       all indexed columns).
     * Up to 100 non-indexed columns (unless you specify which columns to
       create statistics on, as shown in this example).
   Note:

   Automatic statistics is enabled by default; most users don't need to issue
   CREATE STATISTICS statements directly.

Synopsis

   CREATE STATISTICS statistics_name opt_stats_columns FROM
   create_stats_target opt_as_of_clause

Required Privileges

   The user must have the CREATE privilege on the parent database.

Parameters

   Parameter           Description                                            
   statistics_name     The name of the set of statistics you are creating.    
   opt_stats_columns   The name of the column(s) you want to create           
                       statistics for.                                        
   create_stats_target The name of the table you want to create statistics    
                       for.                                                   
                       Used to create historical stats using the AS OF SYSTEM 
   opt_as_of_clause    TIME clause. For instructions, see Create statistics   
                       as of a given time.                                    

Examples

  Create statistics on a specific column

   copy

 > CREATE STATISTICS students ON id FROM students_by_list;

   Note:

   Multi-column statistics are not supported yet.

  Create statistics on a default set of columns

   The CREATE STATISTICS statement shown below automatically figures out
   which columns to get statistics on — specifically, it chooses:

     * Columns that are part of the primary key or an index (in other words,
       all indexed columns).
     * Up to 100 non-indexed columns.
   copy

 > CREATE STATISTICS students FROM students_by_list;

  Create statistics as of a given time

   To create statistics as of a given time (in this example, 1 minute ago to
   avoid interfering with the production workload), run a statement like the
   following:

   copy

 > CREATE STATISTICS employee_stats FROM employees AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-1m';

   For more information about how the AS OF SYSTEM TIME clause works,
   including supported time formats, see AS OF SYSTEM TIME.

  Delete statistics

   To delete statistics for all tables in all databases:

   copy

 > DELETE FROM system.table_statistics WHERE true;

   To delete a named set of statistics (e.g, one named "my_stats"), run a
   query like the following:

   copy

 > DELETE FROM system.table_statistics WHERE name = 'my_stats';

   After deleting statistics, restart the nodes in your cluster to clear the
   statistics caches.

   For more information about the DELETE statement, see DELETE.

  View statistics jobs

   Every time the CREATE STATISTICS statement is executed, it kicks off a
   background job. This is true for queries issued by your application as
   well as queries issued by the automatic stats feature.

   To view statistics jobs, there are two options:

    1. Use SHOW JOBS to see all statistics jobs that were created by user
       queries (i.e., someone entering CREATE STATISTICS at the SQL prompt or
       via application code):

       copy

 > SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE job_type LIKE '%CREATE STATS%';

        job_id       |   job_type   |                           description                            | statement | user_name |  status   | running_status |          created           |          started           |          finished          |          modified          | fraction_completed | error | coordinator_id

    2. Use SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS to see statistics jobs that were created by
       the automatic statistics feature:

       copy

 > SELECT * FROM [SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS] WHERE job_type LIKE '%CREATE STATS%';

        job_id       |     job_type      |                        description                         |                                         statement                                         | user_name |  status   | running_status |          created           |          started           |          finished          |          modified          | fraction_completed | error | coordinator_id
