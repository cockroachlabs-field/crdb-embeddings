   The SHOW ROLES statement lists the roles for all databases.

   Note:

   Since the keywords ROLES and USERS can now be used interchangeably in SQL
   statements for enhanced Postgres compatibility, SHOW ROLES is now an alias
   for SHOW USERS.

Synopsis

   SHOW ROLES

Required privileges

   The role must have the SELECT privilege on the system.users and
   system.role_members tables.

Example

   copy

 > SHOW ROLES;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | NOLOGIN    | {}
   petee    |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (4 rows)
