                                   ALTER ROLE

   The ALTER ROLE statement can be used to add, change, or remove a role's
   password and to change the login privileges for a role.

   Note:

   Since the keywords ROLE and USER can now be used interchangeably in SQL
   statements for enhanced Postgres compatibility, ALTER ROLE is now an alias
   for ALTER USER.

Considerations

     * Password creation and alteration is supported only in secure clusters.

Required privileges

   To alter other roles, the role must have the CREATEROLE parameter set.

Synopsis

   ALTER ROLE USER IF EXISTS name opt_with role_options

Parameters

   Parameter               Description                                        
   name                    The name of the role whose password you want to    
                           create or add.                                     
                           Let the role authenticate their access to a secure 
                           cluster using this new password. Passwords should  
                           be entered as a string literal. For compatibility  
                           with PostgreSQL, a password can also be entered as 
   password                an identifier.                                     
                                                                              
                           To prevent a role from using password              
                           authentication and to mandate certificate-based    
                           client authentication, set the password as NULL.   
   VALID UNTIL             The date and time (in the timestamp format) after  
                           which the password is not valid.                   
                           The LOGIN parameter allows a role to login with    
   LOGIN/NOLOGIN           one of the client authentication methods. Setting  
                           the parameter to NOLOGIN prevents the role from    
                           logging in using any authentication method.        
                           Allow or disallow the role to create, alter, and   
                           drop other roles.                                  
   CREATEROLE/NOCREATEROLE                                                    
                           By default, the parameter is set to NOCREATEROLE   
                           for all non-admin and non-root roles.              

Examples

  Change password using a string literal

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD 'ilov3beefjerky';

 ALTER ROLE 1

  Change password using an identifier

   The following statement changes the password to ilov3beefjerky, as above:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD ilov3beefjerky;

   This is equivalent to the example in the previous section because the
   password contains only lowercase characters.

   In contrast, the following statement changes the password to
   thereisnotomorrow, even though the password in the syntax contains
   capitals, because identifiers are normalized automatically:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD ThereIsNoTomorrow;

   To preserve case in a password specified using identifier syntax, use
   double quotes:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD "ThereIsNoTomorrow";

  Set password validity

   The following statement sets the date and time after which the password is
   not valid:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl VALID UNTIL '2021-01-01';

  Prevent a role from using password authentication

   The following statement prevents the role from using password
   authentication and mandates certificate-based client authentication:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD NULL;

  Change login privileges for a role

   The following statement prevents the role from logging in with any client
   authentication method:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl NOLOGIN;

   copy

 > SHOW ROLES;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | NOLOGIN    | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)

   The following statement allows the role to log in with one of the client
   authentication methods:

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl LOGIN;

   copy

 > SHOW ROLES;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)

  Allow the role to create other roles

   copy

 > SHOW ROLES;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)

   copy

 > ALTER ROLE carl with CREATEROLE;

   copy

 > SHOW ROLES;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | CREATEROLE | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)
