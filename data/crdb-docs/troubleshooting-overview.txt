   If you run into issues with CockroachDB, there are a few initial steps you
   can always take:

    1. Check your logs for errors related to your issue.

          * Logs are generated on a per-node basis, so you must either
            identify the node where the issue occurred or collect the logs
            from all active nodes in your cluster.
          * Alternately, you can stop and restart problematic nodes with the
            --logtostderr flag to print logs to your terminal through stderr,
            letting you see all cluster activities as it occurs.
    2. Check our list of common errors for a solution. If you are getting
       transaction retry errors, see client-side retry handling and the
       Transaction Retry Error Reference.

    3. If the problem doesn't match a common error, try the following pages:

          * Troubleshoot Cluster Setup helps start your cluster and scale it
            by adding nodes.
          * Troubleshoot Query Behavior helps with unexpected query results.
    4. If you cannot resolve the issue easily yourself, the following tools
       can help you get unstuck:

          * Support Resources identifies ways you can get help with
            troubleshooting.
          * File an Issue provides details about filing issues that you're
            unable to resolve.
