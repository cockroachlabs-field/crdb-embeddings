                                    TRUNCATE

   The TRUNCATE statement removes all rows from a table. At a high level, it
   works by dropping the table and recreating a new table with the same name.

   Note:

   For smaller tables (with less than 1000 rows), using a DELETE statement
   without a WHERE clause will be more performant than using TRUNCATE.

   Note:

   This statement performs a schema change. For more information about how
   online schema changes work in CockroachDB, see Online Schema Changes.

Synopsis

   TRUNCATE TABLE table_name , CASCADE RESTRICT

Required privileges

   The user must have the DROP privilege on the table.

Parameters

   Parameter  Description                                                     
   table_name The name of the table to truncate.                              
              Truncate all tables with Foreign Key dependencies on the table  
              being truncated.                                                
   CASCADE                                                                    
              CASCADE does not list dependent tables it truncates, so should  
              be used cautiously.                                             
   RESTRICT   (Default) Do not truncate the table if any other tables have    
              Foreign Key dependencies on it.                                 

Limitations

   TRUNCATE is a schema change, and as such is not transactional. For more
   information about how schema changes work, see Online Schema Changes.

Viewing schema changes

   This schema change statement is registered as a job. You can view
   long-running jobs with SHOW JOBS.

Examples

  Truncate a table (no foreign key dependencies)

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM t1;

 +----+------+
 | id | name |
 +----+------+
 |  1 | foo  |
 |  2 | bar  |
 +----+------+
 (2 rows)

   copy

 > TRUNCATE t1;

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM t1;

 +----+------+
 | id | name |
 +----+------+
 +----+------+
 (0 rows)

  Truncate a table and dependent tables

   In these examples, the orders table has a Foreign Key relationship to the
   customers table. Therefore, it's only possible to truncate the customers
   table while simultaneously truncating the dependent orders table, either
   using CASCADE or explicitly.

    Truncate dependent tables using CASCADE

   Warning:
   CASCADE truncates all dependent tables without listing them, which can
   lead to inadvertent and difficult-to-recover losses. To avoid potential
   harm, we recommend truncating tables explicitly in most cases. See
   Truncate Dependent Tables Explicitly for more details.
   copy

 > TRUNCATE customers;

 pq: "customers" is referenced by foreign key from table "orders"

   copy

 > TRUNCATE customers CASCADE;

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM customers;

 +----+-------+
 | id | email |
 +----+-------+
 +----+-------+
 (0 rows)

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM orders;

 +----+----------+------------+
 | id | customer | orderTotal |
 +----+----------+------------+
 +----+----------+------------+
 (0 rows)

    Truncate dependent tables explicitly

   copy

 > TRUNCATE customers, orders;

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM customers;

 +----+-------+
 | id | email |
 +----+-------+
 +----+-------+
 (0 rows)

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM orders;

 +----+----------+------------+
 | id | customer | orderTotal |
 +----+----------+------------+
 +----+----------+------------+
 (0 rows)
