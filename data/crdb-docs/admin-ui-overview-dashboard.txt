   The Overview dashboard lets you monitor important SQL performance,
   replication, and storage metrics. To view this dashboard, access the Admin
   UI and click Metrics on the left-hand navigation bar. The Overview
   dashboard is displayed by default.

Dashboard navigation

   Use the Graph menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a
   specific node.

   To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a range selector allows you
   to filter the view for a predefined timeframe or custom date/time range.
   Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current
   timeframe. Note that the active timeframe is reflected in the URL and can
   be easily shared.

   The Overview dashboard displays the following time series graphs:

SQL Queries

   CockroachDB Admin UI SQL Queries graph

     * In the node view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number
       of SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries per second issued by SQL
       clients on the node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the sum of the per-node averages,
       that is, an aggregate estimation of the current query load over the
       cluster, assuming the last 10 seconds of activity per node are
       representative of this load.

Service Latency: SQL, 99th percentile

   CockroachDB Admin UI Service Latency graph

   Service latency is calculated as the time between when the cluster
   receives a query and finishes executing the query. This time does not
   include returning results to the client.

     * In the node view, the graph shows the 99th percentile of service
       latency for the node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the 99th percentile of service
       latency across all nodes in the cluster.

Replicas per Node

   CockroachDB Admin UI Replicas per node graph

   Ranges are subsets of your data, which are replicated to ensure
   survivability. Ranges are replicated to a configurable number of
   CockroachDB nodes.

     * In the node view, the graph shows the number of range replicas on the
       selected node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the number of range replicas on
       each node in the cluster.

   For details about how to control the number and location of replicas, see
   Configure Replication Zones.

   Note:

   The timeseries data used to power the graphs in the Admin UI is stored
   within the cluster and accumulates for 30 days before it starts getting
   truncated. As a result, for the first 30 days or so of a cluster's life,
   you will see a steady increase in disk usage and the number of ranges even
   if you aren't writing data to the cluster yourself. For more details, see
   this FAQ.

Capacity

   CockroachDB Admin UI Capacity graph

   You can monitor the Capacity graph to determine when additional storage is
   needed (e.g., by scaling your cluster).

   Metric    Description                                                      
             The maximum store size. This value may be set per node using     
   Capacity  --store. If a store size has not been set, this metric displays  
             the actual disk capacity. See Capacity metrics.                  
   Available The free disk space available to CockroachDB data.               
   Used      The disk space in use by CockroachDB data. This excludes the     
             Cockroach binary, operating system, and other system files.      

  Capacity metrics

   The Capacity graph displays disk usage by CockroachDB data in relation to
   the maximum store size, which is determined as follows:

     * If a store size was specified using the --store flag when starting
       nodes, this value is used as the limit for CockroachDB data.
     * If no store size has been explicitly set, the actual disk capacity is
       used as the limit for CockroachDB data.

   The available capacity thus equals the amount of empty disk space, up to
   the value of the maximum store size. The used capacity refers only to disk
   space occupied by CockroachDB data, which resides in the store directory
   on each node.

   The disk usage of the Cockroach binary, operating system, and other system
   files is not shown on the Capacity graph.

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

Summary and events

  Summary panel

   A Summary panel of key metrics is displayed to the right of the timeseries
   graphs.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Summary Panel

   Metric             Description                                             
   Total Nodes        The total number of nodes in the cluster.               
                      Decommissioned nodes are not included in this count.    
   Capacity Used      The storage capacity used as a percentage of usable     
                      capacity allocated across all nodes.                    
   Unavailable Ranges The number of unavailable ranges in the cluster. A      
                      non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.          
   Queries per second The total number of SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  
                      queries executed per second across the cluster.         
   P99 Latency        The 99th percentile of service latency.                 

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

  Events panel

   Underneath the Summary panel, the Events panel lists the 5 most recent
   events logged for all nodes across the cluster. To list all events, click
   View all events.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Events

   The following types of events are listed:

     * Database created
     * Database dropped
     * Table created
