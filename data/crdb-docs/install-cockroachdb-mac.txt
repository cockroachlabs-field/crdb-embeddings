   See Release Notes for what's new in the latest release, v20.2.0-alpha.2.
   To upgrade to this release from an older version, see Cluster Upgrade.

Use Homebrew

    1. Install Homebrew.

    2. Instruct Homebrew to install CockroachDB:

       copy

 $ brew install cockroachdb/tap/cockroach

    3. Keep up-to-date with CockroachDB releases and best practices:

   Note:
   If you previously installed CockroachDB via Homebrew before version v19.2,
   run brew uninstall cockroach before installing the new version. If you
   installed using a different method, you may need to remove the binary
   before installing via Homebrew.

Download the binary

    1. Download the CockroachDB archive for OS X, and extract the binary:

       copy

 $ curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.darwin-10.9-amd64.tgz | tar -xJ

    2. Copy the binary into your PATH so you can execute cockroach commands
       from any shell:

       copy

 cp -i cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.darwin-10.9-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/

       If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with sudo.

    3. Keep up-to-date with CockroachDB releases and best practices:

Use Kubernetes

   To orchestrate CockroachDB locally using Kubernetes, either with
   configuration files or the Helm package manager, see Orchestrate
   CockroachDB Locally with Minikube.

Use Docker

   Warning:
   Running a stateful application like CockroachDB in Docker is more complex
   and error-prone than most uses of Docker. Unless you are very experienced
   with Docker, we recommend starting with a different installation and
   deployment method.
    1. Install Docker for Mac. Please carefully check that you meet all
       prerequisites.

    2. Confirm that the Docker daemon is running in the background:

       copy

 $ docker version

       If you do not see the server listed, start the Docker daemon.

    3. Pull the image for the v20.2.0-alpha.2 release of CockroachDB from
       Docker Hub:

       copy

 $ docker pull cockroachdb/cockroach-unstable:v20.2.0-alpha.2

    4. Keep up-to-date with CockroachDB releases and best practices:

Build from source

    1. Install the following prerequisites, as necessary:

       C++ compiler Must support C++ 11. GCC prior to 6.0 does not work due   
                    to this issue. On macOS, Xcode should suffice.            
                    Version 1.13.5+ is required, but 1.14 and above is not    
       Go           recommended. Older versions might work via make build     
                    IGNORE_GOVERS=1.                                          
       Bash         Versions 4+ are preferred, but later releases from the    
                    3.x series are also known to work.                        
       CMake        Versions 3.8+ are known to work.                          
       Autoconf     Version 2.68 or higher is required.                       

       A 64-bit system is strongly recommended. Building or running
       CockroachDB on 32-bit systems has not been tested. You'll also need at
       least 2GB of RAM. If you plan to run our test suite, you'll need
       closer to 4GB of RAM.

    2. Download the CockroachDB v20.2.0-alpha.2 source archive, and extract
       the sources:

       copy

 $ curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.src.tgz | tar -xJ

    3. In the extracted directory, run make build:

       copy

 cd cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2

       copy

 make build

       The build process can take 10+ minutes, so please be patient.

    4. Install the cockroach binary into /usr/local/bin/ so it's easy to
       execute cockroach commands from any directory:

       copy

 make install

       If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with sudo.

       You can also execute the cockroach binary directly from its built
       location, ./src/github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/cockroach, but the
       rest of the documentation assumes you have the binary on your PATH.

    5. Keep up-to-date with CockroachDB releases and best practices:

What's next?

     * If you're just getting started with CockroachDB:
          * Start a cluster locally and talk to it via the built-in SQL
            client
          * Learn more about CockroachDB SQL
          * Build a simple application with CockroachDB using
            Postgres-compatible client drivers and ORMs
          * Explore core CockroachDB features like automatic replication,
            rebalancing, and fault tolerance
     * If you're ready to run CockroachDB in production:
          * Review the Production Checklist
          * Deploy CockroachDB manually or use an orchestration system like
            Kubernetes
   Note:
   By default, each node of a CockroachDB cluster periodically shares
   anonymous usage details with Cockroach Labs. For an explanation of the
   details that get shared and how to opt-out of reporting, see Diagnostics
   Reporting.
