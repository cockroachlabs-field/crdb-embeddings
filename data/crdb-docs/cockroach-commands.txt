   This page introduces the cockroach commands for configuring, starting, and
   managing a CockroachDB cluster, as well as environment variables that can
   be used in place of certain flags.

   You can run cockroach help in your shell to get similar guidance.

Environment variables

   For many common cockroach flags, such as --port and --user, you can set
   environment variables once instead of manually passing the flags each time
   you execute commands.

     * To find out which flags support environment variables, see the
       documentation for each command.
     * To output the current configuration of CockroachDB and other
       environment variables, run env.
     * When a node uses environment variables on startup, the variable names
       are printed to the node's logs; however, the variable values are not.

   CockroachDB prioritizes command flags, environment variables, and defaults
   as follows:

    1. If a flag is set for a command, CockroachDB uses it.
    2. If a flag is not set for a command, CockroachDB uses the corresponding
       environment variable.
    3. If neither the flag nor environment variable is set, CockroachDB uses
       the default for the flag.
    4. If there's no flag default, CockroachDB gives an error.

   For more details, see Client Connection Parameters.
