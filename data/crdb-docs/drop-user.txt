   The DROP USER statement removes one or more SQL users.

   Note:

   Since the keywords ROLE and USER can now be used interchangeably in SQL
   statements for enhanced Postgres compatibility, DROP USER is now an alias
   for DROP ROLE.

Required privileges

   To drop other non-admin users, the user must have the CREATEROLE parameter
   set.

Synopsis

   DROP USER IF EXISTS user_name ,

Parameters

   Parameter Description                                                      
             The username of the user to remove. To remove multiple users,    
   user_name use a comma-separate list of usernames.                          
                                                                              
             You can use SHOW USERS to find usernames.                        

Example

   All of a user's privileges must be revoked before the user can be dropped.

   In this example, first check a user's privileges. Then, revoke the user's
   privileges before removing the user.

   copy

 > SHOW GRANTS ON test.customers FOR mroach;

 +-----------+--------+------------+
 |   Table   |  User  | Privileges |
 +-----------+--------+------------+
 | customers | mroach | CREATE     |
 | customers | mroach | INSERT     |
 | customers | mroach | UPDATE     |
 +-----------+--------+------------+
 (3 rows)

   copy

 > REVOKE CREATE,INSERT,UPDATE ON test.customers FROM mroach;

   copy

 > DROP USER mroach;
