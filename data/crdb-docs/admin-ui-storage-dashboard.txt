   The Storage dashboard lets you monitor the storage utilization of your
   cluster.

   To view this dashboard, access the Admin UI, click Metrics in the
   left-hand navigation, and select Dashboard > Storage.

Dashboard navigation

   Use the Graph menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a
   specific node.

   To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a range selector allows you
   to filter the view for a predefined timeframe or custom date/time range.
   Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current
   timeframe. Note that the active timeframe is reflected in the URL and can
   be easily shared.

   The Storage dashboard displays the following time series graphs:

Capacity

   You can monitor the Capacity graph to determine when additional storage is
   needed (e.g., by scaling your cluster).

   CockroachDB Admin UI Capacity graph

   Metric    Description                                                      
             The maximum store size. This value may be set per node using     
   Capacity  --store. If a store size has not been set, this metric displays  
             the actual disk capacity. See Capacity metrics.                  
   Available The free disk space available to CockroachDB data.               
   Used      The disk space in use by CockroachDB data. This excludes the     
             Cockroach binary, operating system, and other system files.      

  Capacity metrics

   The Capacity graph displays disk usage by CockroachDB data in relation to
   the maximum store size, which is determined as follows:

     * If a store size was specified using the --store flag when starting
       nodes, this value is used as the limit for CockroachDB data.
     * If no store size has been explicitly set, the actual disk capacity is
       used as the limit for CockroachDB data.

   The available capacity thus equals the amount of empty disk space, up to
   the value of the maximum store size. The used capacity refers only to disk
   space occupied by CockroachDB data, which resides in the store directory
   on each node.

   The disk usage of the Cockroach binary, operating system, and other system
   files is not shown on the Capacity graph.

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

Live Bytes

   The Live Bytes graph displays the amount of data that can be read by
   applications and CockroachDB.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Replicas per Store

   Metric Description                                                         
   Live   Number of logical bytes stored in live key-value pairs. Live data   
          excludes historical and deleted data.                               
          Number of physical bytes stored in system key-value pairs. This     
   System includes historical and deleted data that has not been garbage      
          collected.                                                          

   Note:

   Logical bytes reflect the approximate number of bytes stored in the
   database. This value may deviate from the number of physical bytes on
   disk, due to factors such as compression and write amplification.

File Descriptors

   CockroachDB Admin UI File Descriptors

     * In the node view, the graph shows the number of open file descriptors
       for that node, compared with the file descriptor limit.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the number of open file
       descriptors across all nodes, compared with the file descriptor limit.

   If the Open count is almost equal to the Limit count, increase File
   Descriptors.

   Note:

   If you are running multiple nodes on a single machine (not recommended),
   the actual number of open file descriptors are considered open on each
   node. Thus the limit count value displayed on the Admin UI is the actual
   value of open file descriptors multiplied by the number of nodes, compared
   with the file descriptor limit.

   For Windows systems, you can ignore the File Descriptors graph because the
   concept of file descriptors is not applicable to Windows.

Other graphs

   The Storage dashboard shows other time series graphs that are important
   for CockroachDB developers:

     * Log Commit Latency
     * Command Commit Latency
     * Read Amplification
     * SSTables
     * Compactions/Flushes
     * Time Series Writes
     * Time Series Bytes Written

   For monitoring CockroachDB, it is sufficient to use the Capacity and File
   Descriptors graphs.

Summary and events

  Summary panel

   A Summary panel of key metrics is displayed to the right of the timeseries
   graphs.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Summary Panel

   Metric             Description                                             
   Total Nodes        The total number of nodes in the cluster.               
                      Decommissioned nodes are not included in this count.    
   Capacity Used      The storage capacity used as a percentage of usable     
                      capacity allocated across all nodes.                    
   Unavailable Ranges The number of unavailable ranges in the cluster. A      
                      non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.          
   Queries per second The total number of SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  
                      queries executed per second across the cluster.         
   P99 Latency        The 99th percentile of service latency.                 

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

  Events panel

   Underneath the Summary panel, the Events panel lists the 5 most recent
   events logged for all nodes across the cluster. To list all events, click
   View all events.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Events
