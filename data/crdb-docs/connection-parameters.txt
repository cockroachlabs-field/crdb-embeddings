   Client applications, including cockroach client commands, work by
   establishing a network connection to a CockroachDB cluster. The client
   connection parameters determine which CockroachDB cluster they connect to,
   and how to establish this network connection.

Supported connection parameters

   Most client apps, including cockroach client commands, determine which
   CockroachDB server to connect to using a PostgreSQL connection URL. When
   using a URL, a client can also specify additional SQL-level parameters.
   This mode provides the most configuration flexibility.

   In addition, all cockroach client commands also accept discrete connection
   parameters that can specify the connection parameters separately from a
   URL.

When to use a URL and when to use discrete parameters

   Specifying client parameters using a URL may be more convenient during
   experimentation, as it facilitates copy-pasting the connection parameters
   (the URL) between different tools: the output of cockroach start, other
   cockroach commands, GUI database visualizer, programming tools, etc.

   Discrete parameters may be more convenient in automation, where the
   components of the configuration are filled in separately from different
   variables in a script or a service manager.

Connect using a URL

   A connection URL has the following format:

 postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?<parameters>

   cockroach client commands also support UNIX domain socket URIs of the
   following form:

 postgres://<username>:<password>@?host=<directory-path>&port=<port>&<parameters>

   Component        Description                            Required           
   <username>       The SQL user that will own the client  ✗                  
                    session.                               
                    The user's password. It is not                            
                    recommended to pass the password in    
   <password>       the URL directly.                      ✗
                                                           
                    Find more detail about how CockroachDB 
                    handles passwords.                     
   <host>           The host name or address of a          Required by most   
                    CockroachDB node or load balancer.     client drivers.    
                    The port number of the SQL interface

                    CockroachDB is 26257. Use this value   
                    when in doubt.                         
   <database>       A database name to use as current      ✗                  
                    database. Defaults to defaultdb.       
                    The directory path to the client       Required when      
   <directory-path> listening for a socket connection.     specifying a Unix  
                                                           domain socket URI.

                    settings.                              

   Note:

   For cockroach commands that accept a URL, you can specify the URL with the
   command-line flag --url. If --url is not specified but the environment
   variable COCKROACH_URL is defined, the environment variable is used.
   Otherwise, the cockroach command will use discrete connection parameters
   as described below.

   Note:

   The <database> part is not used for cockroach commands other than
   cockroach sql. A warning is currently printed if it is mistakenly
   specified, and future versions of CockroachDB may return an error in that
   case.

  Additional connection parameters

   The following additional parameters can be passed after the ? character in
   the URL:

   Parameter        Description                                 Default value 
                    An initial value for the application_name                 
   application_name session variable.                           Empty string.
                                                                
                    Note: For Java JBDC, use ApplicationName.   
                    Which type of secure connection to use:                   
   sslmode          disable, allow, prefer, require, verify-ca  disable
                    or verify-full. See Secure Connections With 
                    URLs for details.                           
   sslrootcert      Path to the CA certificate, when sslmode is Empty string. 
                    not disable.                                
   sslcert          Path to the client certificate, when        Empty string. 
                    sslmode is not disable.                     
   sslkey           Path to the client private key, when        Empty string. 
                    sslmode is not disable.                     

  Secure connections with URLs

   The following values are supported for sslmode, although only the first
   and the last are recommended for use.

   Parameter           Description                        Recommended for use 
   sslmode=disable     Do not use an encrypted, secure    Use during          
                       connection at all.                 development.        
                       Enable a secure connection only if 
   sslmode=allow       the server requires it.            
                                                          
                       Not supported in all clients.      
                       Try to establish a secure          
                       connection, but accept an insecure 
   sslmode=prefer      connection if the server does not  
                       support secure connections.        
                                                          
                       Not supported in all clients.      
                       Force a secure connection. An      
   sslmode=require     error occurs if the secure         
                       connection cannot be established.  
                       Force a secure connection and      
   sslmode=verify-ca   verify that the server certificate 
                       is signed by a known CA.           
                       Force a secure connection, verify                      
                       that the server certificate is     Use for secure      
   sslmode=verify-full signed by a known CA, and verify   deployments.
                       that the server address matches    
                       that specified in the certificate. 

   Warning:

   Some client drivers and the cockroach commands do not support
   sslmode=allow and sslmode=prefer. Check the documentation of your SQL
   driver to determine whether these options are supported.

  Example URL for an insecure connection

   The following URL is suitable to connect to a CockroachDB node using an
   insecure connection:

 postgres://root@servername:26257/mydb?sslmode=disable

   This specifies a connection for the root user to server servername on port
   26257 (the default CockroachDB SQL port), with mydb set as current
   database. sslmode=disable makes the connection insecure.

  Example URL for a secure connection

   The following URL is suitable to connect to a CockroachDB node using a
   secure connection:

 postgres://root@servername:26257/mydb?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=path/to/ca.crt&sslcert=path/to/client.username.crt&sslkey=path/to/client.username.key

   This uses the following components:

     * User root
     * Host name servername, port number 26257 (the default CockroachDB SQL
       port)
     * Current database mydb
     * SSL/TLS mode verify-full:
          * Root CA certificate path/to/ca.crt
          * Client certificate path/to/client.username.crt
          * Client key path/to/client.username.key

   For details about how to create and manage SSL/TLS certificates, see
   Create Security Certificates and Rotate Certificates.

  Example URI for a Unix domain socket

   The following URI is suitable to connect to a CockroachDB cluster
   listening for Unix domain socket connections at /path/to/client:

 postgres://root@?host=/path/to/client&port=26257

   This specifies a connection for the root user to an insecure cluster
   listening for a socket connection (e.g., a cluster started with the
   --socket-dir flag) at /path/to/client, and on port 26257.

Connect using discrete parameters

   Most cockroach commands accept connection parameters as separate, discrete
   command-line flags, in addition (or in replacement) to --url which
   specifies all parameters as a URL.

   For each command-line flag that directs a connection parameter,
   CockroachDB also recognizes an environment variable. The environment
   variable is used when the command-line flag is not specified.

   Flag        Description                                                    
               The server host and port number to connect to. This can be the 
               address of any node in the cluster.                            
   --host                                                                     
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_HOST                                   
               Default: localhost:26257                                       
               The server port to connect to. Note: The port number can also  
   --port      be specified via --host.                                       
   -p                                                                         
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_PORT                                   
               Default: 26257                                                 
               The SQL user that will own the client session.                 
   --user                                                                     
   -u          Env Variable: COCKROACH_USER                                   
               Default: root                                                  
               Use an insecure connection.                                    
   --insecure                                                                 
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_INSECURE                               
               Default: false                                                 
               The path to the certificate directory containing the CA and    
               client certificates and client key.                            
   --certs-dir                                                                
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_CERTS_DIR                              
               Default: ${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/                             
               A connection URL to use instead of the other arguments.        
   --url                                                                      
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_URL                                    
               Default: no URL                                                

  Example command-line flags for an insecure connection

   The following command-line flags establish an insecure connection:

 --user=root \
 --host=<servername>
 --insecure

   This specifies a connection for the root user to server servername on port
   26257 (the default CockroachDB SQL port). --insecure makes the connection
   insecure.

  Example command-line flags for a secure connection

   The following command-line flags establish a secure connection:

 --user=root \
 --host=<servername>
 --certs-dir=path/to/certs

   This uses the following components:

     * User root
     * Host name servername, port number 26257 (the default CockroachDB SQL
       port)
     * SSL/TLS enabled, with settings:
          * Root CA certificate path/to/certs/ca.crt
          * Client certificate path/to/client.<user>.crt
            (path/to/certs/client.root.crt with --user root)
          * Client key path/to/client.<user>.key
            (path/to/certs/client.root.key with --user root)
   Note:

   When using discrete connection parameters, the file names of the CA and
   client certificates and client key are derived automatically from the
   value of --certs-dir.

Using both URL and client parameters

   Most cockroach commands accept both a URL and client parameters. The
   information contained therein is combined in the order it appears in the
   command line.

   This combination is useful so that discrete command-line flags can
   override settings not otherwise set in the URL.

  Example override of the current database

   The cockroach start command prints out the following connection URL, which
   connects to the defaultdb database:

 postgres://root@servername:26257/?sslmode=disable

   To specify mydb as the current database using cockroach sql, run the
   following command:

 cockroach sql \
 --url "postgres://root@servername:26257/?sslmode=disable" \
 --database mydb

   This is equivalent to:

 cockroach sql --url "postgres://root@servername:26257/mydb?sslmode=disable"
