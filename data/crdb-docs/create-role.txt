                                  CREATE ROLE

   The CREATE ROLE statement creates SQL roles, which are groups containing
   any number of roles and users as members. You can assign privileges to
   roles, and all members of the role (regardless of whether if they are
   direct or indirect members) will inherit the role's privileges.

   Note:

   CREATE ROLE is no longer an enterprise feature and is now freely available
   in the core version of CockroachDB. Also, since the keywords ROLE and USER
   can now be used interchangeably in SQL statements for enhanced Postgres
   compatibility, CREATE ROLE is now an alias for CREATE USER.

Considerations

     * Role names:
          * Are case-insensitive
          * Must start with either a letter or underscore
          * Must contain only letters, numbers, periods, or underscores
          * Must be between 1 and 63 characters.
     * After creating roles, you must grant them privileges to databases and
       tables.
     * Roles and users can be members of roles.
     * Roles and users share the same namespace and must be unique.
     * All privileges of a role are inherited by all of its members.
     * There is no limit to the number of members in a role.
     * Roles cannot log in. They do not have a password and cannot use
       certificates.
     * Membership loops are not allowed (direct: A is a member of B is a
       member of A or indirect: A is a member of B is a member of C ... is a
       member of A).

Required privileges

   To create other roles, the role must have the CREATEROLE parameter set.

Synopsis

   CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS name

Parameters

   Parameter               Description                                        
                           The name of the role you want to create. Role      
                           names are case-insensitive; must start with either 
                           a letter or underscore; must contain only letters, 
   name                    numbers, periods, or underscores; and must be      
                           between 1 and 63 characters.                       
                                                                              
                           Note that roles and users share the same namespace 
                           and must be unique.                                
                           Let the role authenticate their access to a secure 
                           cluster using this password. Passwords should be   
                           entered as a string literal. For compatibility     
                           with PostgreSQL, a password can also be entered as 
   password                an identifier.                                     
                                                                              
                           To prevent a role from using password              
                           authentication and to mandate certificate-based    
                           client authentication, set the password as NULL.   
   VALID UNTIL             The date and time (in the timestamp format) after  
                           which the password is not valid.                   
                           Allow or disallow a role to login with one of the  
                           client authentication methods.                     
   LOGIN/NOLOGIN                                                              
                           By default, the parameter is set to NOLOGIN for    
                           the CREATE ROLE statement.                         
                           Allow or disallow the new role to create, alter,   
                           and drop other roles.                              
   CREATEROLE/NOCREATEROLE                                                    
                           By default, the parameter is set to NOCREATEROLE   
                           for all non-admin and non-root users.              

Examples

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE dev_ops;

 CREATE ROLE 1

   After creating roles, you can add users to the role and grant the role
   privileges.

  Allow the role to create other roles

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE dev with CREATEROLE;

  Create a role with a password using a string literal

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD 'ilov3beefjerky';

 CREATE ROLE 1

  Create a role with a password using an identifier

   The following statement sets the password to ilov3beefjerky, as above:

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD ilov3beefjerky;

   This is equivalent to the example in the previous section because the
   password contains only lowercase characters.

   In contrast, the following statement sets the password to
   thereisnotomorrow, even though the password in the syntax contains
   capitals, because identifiers are normalized automatically:

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD ThereIsNoTomorrow;

   To preserve case in a password specified using identifier syntax, use
   double quotes:

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD "ThereIsNoTomorrow";

  Prevent a role from using password authentication

   The following statement prevents the role from using password
   authentication and mandates certificate-based client authentication:

   copy

 > CREATE ROLE carl WITH PASSWORD NULL;
