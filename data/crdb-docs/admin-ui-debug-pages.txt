   The Advanced Debug page of the Admin UI provides links to advanced
   monitoring and troubleshooting reports and cluster configuration details.
   To view this page, access the Admin UI and click Advanced Debug in the
   left-hand navigation.

   Note:

   These pages are experimental and undocumented. If you find an issue, let
   us know through these channels.

License and node information

   On the right-side of the page, the following information is displayed:

     * CockroachDB license type: Helps determine if you have access to
       Enterprise features.
     * Current node ID: Helps identify the current node when viewing the
       Admin UI through a load balancer.
