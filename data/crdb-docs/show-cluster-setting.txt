                              SHOW CLUSTER SETTING

   The SHOW CLUSTER SETTING statement displays the values of cluster
   settings.

   To configure cluster settings, use SET CLUSTER SETTING.

   Note:

   The SHOW statement for cluster settings is unrelated to the other SHOW
   statements: SHOW (session variable), SHOW CREATE, SHOW USERS, SHOW
   DATABASES, SHOW COLUMNS, SHOW GRANTS, and SHOW CONSTRAINTS.

Details

     * To display the value of a specific cluster setting, use the following
       syntax:

 SHOW CLUSTER SETTING <setting>;

     * To display the values of public cluster settings (i.e., cluster
       settings that are documented and for which tuning is supported), use
       one of the following:

 SHOW CLUSTER SETTINGS;

 SHOW PUBLIC CLUSTER SETTINGS;

     * To display the values of all cluster settings use one of the
       following:

 SHOW ALL CLUSTER SETTINGS;

 SHOW CLUSTER SETTING ALL;

       When you display all cluster settings, the table output includes a
       public column that denotes whether a setting is public or not.

Required privileges

   Only members of the admin role can display cluster settings. By default,
   the root user belongs to the admin role.

Synopsis

   SHOW CLUSTER SETTING var_name ALL SETTINGS ALL PUBLIC CLUSTER SETTINGS

Parameters

   Parameter Description                                                      
   var_name  The name of the cluster setting (case-insensitive).              
   ALL       Display all cluster settings.                                    
             Display only the public cluster settings.                        
   PUBLIC    By default, only public settings are listed by SHOW CLUSTER      
             SETTINGS. SHOW PUBLIC CLUSTER SETTINGS and SHOW CLUSTER SETTINGS 
             are equivalent.                                                  

Response

   When you query multiple cluster settings (e.g., with SHOW CLUSTER
   SETTINGS, or with SHOW ALL CLUSTER SETTINGS), the following fields are
   returned:

   Field        Description                                                   
   variable     The name of the cluster setting.                              
   value        The value of the cluster setting.                             
                The type of the cluster setting.                              
                Possible values for setting_type include:                     
                  * b (true or false)                                         
                  * z (size, in bytes)                                        
   setting_type   * d (duration)                                              
                  * e (one of a set of possible values)                       
                  * f (floating-point value)                                  
                  * i (integer)                                               
                  * s (string)                                                
   description  A brief description of the cluster setting, including         
                possible values.                                              
                true if the cluster setting is public.                        
   public       This field is only included only if all cluster settings are  
                displayed.
