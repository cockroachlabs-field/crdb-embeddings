   The SQL dashboard in the CockroachDB Admin UI lets you monitor the
   performance of your SQL queries. To view this dashboard, access the Admin
   UI, click Metrics on the left-hand navigation bar, and then select
   Dashboard > SQL.

Dashboard navigation

   Use the Graph menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a
   specific node.

   To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a range selector allows you
   to filter the view for a predefined timeframe or custom date/time range.
   Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current
   timeframe. Note that the active timeframe is reflected in the URL and can
   be easily shared.

   The SQL dashboard displays the following time series graphs:

SQL Connections

   CockroachDB Admin UI SQL Connections

     * In the node view, the graph shows the number of connections currently
       open between the client and the selected node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the total number of SQL client
       connections to all nodes combined.

SQL Byte Traffic

   CockroachDB Admin UI SQL Byte Traffic

   The SQL Byte Traffic graph helps you correlate SQL query count to byte
   traffic, especially in bulk data inserts or analytic queries that return
   data in bulk.

     * In the node view, the graph shows the current byte throughput
       (bytes/second) between all the currently connected SQL clients and the
       node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the aggregate client throughput
       across all nodes.

SQL Queries

   CockroachDB Admin UI SQL Queries

     * In the node view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number
       of SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries per second issued by SQL
       clients on the node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the sum of the per-node averages,
       that is, an aggregate estimation of the current query load over the
       cluster, assuming the last 10 seconds of activity per node are
       representative of this load.

SQL Query Errors

   CockroachDB Admin UI SQL Query Errors

     * In the node view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number
       of SQL statements issued to the node that returned a planning,
       runtime, or retry error.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the
       number of SQL statements that returned a planning, runtime, or retry
       error across all nodes.

Service Latency: SQL, 99th percentile

   CockroachDB Admin UI Service Latency

   Service latency is calculated as the time between when the cluster
   receives a query and finishes executing the query. This time does not
   include returning results to the client.

     * In the node view, the graph displays the 99th percentile of service
       latency for the selected node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph displays the 99th percentile of service
       latency for each node in the cluster.

Transactions

   CockroachDB Admin UI Transactions

     * In the node view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number
       of opened, committed, aborted, and rolled back transactions per second
       issued by SQL clients on the node.

     * In the cluster view, the graph shows the sum of the per-node averages,
       that is, an aggregate estimation of the current transactions load over
       the cluster, assuming the last 10 seconds of activity per node are
       representative of this load.

   If the graph shows excessive aborts or rollbacks, it might indicate issues
   with the SQL queries. In that case, re-examine queries to lower
   contention.

   Additionally, per-application average transaction times are displayed for
   each node, at the 90th and 99th percentiles.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Transaction Latencies

Other graphs

   The SQL dashboard shows other time series graphs that are important for
   CockroachDB developers:

     * KV Execution Latency
     * Active Distributed SQL Queries
     * Active Flows for Distributed SQL Queries
     * Service Latency: DistSQL
     * Schema Changes

   For monitoring CockroachDB, it is sufficient to use the SQL Connections,
   SQL Byte Traffic, SQL Queries, Service Latency, and Transactions graphs.

Summary and events

  Summary panel

   A Summary panel of key metrics is displayed to the right of the timeseries
   graphs.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Summary Panel

   Metric             Description                                             
   Total Nodes        The total number of nodes in the cluster.               
                      Decommissioned nodes are not included in this count.    
   Capacity Used      The storage capacity used as a percentage of usable     
                      capacity allocated across all nodes.                    
   Unavailable Ranges The number of unavailable ranges in the cluster. A      
                      non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.          
   Queries per second The total number of SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  
                      queries executed per second across the cluster.         
   P99 Latency        The 99th percentile of service latency.                 

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

  Events panel

   Underneath the Summary panel, the Events panel lists the 5 most recent
   events logged for all nodes across the cluster. To list all events, click
   View all events.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Events

   The following types of events are listed:

     * Database created
     * Database dropped
     * Table created
     * Table dropped
     * Table altered
     * Index created
     * Index dropped
     * View created
     * View dropped
     * Schema change reversed
     * Schema change finished
     * Node joined
     * Node decommissioned
     * Node restarted
     * Cluster setting changed
