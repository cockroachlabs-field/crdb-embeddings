  Delete statistics

   To delete statistics for all tables in all databases:

   copy

 > DELETE FROM system.table_statistics WHERE true;

   To delete a named set of statistics (e.g, one named "my_stats"), run a
   query like the following:

   copy

 > DELETE FROM system.table_statistics WHERE name = 'my_stats';

   After deleting statistics, restart the nodes in your cluster to clear the
   statistics caches.

   For more information about the DELETE statement, see DELETE.
