                            Default Value Constraint

   The DEFAULT value constraint specifies a value to write into the
   constrained column if one is not defined in an INSERT statement. The value
   may be either a hard-coded literal or an expression that is evaluated at
   the time the row is created.

Details

     * The data type of the Default Value must be the same as the data type
       of the column.
     * The DEFAULT value constraint only applies if the column does not have
       a value specified in the INSERT statement. You can still insert a NULL
       into an optional (nullable) column by explicitly inserting NULL. For
       example, INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, NULL);.

Syntax

   You can only apply the DEFAULT value constraint to individual columns.

   Note:

   You can also add the DEFAULT value constraint to an existing table through
   ALTER COLUMN.

   CREATE TABLE table_name ( column_name column_type DEFAULT default_value
   column_constraints , column_def table_constraints ) )

   Parameter          Description                                             
   table_name         The name of the table you're creating.                  
   column_name        The name of the constrained column.                     
   column_type        The constrained column's data type.                     
   default_value      The value you want to insert by default, which must     
                      evaluate to the same data type as the column_type.      
   column_constraints Any other column-level constraints you want to apply to 
                      this column.                                            
   column_def         Definitions for any other columns in the table.         
   table_constraints  Any table-level constraints you want to apply.          

Example

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE inventories (
     product_id        INT,
     warehouse_id      INT,
     quantity_on_hand  INT DEFAULT 100,
     PRIMARY KEY (product_id, warehouse_id)
   );

   copy

 > INSERT INTO inventories (product_id, warehouse_id) VALUES (1,20);

   copy

 > INSERT INTO inventories (product_id, warehouse_id, quantity_on_hand) VALUES (2,30, NULL);

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM inventories;

 +------------+--------------+------------------+
 | product_id | warehouse_id | quantity_on_hand |
 +------------+--------------+------------------+
 |          1 |           20 |              100 |
 |          2 |           30 | NULL             |
 +------------+--------------+------------------+

   If the DEFAULT value constraint is not specified and an explicit value is
   not given, a value of NULL is assigned to the column.
