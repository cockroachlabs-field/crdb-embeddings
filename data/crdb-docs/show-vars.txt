   The SHOW statement can display the value of either one or all of the
   session setting variables. Some of these can also be configured via SET.

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to display the session settings.

Synopsis

   SHOW SESSION var_name ALL
   Note:
   The SHOW statement for session settings is unrelated to the other SHOW
   statements: SHOW CLUSTER SETTING, SHOW CREATE, SHOW USERS, SHOW DATABASES,
   SHOW COLUMNS, SHOW GRANTS, and SHOW CONSTRAINTS.

Parameters

   The SHOW <session variable> statement accepts a single parameter: the
   variable name.

   The variable name is case insensitive. It may be enclosed in double
   quotes; this is useful if the variable name itself contains spaces.

  Supported variables

                                                                                       Modify View
