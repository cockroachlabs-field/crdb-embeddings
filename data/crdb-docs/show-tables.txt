                                  SHOW TABLES

   The SHOW TABLES statement lists the tables or views in a schema or
   database.

   Note:

   While a table or view is being dropped, SHOW TABLES will list the object
   with a (dropped) suffix.

Synopsis

   SHOW TABLES FROM database_name . schema_name WITH COMMENT

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to list the tables in a schema or database.

Parameters

   Parameter     Description                                        
   database_name The name of the database for which to show tables. 
   schema_name   The name of the schema for which to show tables.   

   When a database_name and schema_name are omitted, the tables of the
   current schema in the current database are listed.

   SHOW TABLES will attempt to find a schema with the specified name first.
   If that fails, it will try to find a database with that name instead, and
   list the tables of its public schema. For more details, see Name
   Resolution.

Examples

  Setup

   The following examples use MovR, a fictional vehicle-sharing application,
   to demonstrate CockroachDB SQL statements. For more information about the
   MovR example application and dataset, see MovR: A Global Vehicle-sharing
   App.

   To follow along, run cockroach demo to start a temporary, in-memory
   cluster with the movr dataset preloaded:

   copy

 $ cockroach demo

  Show tables in the current database

   SHOW TABLES uses the current schema public set by default in search_path:

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES;

           table_name
 +----------------------------+
   promo_codes
   rides
   user_promo_codes
   users
   vehicle_location_histories
   vehicles
 (6 rows)

   Alternatively, within the built-in SQL shell, you can use the \dt shell
   command:

   copy

 > \dt

           table_name
 +----------------------------+
   promo_codes
   rides
   user_promo_codes
   users
   vehicle_location_histories
   vehicles
 (6 rows)

  Show tables in a different schema

   You can show the tables in schemas other than the current schema. You can
   also show the schema by table:

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM movr.information_schema;

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;

   Because movr is the current database, these statements return the same
   output:

              table_name
 +-----------------------------------+
   administrable_role_authorizations
   applicable_roles
   column_privileges
   columns
   constraint_column_usage
   enabled_roles
   key_column_usage
   parameters
   referential_constraints
   role_table_grants
   routines
   schema_privileges
   schemata
   sequences
   statistics
   table_constraints
   table_privileges
   tables
   user_privileges
   views
 (20 rows)

  Show tables in a different database

   You can also show tables from a different database.

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM system.public;

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM system;

   Because public is the current schema, these statements return the same
   output:

      table_name
 +------------------+
   comments
   descriptor
   eventlog
   jobs
   lease
   locations
   namespace
   rangelog
   role_members
   settings
   table_statistics
   ui
   users
   web_sessions
   zones
 (15 rows)

  Show user-defined tables with comments

   You can use COMMENT ON to add comments on a table.

   copy

 > COMMENT ON TABLE users IS 'This table contains information about users.';

   To view a table's comments:

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM movr WITH COMMENT;

           table_name         |                   comment
 +----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
   users                      | This table contains information about users.
   vehicles                   |
   rides                      |
   vehicle_location_histories |
   promo_codes                |
   user_promo_codes           |
 (6 rows)

   You can also view comments on a table with SHOW CREATE:

   copy

 > SHOW CREATE TABLE users;

   table_name |                             create_statement
 -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   users      | CREATE TABLE users (
              |     id UUID NOT NULL,
              |     city VARCHAR NOT NULL,
              |     name VARCHAR NULL,
              |     address VARCHAR NULL,
              |     credit_card VARCHAR NULL,
              |     CONSTRAINT "primary" PRIMARY KEY (city ASC, id ASC),
              |     FAMILY "primary" (id, city, name, address, credit_card)
              | );
              | COMMENT ON TABLE users IS 'This table contains information about users.'
 (1 row)

   For more information, see COMMENT ON.

  Show virtual tables with comments

   The virtual tables in the pg_catalog, information_schema, and
   crdb_internal schemas contain useful comments, often with links to further
   documentation.

   To view virtual tables with comments and documentation links, use SHOW
   TABLES FROM <virtual schema> WITH COMMENT:

   copy

 > SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema WITH COMMENT;

              table_name             |                                                              comment
 +-----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
