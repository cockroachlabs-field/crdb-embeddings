   The cockroach debug zip command connects to your cluster and gathers
   information from each active node into a single file (inactive nodes are
   not included):

     * Log files
     * Secondary log files (e.g., RocksDB logs, execution logs, slow query
       logs)
     * Cluster events
     * Schema change events
     * Node liveness
     * Gossip data
     * Stack traces
     * Range lists
     * A list of databases and tables
     * Jobs
     * Cluster Settings
     * Metrics
     * Alerts
     * Heap profiles
     * Problem ranges
     * Sessions
     * Queries
     * Thread stack traces (Linux only)

   Additionally, you can run the debug merge-logs command to merge the
   collected logs in one file, making it easier to parse them to locate an
   issue with your cluster.

   Warning:

   The file produced by cockroach debug zip can contain highly sensitive,
   unanonymized information, such as usernames, hashed passwords, and
   possibly your table's data. You should share this data only with Cockroach
   Labs developers and only after determining the most secure method of
   delivery.

Details

  Use cases

   There are two scenarios in which debug zip is useful:

     * To collect all of your nodes' logs, which you can then parse to locate
       issues. It's important to note, though, that debug zip can only access
       logs from active nodes. See more information on this page.

     * If you experience severe or difficult-to-reproduce issues with your
       cluster, Cockroach Labs might ask you to send us your cluster's
       debugging information using cockroach debug zip.

  Collecting log files

   When you issue the debug zip command, the node that receives the request
   connects to each other node in the cluster. Once it's connected, the node
   requests the content of all log files stored on the node, the location of
   which is determined by the --log-dir value when you started the node.

   Because debug zip relies on CockroachDB's distributed architecture, this
   means that nodes not currently connected to the cluster cannot respond to
   the request, so their log files are not included. In such situations, we
   recommend using the --host flag to point debug zip at individual nodes
   until data has been gathered for the entire cluster.

   After receiving the log files from all of the active nodes, the requesting
   node aggregates the files and writes them to an archive file you specify.

   You can locate logs in the unarchived file's debug/nodes/[node dir]/logs
   directories.

Subcommands

   While the cockroach debug command has a few subcommands, users are
   expected to use only the zip, encryption-active-key, merge-logs, and
   ballast subcommands.

   The other debug subcommands are useful only to CockroachDB's developers
   and contributors.

Synopsis

 $ cockroach debug zip [ZIP file destination] [flags]

   It's important to understand that the [flags] here are used to connect to
   CockroachDB nodes. This means the values you use in those flags must
   connect to an active node. If no nodes are live, you must start at least
   one node.

Flags

   The debug zip subcommand supports the following general-use, client
   connection, and logging flags.

  General

   Flag        Description                                                    
               The path to the certificate directory. The directory must      
               contain valid certificates if running in secure mode.          
   --certs-dir                                                                
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_CERTS_DIR                              
               Default: ${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/                             
               The server host to connect to. This can be the address of any  
               node in the cluster.                                           
   --host                                                                     
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_HOST                                   
               Default: localhost                                             
               Run in insecure mode. If this flag is not set, the --certs-dir 
               flag must point to valid certificates.                         
   --insecure                                                                 
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_INSECURE                               
               Default: false                                                 
               The server port to connect to.                                 
   --port                                                                     
   -p          Env Variable: COCKROACH_PORT                                   
               Default: 26257                                                 

  Client connection

   Flag  Description                                             
         A connection URL to use instead of the other arguments. 
   --url                                                         
         Env Variable: COCKROACH_URL                             
         Default: no URL                                         

  Logging

   By default, the debug zip command logs errors it experiences to stderr.
   Note that these are errors executing debug zip; these are not errors that
   the logs collected by debug zip contain.

   If you need to troubleshoot this command's behavior, you can also change
   its logging behavior.

Examples

  Generate a debug zip file

   copy

 # Generate the debug zip file for an insecure cluster:
 $ cockroach debug zip ./cockroach-data/logs/debug.zip --insecure --host=200.100.50.25

   copy

 # Generate the debug zip file for a secure cluster:
 $ cockroach debug zip ./cockroach-data/logs/debug.zip --host=200.100.50.25

   Note:
   Secure examples assume you have the appropriate certificates in the
   default certificate directory, ${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/.
