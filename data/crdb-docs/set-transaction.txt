   The SET TRANSACTION statement sets the transaction priority, access mode,
   and "as of" timestamp after you BEGIN it but before executing the first
   statement that manipulates a database.

Synopsis

   SET TRANSACTION PRIORITY LOW NORMAL HIGH READ ONLY WRITE AS OF SYSTEM TIME
   a_expr ,

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to set the transaction priority. However,
   privileges are required for each statement within a transaction.

Parameters

   Parameter         Description                                              
                     If you do not want the transaction to run with NORMAL    
                     priority, you can set it to LOW or HIGH.                 
                                                                              
                     Transactions with higher priority are less likely to     
                     need to be retried.                                      
   PRIORITY                                                                   
                     For more information, see Transactions: Priorities.      
                                                                              
                     The current priority is also exposed as the session      
                     variable transaction_priority.                           
                                                                              
                     Default: NORMAL                                          
                     Set the transaction access mode to READ ONLY or READ     
                     WRITE. The current transaction access mode is also       
   READ              exposed as the session variable transaction_read_only.   
                                                                              
                     Default: READ WRITE                                      
                     Execute the transaction using the database contents "as  
                     of" a specified time in the past.                        
                                                                              
                     The AS OF SYSTEM TIME clause can be used only when the   
   AS OF SYSTEM TIME transaction is read-only. If the transaction contains    
                     any writes, or if the READ WRITE mode is specified, an   
                     error will be returned.                                  
                                                                              
                     For more information, see AS OF SYSTEM TIME.             

   CockroachDB now only supports SERIALIZABLE isolation, so transactions can
   no longer be meaningfully set to any other ISOLATION LEVEL. In previous
   versions of CockroachDB, you could set transactions to SNAPSHOT isolation,
   but that feature has been removed.

Examples

  Set priority

   Warning:
   This example assumes you're using client-side intervention to handle
   transaction retries.
   copy

 > BEGIN;

   copy

 > SET TRANSACTION PRIORITY HIGH;

   copy

 > SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;

   copy

 > UPDATE products SET inventory = 0 WHERE sku = '8675309';

   copy

 > INSERT INTO orders (customer, sku, status) VALUES (1001, '8675309', 'new');

   copy

 > RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;

   copy

 > COMMIT;

  Use the AS OF SYSTEM TIME option

   You can execute the transaction using the database contents "as of" a
   specified time in the past.

   copy

 > BEGIN;

   copy

 > SET TRANSACTION AS OF SYSTEM TIME '2019-04-09 18:02:52.0+00:00';

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM orders;

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM products;

   copy

 > COMMIT;
