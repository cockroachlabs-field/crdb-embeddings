   The RENAME CONSTRAINT statement changes the name of a constraint on a
   column.

   Note:

   It is not possible to rename a constraint for a column referenced by a
   view. For more details, see View Dependencies.

   Tip:

   This command can be combined with other ALTER TABLE commands in a single
   statement. For a list of commands that can be combined, see ALTER TABLE.
   For a demonstration, see Add and rename columns atomically.

   );

   copy

   table_name |        constraint_name         | constraint_type |                details                 | validated
 +------------+--------------------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
   logon      | logon_customer_id_sales_id_key | UNIQUE          | UNIQUE (customer_id ASC, sales_id ASC) |   true
   logon      | primary                        | PRIMARY KEY     | PRIMARY KEY (login_id ASC)             |   true
