   CockroachDB supports various signed integer data types.

   Note:

   For instructions showing how to auto-generate integer values (e.g., to
   auto-number rows in a table), see this FAQ entry.

Syntax

   A constant value of type INT can be entered as a numeric literal. For
   example: 42, -1234, or 0xCAFE.

Size

   The different integer types place different constraints on the range of
   allowable values, but all integers are stored in the same way regardless
   of type. Smaller values take up less space than larger ones (based on the
   numeric value, not the data type).

  Considerations for 64-bit signed integers

   By default, INT is an alias for INT8, which creates 64-bit signed
   integers. This differs from the Postgres default for INT, which is 32
   bits, and may cause issues for your application if it is not written to
   handle 64-bit integers, whether due to the language your application is
   written in, or the ORM/framework it uses to generate SQL (if any).

   For example, JavaScript language runtimes represent numbers as 64-bit
   floats, which means that the JS runtime can only represent 53 bits of
   numeric accuracy and thus has a max safe value of 2^53, or
   9007199254740992. This means that the maximum size of a default INT in
   CockroachDB is much larger than JavaScript can represent as an integer.
   Visually, the size difference is as follows:

 9223372036854775807 # INT default max value
    9007199254740991 # JS integer max value

   Given the above, if a table contains a column with a default-sized INT
   value, and you are reading from it or writing to it via JavaScript, you
   will not be able to read and write values to that column correctly. This
   issue can pop up in a surprising way if you are using a framework that
   autogenerates both frontend and backend code (such as twirp). In such
   cases, you may find that your backend code can handle 64-bit signed
   integers, but the generated client/frontend code cannot.

   If your application needs to use an integer size that is different than
   the CockroachDB default (for these or other reasons), you can change one
   or both of the settings below. For example, you can set either of the
   below to 4 to cause INT and SERIAL to become aliases for INT4 and SERIAL4,
   which use 32-bit integers.

    1. The default_int_size session variable.
    2. The sql.defaults.default_int_size cluster setting.
   Tip:

   If your application requires arbitrary precision numbers, use the DECIMAL
   data type.

Examples

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE ints (a INT PRIMARY KEY, b SMALLINT);

   copy

 > SHOW COLUMNS FROM ints;

   column_name | data_type | is_nullable | column_default | generation_expression |  indices  | is_hidden
 --------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-----------+------------
   a           | INT8      |    false    | NULL           |                       | {primary} |   false
   b           | INT2      |    true     | NULL           |                       | {}        |   false
 (2 rows)

   copy

 > INSERT INTO ints VALUES (1, 32);

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM ints;

   a | b
 ----+-----
   1 | 32
 (1 row)

Supported casting and conversion

   INT values can be cast to any of the following data types:

   Type      Details                                                          
   DECIMAL   ––                                                               
   FLOAT     Loses precision if the INT value is larger than 2^53 in          
             magnitude.                                                       
             Converts to the binary representation of the integer value. If   
   BIT       the value is negative, the sign bit is replicated on the left to 
             fill the entire bit array.                                       
   BOOL      0 converts to false; all other values convert to true.           
             Converts to days since the Unix epoch (Jan. 1, 1970). This is a  
   DATE      CockroachDB experimental feature which may be changed without    
             notice.                                                          
             Converts to seconds since the Unix epoch (Jan. 1, 1970). This is 
   TIMESTAMP a CockroachDB experimental feature which may be changed without  
             notice.                                                          
   INTERVAL  Converts to microseconds.                                        
   STRING    ––
