   The DBeaver database tool is a tool that completely integrates with
   CockroachDB to provide a GUI for managing your database.

   According to the DBeaver website:

     DBeaver is a cross-platform Database GUI tool for developers, SQL
     programmers, database administrators, and analysts.

   In this tutorial, you'll work through the process of using DBeaver with a
   secure CockroachDB cluster.

   Tip:

   For more information about using DBeaver, see the DBeaver documentation.

   If you run into problems, please file an issue on the DBeaver issue
   tracker.

Before You Begin

   To work through this tutorial, take the following steps:

     * Install CockroachDB and start a secure cluster.
     * Download a copy of DBeaver version 5.2.3 or greater.

Step 1. Start DBeaver and connect to CockroachDB

   Start DBeaver, and select Database > New Connection from the menu. In the
   dialog that appears, select CockroachDB from the list.

   DBeaver - Select CockroachDB

Step 2. Update the connection settings

   On the Create new connection dialog that appears, click Network settings.

   From the network settings, click the SSL tab. It will look like the
   screenshot below.

   Check the Use SSL checkbox as shown, and fill in the text areas as
   follows:

     * Root certificate: Use the ca.crt file you generated for your secure
       cluster.
     * SSL certificate: Use a client certificate generated from your
       cluster's root certificate. For the root user, this will be named
       client.root.crt. For additional security, you may want to create a new
       database user and client certificate just for use with DBeaver.
     * SSL certificate key: Because DBeaver is a Java application, you will
       need to transform your key file to the *.pk8 format using an OpenSSL
       command like the one shown below. Once you have created the file,
       enter its location here. In this example, the filename is
       client.root.pk8.
       copy

 $ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in client.root.key -out client.root.pk8 -nocrypt

   Select require from the SSL mode dropdown. There is no need to set the SSL
   Factory, you can let DBeaver use the default.

Step 3. Test the connection settings

   Click Test Connection .... If everything worked, you will see a Success
   dialog like the one shown below.

Step 4. Start using DBeaver

   Click Finish to get started using DBeaver with CockroachDB.
