   The SHOW JOBS statement lists all of the types of long-running tasks your
   cluster has performed in the last 12 hours, including:

     * Schema changes through ALTER TABLE, DROP DATABASE, DROP TABLE, and
       TRUNCATE
     * IMPORT
     * Enterprise BACKUP and RESTORE
     * User-created table statistics created for use by the cost-based
       optimizer
     * The automatic table statistics are not displayed on running the SHOW
       JOBS statement. To view the automatic table statistics, use SHOW
       AUTOMATIC JOBS

   These details can help you understand the status of crucial tasks that can
   impact the performance of your cluster, as well as help you control them.

   To block a call to SHOW JOBS that returns after all specified job ID(s)
   have a terminal state, use SHOW JOBS WHEN COMPLETE. The statement will
   return a row per job ID, which provides details of the job execution. Note
   that while this statement is blocking, it will time out after 24 hours.

Considerations

     * The SHOW JOBS statement shows only long-running tasks. For an
       exhaustive list of jobs running in the cluster, use the SQL Audit
       Logging (Experimental) feature.
     * For jobs older than 12 hours, query the crdb_internal.jobs table.
     * Jobs are deleted after 14 days. This interval can be changed via the
       jobs.retention_time cluster setting.
     * While the SHOW JOBS WHEN COMPLETE statement is blocking, it will time
       out after 24 hours.
     * Garbage collection jobs are created for dropped tables and dropped
       indexes, and will execute after the GC TTL has elapsed (default is 25
       hours). These jobs cannot be canceled.

Required privileges

   By default, only the root user can execute SHOW JOBS.

Synopsis

   SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS JOBS WHEN COMPLETE select_stmt JOB WHEN COMPLETE
   job_id

Parameters

   Parameter   Description                                             
   select_stmt A selection query that specifies the job_id(s) to view. 
   job_id      The ID of the job you want to view.                     

Response

   The output of SHOW JOBS lists ongoing jobs first, then completed jobs
   within the last 12 hours. The list of ongoing jobs is sorted by starting
   time, whereas the list of completed jobs is sorted by finished time.

   The following fields are returned for each job:

   Field              Description                                             
                      A unique ID to identify each job. This value is used if 
   job_id             you want to control jobs (i.e., pause, resume, or       
                      cancel it).                                             
                      The type of job. Possible values: SCHEMA CHANGE,        
                      BACKUP, RESTORE, IMPORT, and CREATE STATS.              
   job_type                                                                   
                      For SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS, the possible value is AUTO     
                      CREATE STATS.                                           
   description        The statement that started the job, or a textual        
                      description of the job.                                 
                      When description is a textual description of the job,   
   statement          the statement that started the job is returned in this  
                      column. Currently, this field is populated only for the 
                      automatic table statistics jobs.                        
   user_name          The name of the user who started the job.               
   status             The job's current state. Possible values: pending,      
                      running, paused, failed, succeeded, or canceled.        
                      The job's detailed running status, which provides       
                      visibility into the progress of the dropping or         
                      truncating of tables (i.e., DROP TABLE, DROP DATABASE,  
                      or TRUNCATE). For dropping or truncating jobs, the      
                      detailed running status is determined by the status of  
                      the table at the earliest stage of the schema change.   
   running_status     The job is completed when the GC TTL expires and both   
                      the table data and ID is deleted for each of the tables 
                      involved. Possible values: draining names, waiting for  
                      GC TTL, RocksDB compaction, or NULL (when the status    
                      cannot be determined).                                  
                                                                              
                      For the SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS statement, the value of     
                      this field is NULL.                                     
   created            The TIMESTAMP when the job was created.                 
   started            The TIMESTAMP when the job began running first.         
   finished           The TIMESTAMP when the job was succeeded, failed, or    
                      canceled.                                               
   modified           The TIMESTAMP when the job had anything modified.       
   fraction_completed The fraction (between 0.00 and 1.00) of the job that's  
                      been completed.                                         
   error              If the job failed, the error generated by the failure.  
   coordinator_id     The ID of the node running the job.                     

Examples

  Show jobs

   copy

 > SHOW JOBS;

      job_id     | job_type  |               description                 |...
 +---------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+...
  27536791415282 |  RESTORE  | RESTORE db.* FROM 'azure://backup/db/tbl' |...

  Filter jobs

   You can filter jobs by using SHOW JOBS as the data source for a SELECT
   statement, and then filtering the values with the WHERE clause.

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE job_type = 'RESTORE' AND status IN ('running', 'failed') ORDER BY created DESC;

      job_id     | job_type  |              description                  |...
 +---------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+...
  27536791415282 |  RESTORE  | RESTORE db.* FROM 'azure://backup/db/tbl' |...


  Show automatic jobs

   copy

 > SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS;

         job_id       |       job_type      |                    description                      |...
 +--------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+...
   438235476849557505 | AUTO CREATE STATS   | Table statistics refresh for defaultdb.public.users |...
 (1 row)

  Filter automatic jobs

   You can filter jobs by using SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS as the data source for a
   SELECT statement, and then filtering the values with the WHERE clause.

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM [SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS] WHERE status = ('succeeded') ORDER BY created DESC;

         job_id       |       job_type      |                    description                      | ...
 +--------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ ...
   438235476849557505 | AUTO CREATE STATS   | Table statistics refresh for defaultdb.public.users | ...
 (1 row)

  Show schema changes

   You can show just schema change jobs by using SHOW JOBS as the data source
   for a SELECT statement, and then filtering the job_type value with the
   WHERE clause:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE job_type = 'SCHEMA CHANGE';

      job_id     | job_type        |              description                           |...
 +---------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+...
  27536791415282 |  SCHEMA CHANGE  | ALTER TABLE test.public.foo ADD COLUMN bar VARCHAR |...

   Scheme change jobs can be paused, resumed, and canceled.

  Show job when complete

   To block SHOW JOB until the provided job ID reaches a terminal state, use
   SHOW JOB WHEN COMPLETE:

   copy

 > SHOW JOB WHEN COMPLETE 27536791415282;

      job_id     | job_type  |               description                 |...
 +---------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+...
  27536791415282 |  RESTORE  | RESTORE db.* FROM 'azure://backup/db/tbl' |...
