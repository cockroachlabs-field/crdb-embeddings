                                   CANCEL JOB

   The CANCEL JOB statement lets you stop long-running jobs, which include
   IMPORT jobs, enterprise BACKUP and RESTORE jobs, schema changes,
   user-created table statistics jobs, automatic table statistics jobs,
   changefeeds, and schema change jobs.

Limitations

   When an enterprise RESTORE is canceled, partially restored data is
   properly cleaned up. This can have a minor, temporary impact on cluster
   performance.

Required privileges

   Only members of the admin role can cancel a job. By default, the root user
   belongs to the admin role.

Synopsis

   CANCEL JOB job_id JOBS select_stmt

Parameters

   Parameter   Description                                                    
   job_id      The ID of the job you want to cancel, which can be found with  
               SHOW JOBS.                                                     
   select_stmt A selection query that returns job_id(s) to cancel.            

Examples

  Cancel a single job

 > SHOW JOBS;

 +----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
 |       id       |  type   |               description                 |...
 +----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
 | 27536791415282 | RESTORE | RESTORE db.* FROM 'azure://backup/db/tbl' |...
 +----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...

 > CANCEL JOB 27536791415282;

  Cancel multiple jobs

   To cancel multiple jobs, nest a SELECT clause that retrieves job_id(s)
   inside the CANCEL JOBS statement:

   copy

 > CANCEL JOBS (SELECT job_id FROM [SHOW JOBS]
       WHERE user_name = 'maxroach');

   All jobs created by maxroach will be cancelled.

  Cancel automatic table statistics jobs

   Canceling an automatic table statistics job is not useful since the system
   will automatically restart the job immediately. To permanently disable
   automatic table statistics jobs, disable the
   sql.stats.automatic_collection.enabled cluster setting:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.stats.automatic_collection.enabled = false;
