   The DATE data type stores a year, month, and day.

Syntax

   A constant value of type DATE can be expressed using an interpreted
   literal, or a string literal annotated with type DATE or coerced to type
   DATE.

   The string format for dates is YYYY-MM-DD. For example: DATE '2016-12-23'.

   CockroachDB also supports using uninterpreted string literals in contexts
   where a DATE value is otherwise expected.

   Note:

   DATE values in CockroachDB are fully PostgreSQL-compatible, including
   support for special values (e.g. +/- infinity). Existing dates outside of
   the PostgreSQL date range (4714-11-24 BC to 5874897-12-31) are converted
   to +/- infinity dates.

Size

   A DATE column supports values up to 16 bytes in width, but the total
   storage size is likely to be larger due to CockroachDB metadata.

Examples

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE dates (a DATE PRIMARY KEY, b INT);

   copy

 > SHOW COLUMNS FROM dates;

 +-------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-------------+
 | column_name | data_type | is_nullable | column_default | generation_expression |   indices   |
 +-------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-------------+
 | a           | DATE      |    false    | NULL           |                       | {"primary"} |
 | b           | INT       |    true     | NULL           |                       | {}          |
 +-------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-------------+
 (2 rows)

   Explicitly typed DATE literal:
   copy

 > INSERT INTO dates VALUES (DATE '2016-03-26', 12345);

   String literal implicitly typed as DATE:
   copy

 > INSERT INTO dates VALUES ('2016-03-27', 12345);

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM dates;

 +---------------------------+-------+
 |             a             |   b   |
 +---------------------------+-------+
 | 2016-03-26 00:00:00+00:00 | 12345 |
 | 2016-03-27 00:00:00+00:00 | 12345 |
 +---------------------------+-------+

Supported casting and conversion

   DATE values can be cast to any of the following data types:
