                                   DROP ROLE

   The DROP ROLE statement removes one or more SQL roles.

   Note:

   DROP ROLE is no longer an enterprise feature and is now freely available
   in the core version of CockroachDB. Also, since the keywords ROLE and USER
   can now be used interchangeably in SQL statements for enhanced Postgres
   compatibility, DROP ROLE is now an alias for DROP USER.

Considerations

     * The admin role cannot be dropped, and root must always be a member of
       admin.
     * A role cannot be dropped if it has privileges. Use REVOKE to remove
       privileges.

Required privileges

   Roles can only be dropped by super users, i.e., members of the admin role.

   To drop other non-admin roles, the role must have the CREATEROLE parameter
   set.

Synopsis

   DROP ROLE IF EXISTS name

Parameters

   Parameter Description                                                      
             The name of the role to remove. To remove multiple roles, use a  
   name      comma-separate list of roles.                                    
                                                                              
             You can use SHOW ROLES to find the names of roles.               

Example

   In this example, first check a role's privileges. Then, revoke the role's
   privileges and remove the role.

   copy

 > SHOW GRANTS ON documents FOR dev_ops;

 +------------+--------+-----------+---------+------------+
 |  Database  | Schema |   Table   |  User   | Privileges |
 +------------+--------+-----------+---------+------------+
 | jsonb_test | public | documents | dev_ops | INSERT     |
 +------------+--------+-----------+---------+------------+

   copy

 > REVOKE INSERT ON documents FROM dev_ops;

   Note:
   All of a role's privileges must be revoked before the role can be dropped.
   copy

 > DROP ROLE dev_ops;

 DROP ROLE 1
