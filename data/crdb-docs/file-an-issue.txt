   If you've tried to troubleshoot an issue yourself, have reached out for
   help, and are still stumped, you can file an issue in GitHub.

   To file an issue in GitHub, we need the following information:

    1. A summary of the issue.

    2. The steps to reproduce the issue.

    3. The result you expected.

    4. The result that actually occurred.

    5. The first few lines of the log file from each node in the cluster in a
       timeframe as close as possible to reproducing the issue. On most
       Unix-based systems running with defaults, you can get this information
       using the following command:

       copy

 $ grep -F '[config]' cockroach-data/logs/cockroach.log

       Note:
       You might need to replace cockroach-data/logs with the location of
       your logs.

       If the logs are not available, please include the output of cockroach
       version for each node in the cluster.
