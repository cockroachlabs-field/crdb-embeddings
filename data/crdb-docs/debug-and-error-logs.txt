                         Understand Debug & Error Logs

   If you need to troubleshoot issues with your cluster, you can check a
   node's logs, which include details about certain node-level and
   range-level events, such as errors. For example, if CockroachDB crashes,
   it normally logs a stack trace to what caused the problem.

   Tip:

   CockroachDB also generates secondary logs for queries being executed
   against your system. See SQL logging for details on obtaining these logs.

Details

   When a node processes a cockroach command, it produces a stream of
   messages about the command's activities. Each message's body describes the
   activity, and its envelope contains metadata such as the message's
   severity level.

   As a command generates messages, CockroachDB uses the command's logging
   flags and the message's severity level to determine the appropriate
   location for it.

   Each node's logs detail only the internal activity of that node without
   visibility into the behavior of other nodes in the cluster. When
   troubleshooting, this means that you must identify the node where the
   problem occurred or collect the logs from all active nodes in your
   cluster.

  Commands

   All cockroach commands support logging. However, it's important to note:

     * cockroach start generates most messages related to the operation of
       your cluster.
     * Other commands do generate messages, but they're typically only
       interesting in troubleshooting scenarios.

  Severity levels

   CockroachDB identifies each message with a severity level, letting
   operators know if they need to intercede:

    1. INFO (lowest severity; no action necessary)
    2. WARNING
    3. ERROR
    4. FATAL (highest severity; requires operator attention)

   Default behavior by severity level

   Command            INFO messages WARNING and above messages 
   cockroach start    Write to file Write to file              
   All other commands Discard       Print to stderr            

  Output locations

   Based on the command's flags and the message's severity level, CockroachDB
   does one of the following:

     * Writes the message to a file
     * Prints it to stderr
     * Discards the message entirely

    Write to file

   CockroachDB can write messages to log files. The files are named using the
   following format:

 cockroach.[host].[user].[start timestamp in UTC].[process ID].log

   For example:

 cockroach.richards-mbp.rloveland.2018-03-15T15_24_10Z.024338.log

   To make it easier to watch a log without knowing the full filename, a
   symlink with the short filename cockroach.log is also created. This
   symlink points to the most recent log.

   Note:

   All log file timestamps are in UTC because CockroachDB is designed to be
   deployed in a distributed cluster. Nodes may be located in different time
   zones, and using UTC makes it easy to correlate log messages from those
   nodes no matter where they are located.

   Threshold    
   Disabled by  --log-dir=""^1                 Default                        

   Note:

   ^1 If the cockroach process does not have access to on-disk storage,
   cockroach start does not write messages to log files; instead it prints
   all messages to stderr.

   Tip:

   Log files can be accessed using the Admin UI, which displays them in JSON
   format.

    1. Access the Admin UI and then click Advanced Debug in the left-hand
       navigation.

    2. Under Raw Status Endpoints (JSON), click Log Files to view the JSON of
       all collected logs.

    3. Copy one of the log filenames. Then click Specific Log File and
       replace the cockroach.log placeholder in the URL with the filename.

    Print to stderr

   CockroachDB can print messages to stderr, which normally prints them to
   the machine's terminal but does not store them.

   Property             cockroach start               All other commands      
   Enabled by           Explicit --logtostderr flag^2 Default                 
   Default Severity     N/A                           WARNING                 
   Level Threshold      
   Change Severity      --logtostderr=[severity       --logtostderr=[severity 
   Threshold            level]                        level]                  
   Disabled by          Default^2                     --logtostderr=NONE      

   Note:
   ^2 cockroach start does not print any messages to stderr unless the
   cockroach process does not have access to on-disk storage, in which case
   it defaults to --logtostderr=INFO and prints all messages to stderr.

    Discard message

   Messages with severity levels below the --logtostderr and
   --log-file-verbosity flag's values are neither written to files nor
   printed to stderr, so they are discarded.

   By default, commands besides cockroach start discard messages with the
   INFO severity level.

Flags

   These logging flags are used with cockroach commands.

   Flag                 Description                                           
                        Enable logging to files and write logs to the         
                        specified directory.                                  
   --log-dir                                                                  
                        Setting --log-dir to a blank directory (--log-dir="") 
                        disables logging to files.                            
                        After the log directory reaches the specified size,   
                        delete the oldest log file. The flag's argument takes 
   --log-dir-max-size   standard file sizes, such as --log-dir-max-size=1GiB. 
                                                                              
                        Default: 100MiB                                       
                        After logs reach the specified size, begin writing    
                        logs to a new file. The flag's argument takes         
   --log-file-max-size  standard file sizes, such as                          
                        --log-file-max-size=2MiB.                             
                                                                              
                        Default: 10MiB                                        
                        Only writes messages to log files if they are at or   
                        above the specified severity level, such as           
   --log-file-verbosity --log-file-verbosity=WARNING. Requires logging to     
                        files.                                                
                                                                              
                        Default: INFO                                         
                        Enable logging to stderr for messages at or above the 
                        specified severity level, such as --logtostderr=ERROR 
                                                                              
                        If you use this flag without specifying the severity  
   --logtostderr        level (e.g., cockroach start --logtostderr), it       
                        prints messages of all severities to stderr.          
                                                                              
                        Setting --logtostderr=NONE disables logging to        
                        stderr.                                               
                        Do not colorize stderr. Possible values: true or      
                        false.                                                
                                                                              
   --no-color           When set to false, messages logged to stderr are      
                        colorized based on severity level.                    
                                                                              
                        Default: false                                        
                        New in v2.0: If non-empty, create a SQL audit log in  
                        this directory. By default, SQL audit logs are        
   --sql-audit-dir      written in the same directory as the other logs       
                        generated by CockroachDB. For more information, see   
                        SQL Audit Logging.
