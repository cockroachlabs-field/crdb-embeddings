   CockroachDB's support of the PostgreSQL wire protocol enables support for
   many drivers, ORMs, and other types of third-party database tools.

Support levels

   We’ve partnered with open-source projects, vendors, and individuals to
   offer the following levels of support with third-party tools.

     * Full support indicates that the vast majority of the tool's features
       should work without issue with CockroachDB. CockroachDB is regularly
       tested against the recommended version documented here.
     * Beta support indicates that the tool has been tried with CockroachDB,
       but its integration might require additional steps, lack support for
       all features, or exhibit unexpected behavior.

   If you encounter problems, please open an issue with details to help us
   make progress toward better support.
