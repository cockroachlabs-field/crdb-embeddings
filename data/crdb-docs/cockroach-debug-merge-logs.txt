   The cockroach debug merge-logs command merges log files from multiple
   nodes into a single time-ordered stream of messages with an added
   per-message prefix to indicate the corresponding node. You can use it in
   conjunction with logs collected using the debug zip command to aid in
   debugging.

   Warning:

   The file produced by cockroach debug merge-log can contain highly
   sensitive, unanonymized information, such as usernames, passwords, and
   possibly your table's data. You should share this data only with Cockroach
   Labs developers and only after determining the most secure method of
   delivery.

Subcommands

   While the cockroach debug command has a few subcommands, users are
   expected to use only the zip, encryption-active-key, merge-logs, and
   ballast subcommands.

   The other debug subcommands are useful only to CockroachDB's developers
   and contributors.

Synopsis

 $ cockroach debug merge-logs [log file directory] [flags]

Flags

   Use the following flags to filter the debug merge-logs results for a
   specified regular expression or time range.

   Flag     Description                                           
   --filter Limit the results to the specified regular expression 
   --from   Start time for the time range filter.                 
   --to     End time for the time range filter.                   

Example

   Generate a debug zip file:

   copy

 $ cockroach debug zip ./cockroach-data/logs/debug.zip --insecure

   Unzip the file:

   copy

 $ unzip ./cockroach-data/logs/debug.zip

   Merge the logs in the debug folder:

   copy

 $ cockroach debug merge-logs debug/nodes/*/logs/*

   Alternatively, filter the merged logs for a specified time range:

   copy

 $ cockroach debug merge-logs debug/nodes/*/logs/* --from= "18:36:28.208553" --to= "18:36:29.232864"

   You can also filter the merged logs for a regular expression:

   copy

 cockroach debug merge-logs debug/nodes/*/logs/* --filter="RUNNING IN INSECURE MODE"
