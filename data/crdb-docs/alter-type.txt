                                   ALTER TYPE

   The ALTER TYPE statement is part of ALTER TABLE and changes a column's
   data type.

   Tip:

   This command can be combined with other ALTER TABLE commands in a single
   statement. For a list of commands that can be combined, see ALTER TABLE.
   For a demonstration, see Add and rename columns atomically.

Considerations

   You can use the ALTER TYPE subcommand if the following conditions are met:

     * On-disk representation of the column remains unchanged. For example,
       you cannot change the column data type from STRING to an INT, even if
       the string is just a number.
     * The existing data remains valid. For example, you can change the
       column data type from STRING[10] to STRING[20], but not to STRING [5]
       since that will invalidate the existing data.

Synopsis

   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET DATA TYPE
   typename

Required privileges

   The user must have the CREATE privilege on the table.

Parameters

   Parameter   Description                                                    
   table_name  The name of the table with the column whose data type you want 
               to change.                                                     
   column_name The name of the column whose data type you want to change.     
   typename    The new data type you want to use.                             

Viewing schema changes

   This schema change statement is registered as a job. You can view
   long-running jobs with SHOW JOBS.

Examples

  Success scenario

   The TPC-C database has a customer table with a column c_credit_lim DECIMAL
   (10,2). Suppose you want to change the data type to DECIMAL (12,2):

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE customer ALTER c_credit_lim type DECIMAL (12,2);

 ALTER TABLE

 Time: 80.814044ms

  Error scenarios

   Changing a column data type from DECIMAL to INT would change the on-disk
   representation of the column. Therefore, attempting to do so results in an
   error:

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE customer ALTER c_credit_lim type INT;

 pq: type conversion not yet implemented

   Changing a column data type from DECIMAL(12,2) to DECIMAL (8,2) would
   invalidate the existing data. Therefore, attempting to do so results in an
   error:

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE customer ALTER c_credit_lim type DECIMAL (8,2);

 pq: type conversion not yet implemented
