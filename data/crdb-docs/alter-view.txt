   The ALTER VIEW statement changes the name of a view.

   Note:

   This statement performs a schema change. For more information about how
   online schema changes work in CockroachDB, see Online Schema Changes.

   Note:

   It is not currently possible to change the SELECT statement executed by a
   view. Instead, you must drop the existing view and create a new view.
   Also, it is not currently possible to rename a view that other views
   depend on, but this ability may be added in the future (see this issue).

Required privileges

   The user must have the DROP privilege on the view and the CREATE privilege
   on the parent database.

Synopsis

   ALTER VIEW IF EXISTS view_name RENAME TO name

Parameters

   Parameter Description                                                      
   IF EXISTS Rename the view only if a view of view_name exists; if one does  
             not exist, do not return an error.                               
             The name of the view to rename. To find view names, use:         
   view_name                                                                  
             SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type =       
             'VIEW';                                                          
   name      The new name for the view, which must be unique to its database  
             and follow these identifier rules.                               

Example

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'VIEW';

 +---------------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------+
 | TABLE_CATALOG |   TABLE_SCHEMA    |     TABLE_NAME     | TABLE_TYPE | VERSION |
 +---------------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------+
 | def           | bank              | user_accounts      | VIEW       |       2 |
 | def           | bank              | user_emails        | VIEW       |       1 |
 +---------------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------+
 (2 rows)

   copy

 > ALTER VIEW bank.user_emails RENAME TO bank.user_email_addresses;

   copy

 > RENAME VIEW

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'VIEW';

 +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+---------+
 | TABLE_CATALOG |   TABLE_SCHEMA    |      TABLE_NAME      | TABLE_TYPE | VERSION |
 +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+---------+
 | def           | bank              | user_accounts        | VIEW       |       2 |
 | def           | bank              | user_email_addresses | VIEW       |       3 |
 +---------------+-------------------+----------------------+------------+---------+
 (2 rows)
