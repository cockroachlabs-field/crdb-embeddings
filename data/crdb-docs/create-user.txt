                                  CREATE USER

   The CREATE USER statement creates SQL users, which let you control
   privileges on your databases and tables.

   Note:

   Since the keywords ROLE and USER can now be used interchangeably in SQL
   statements for enhanced Postgres compatibility, CREATE USER is now an
   alias for CREATE ROLE.

Considerations

     * Usernames:
          * Are case-insensitive
          * Must start with a letter, number, or underscore
          * Must contain only letters, numbers, periods, or underscores
          * Must be between 1 and 63 characters.
     * After creating users, you must grant them privileges to databases and
       tables.
     * All users belong to the public role, to which you can grant and revoke
       privileges.
     * On secure clusters, you must create client certificates for users and
       users must authenticate their access to the cluster.

Required privileges

   To create other users, the user must have the CREATEROLE parameter set.

Synopsis

   CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS name WITH PASSWORD password

Parameters

   Parameter               Description                                        
                           The name of the user you want to create.           
                                                                              
   user_name               Usernames are case-insensitive; must start with a  
                           letter, number, or underscore; must contain only   
                           letters, numbers, or underscores; and must be      
                           between 1 and 63 characters.                       
                           Let the user authenticate their access to a secure 
                           cluster using this password. Passwords should be   
                           entered as a string literal. For compatibility     
                           with PostgreSQL, a password can also be entered as 
   password                an identifier.                                     
                                                                              
                           To prevent a user from using password              
                           authentication and to mandate certificate-based    
                           client authentication, set the password as NULL.   
   VALID UNTIL             The date and time (in the timestamp format) after  
                           which the password is not valid.                   
                           The LOGIN parameter allows a user to login with    
                           one of the user authentication methods. Setting    
                           the parameter to NOLOGIN prevents the user from    
   LOGIN/NOLOGIN           logging in using any authentication method.        
                                                                              
                           By default, the parameter is set to LOGIN for the  
                           CREATE USER statement.                             
                           Allow or disallow the new user to create, alter,   
                           and drop other users.                              
   CREATEROLE/NOCREATEROLE                                                    
                           By default, the parameter is set to NOCREATEROLE   
                           for all non-admin and non-root users.              

User authentication

   Secure clusters require users to authenticate their access to databases
   and tables. CockroachDB offers three methods for this:

     * Client certificate and key authentication, which is available to all
       users. To ensure the highest level of security, we recommend only
       using client certificate and key authentication.

     * Password authentication, which is available to users and roles who
       you've created passwords for. To create a user with a password, use
       the WITH PASSWORD clause of CREATE USER. To add a password to an
       existing user, use the ALTER USER statement.

       Users can use passwords to authenticate without supplying client
       certificates and keys; however, we recommend using certificate-based
       authentication whenever possible.

       Password creation is supported only in secure clusters.

     * GSSAPI authentication, which is available to Enterprise users.

Examples

  Create a user

   Usernames are case-insensitive; must start with a letter, number, or
   underscore; must contain only letters, numbers, periods, or underscores;
   and must be between 1 and 63 characters.

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl;

   After creating users, you must:

     * Grant them privileges to databases.
     * For secure clusters, you must also create their client certificates.

  Allow the user to create other users

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl with CREATEROLE;

  Create a user with a password

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl WITH PASSWORD 'ilov3beefjerky';

 CREATE USER 1

  Create a user with a password using an identifier

   The following statement changes the password to ilov3beefjerky, as above:

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl WITH PASSWORD ilov3beefjerky;

   This is equivalent to the example in the previous section because the
   password contains only lowercase characters.

   In contrast, the following statement changes the password to
   thereisnotomorrow, even though the password in the syntax contains
   capitals, because identifiers are normalized automatically:

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl WITH PASSWORD ThereIsNoTomorrow;

   To preserve case in a password specified using identifier syntax, use
   double quotes:

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl WITH PASSWORD "ThereIsNoTomorrow";

  Prevent a user from using password authentication

   The following statement prevents the user from using password
   authentication and mandates certificate-based client authentication:

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl WITH PASSWORD NULL;

  Set password validity

   The following statement sets the date and time after which the password is
   not valid:

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl VALID UNTIL '2021-01-01';

  Manage users

   After creating a user, you can use the ALTER USER statement to add or
   change the user's password, update role options, and the DROP USER
   statement to the remove users.

  Authenticate as a specific user

   Secure Insecure

    Secure clusters with client certificates

   All users can authenticate their access to a secure cluster using a client
   certificate issued to their username.

   copy

 $ cockroach sql --user=carl

    Secure clusters with passwords

   Users with passwords can authenticate their access by entering their
   password at the command prompt instead of using their client certificate
   and key.

   If we cannot find client certificate and key files matching the user, we
   fall back on password authentication.

   copy

 $ cockroach sql --user=carl

   copy

 $ cockroach sql --insecure --user=carl

  Set login privileges for a user

   The following statement prevents the user from logging in using any user
   authentication method:

   copy

 > CREATE USER carl NOLOGIN;

   copy

 > SHOW USERS;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     | NOLOGIN    | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)

   To allow the user to log in using one of the user authentication methods,
   use the ALTER USER statement:

   copy

 > ALTER USER carl LOGIN;

   copy

 > SHOW USERS;

   username |  options   | member_of
 -----------+------------+------------
   admin    | CREATEROLE | {}
   carl     |            | {}
   root     | CREATEROLE | {admin}
 (3 rows)
