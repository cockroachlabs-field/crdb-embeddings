                             Changefeeds Dashboard

   The Changefeeds dashboard in the CockroachDB Admin UI lets you monitor the
   changefeeds created across your cluster. To view this dashboard, access
   the Admin UI, click Metrics on the left-hand navigation bar, and then
   select Dashboard > Changefeeds.

Dashboard navigation

   Use the Graph menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a
   specific node.

   To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a range selector allows you
   to filter the view for a predefined timeframe or custom date/time range.
   Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current
   timeframe. Note that the active timeframe is reflected in the URL and can
   be easily shared.

   The Changefeeds dashboard displays the following time series graphs:

Max Changefeed Latency

   This graph shows the maximum latency for resolved timestamps of any
   running changefeed.

   Note:

   The maximum latency for resolved timestamps is distinct from and slower
   than the commit-to-emit latency for individual change messages. For more
   information about resolved timestamps, see Ordering guarantees.

Sink Byte Traffic

   This graph shows the number of bytes emitted by CockroachDB into the sink
   for changefeeds.

   Emitted Bytes The number of bytes emitted by CockroachDB into the sink for 
                 changefeeds.                                                 

Sink Counts

   This graph shows:

     * The number of messages that CockroachDB sent to the sink.
     * The number of flushes that the sink performed for changefeeds.

   Messages The number of messages that CockroachDB sent to the sink for      
            changefeeds.                                                      
   Flushes  The the number of flushes that the sink performed for             
            changefeeds.                                                      

Sink Timings

   This graph shows:

     * The time in milliseconds per second required by CockroachDB to send
       messages to the sink.
     * The time CockroachDB spent waiting for the sink to flush the messages
       for changefeeds.

                     The time in milliseconds per second that CockroachDB     
   Flush Time        spent waiting for the sink to flush the messages for     
                     changefeeds.                                             

Changefeed Restarts

   This graph displays the number of times changefeeds restarted due to
   retryable errors.

Summary and events

  Summary panel

   A Summary panel of key metrics is displayed to the right of the timeseries
   graphs.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Summary Panel

   Metric             Description                                             
   Total Nodes        The total number of nodes in the cluster.               
                      Decommissioned nodes are not included in this count.    
   Capacity Used      The storage capacity used as a percentage of usable     
                      capacity allocated across all nodes.                    
   Unavailable Ranges The number of unavailable ranges in the cluster. A      
                      non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.          
   Queries per second The total number of SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  
                      queries executed per second across the cluster.         
   P99 Latency        The 99th percentile of service latency.                 

   Note:

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

  Events panel

   Underneath the Summary panel, the Events panel lists the 5 most recent
   events logged for all nodes across the cluster. To list all events, click
   View all events.

   CockroachDB Admin UI Events

   The following types of events are listed:

     * Database created
     * Database dropped
     * Table created
     * Table dropped
     * Table altered
     * Index created
     * Index dropped
     * View created
     * View dropped
     * Schema change reversed
     * Schema change finished
     * Node joined
     * Node decommissioned
     * Node restarted
     * Cluster setting changed
