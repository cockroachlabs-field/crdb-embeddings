   The cockroach nodelocal upload command uploads a file to the external IO
   directory on a node's (the gateway node, by default) local file system.

   This command takes in a source file to upload and a destination filename.
   It will then use a SQL connection to upload the file to the node's local
   file system, at externalIODir/destination/filename.

   Note:

   The source file is only uploaded to one node, not all of the nodes.

Required privileges

   Only members of the admin role can run cockroach nodelocal upload. By
   default, the root user belongs to the admin role.

Considerations

   The --external-io flag on the node you're uploading to cannot be set to
   disabled.

Synopsis

 $ cockroach nodelocal upload <location/of/file> <destination/of/file> [flags]

Examples

  Upload a file

   To upload a file to the default node (i.e., the gateway node):

   copy

 $ cockroach nodelocal upload ./grants.csv test/grants.csv --certs-dir=certs

 successfully uploaded to nodelocal://1/test/grants.csv

   Then, you can use the file to IMPORT or IMPORT INTO data.

  Upload a file to a specific node

   To upload a file to a specific node (e.g., node 2), use the --host flag:

   copy

 $ cockroach nodelocal upload ./grants.csv grants.csv --host=localhost:26259 --insecure

 successfully uploaded to nodelocal://2/grants.csv

   Or, use the --url flag:

   copy

 $ cockroach nodelocal upload ./grants.csv grants.csv --url=postgresql://root@localhost:26258?sslmode=disable --insecure

 successfully uploaded to nodelocal://3/grants.csv

   Then, you can use the file to IMPORT or IMPORT INTO data.
