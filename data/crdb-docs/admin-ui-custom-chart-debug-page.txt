   The Custom Chart debug page in the Admin UI can be used to create one or
   multiple custom charts showing any combination of over 200 available
   metrics.

   The definition of the customized dashboard is encoded in the URL. To share
   the dashboard with someone, send them the URL. Like any other URL, it can
   be bookmarked, sit in a pinned tab in your browser, etc.

Accessing the Custom Chart page

   To access the Custom Chart debug page, access the Admin UI, and either:

     * Open http://localhost:8080/#/debug/chart in your browser (replacing
       localhost and 8080 with your node's host and port).

     * Click the gear icon on the left to access the Advanced Debugging Page.
       In the Reports section, click Custom TimeSeries Chart.

Using the Custom Chart page

   CockroachDB Admin UI

   On the Custom Chart page, you can set the time span for all charts, add
   new custom charts, and customize each chart:

     * To set the time span for the page, use the dropdown menu above the
       charts and select the desired time span.

     * To add a chart, click Add Chart and customize the new chart.

     * To customize each chart, use the Units dropdown menu to set the units
       to display. Then use the table below the chart to select the metrics
       being queried, and how they'll be combined and displayed. Options
       include:

       Column      Description                                                
       Metric Name How the system refers to this metric, e.g., sql.bytesin.   
                   The "Downsampler" operation is used to combine the         
                   individual datapoints over the longer period into a single 
                   datapoint. We store one data point every ten seconds, but  
                   for queries over long time spans the backend lowers the    
                   resolution of the returned data, perhaps only returning    
                   one data point for every minute, five minutes, or even an  
       Downsampler entire hour in the case of the 30 day view.                
                                                                              
                   Options:                                                   
                     * AVG: Returns the average value over the time period.   
                     * MIN: Returns the lowest value seen.                    
                     * MAX: Returns the highest value seen.                   
                     * SUM: Returns the sum of all values seen.               
                   Used to combine data points from different nodes. It has   
                   the same operations available as the Downsampler.          
                                                                              
       Aggregator  Options:                                                   
                     * AVG: Returns the average value over the time period.   
                     * MIN: Returns the lowest value seen.                    
                     * MAX: Returns the highest value seen.                   
                     * SUM: Returns the sum of all values seen.               
                   Determines how to display the rate of change during the    
                   selected time period.                                      
                                                                              
                   Options:                                                   
                                                                              
                     * Normal: Returns the actual recorded value.             
                     * Rate: Returns the rate of change of the value per      
                       second.                                                
                     * Non-negative Rate: Returns the rate-of-change, but     
       Rate            returns 0 instead of negative values. A large number   
                       of the stats we track are actually tracked as          
                       monotonically increasing counters so each sample is    
                       just the total value of that counter. The rate of      
                       change of that counter represents the rate of events   
                       being counted, which is usually what you want to       
                       graph. "Non-negative Rate" is needed because the       
                       counters are stored in memory, and thus if a node      
                       resets it goes back to zero (whereas normally they     
                       only increase).                                        
                   The set of nodes being queried, which is either:           
       Source        * The entire cluster.                                    
                     * A single, named node.                                  
       Per Node    If checked, the chart will show a line for each node's     
                   value of this metric.                                      

Examples

  Query user and system CPU usage

   CockroachDB Admin UI

   To compare system vs. userspace CPU usage, select the following values
   under Metric Name:

     * sys.cpu.sys.percent
     * sys.cpu.user.percent

   The Y-axis label is the Count. A count of 1 represents 100% utilization.
   The Aggregator of Sum can show the count to be above 1, which would mean
   CPU utilization is greater than 100%.

   Checking Per Node displays statistics for each node, which could show
   whether an individual node's CPU usage was higher or lower than the
   average.

Available metrics

   Note:

   This list is taken directly from the source code and is subject to change.
   Some of the metrics listed below are already visible in other areas of the
