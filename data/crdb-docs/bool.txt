   The BOOL data type stores a Boolean value of false or true.

Aliases

   In CockroachDB, BOOLEAN is an alias for BOOL.

Syntax

   There are two predefined named constants for BOOL: TRUE and FALSE (the
   names are case-insensitive).

   Alternately, a boolean value can be obtained by coercing a numeric value:
   zero is coerced to FALSE, and any non-zero value to TRUE.

     * CAST(0 AS BOOL) (false)
     * CAST(123 AS BOOL) (true)

Size

   A BOOL value is 1 byte in width, but the total storage size is likely to
   be larger due to CockroachDB metadata.

Examples

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE bool (a INT PRIMARY KEY, b BOOL, c BOOLEAN);

   copy

 > SHOW COLUMNS FROM bool;

 +-------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-------------+
 | column_name | data_type | is_nullable | column_default | generation_expression |   indices   |
 +-------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-------------+
 | a           | INT       |    false    | NULL           |                       | {"primary"} |
 | b           | BOOL      |    true     | NULL           |                       | {}          |
 | c           | BOOL      |    true     | NULL           |                       | {}          |
 +-------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-------------+
 (3 rows)

   copy

 > INSERT INTO bool VALUES (12345, true, CAST(0 AS BOOL));

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM bool;

 +-------+------+-------+
 |   a   |  b   |   c   |
 +-------+------+-------+
 | 12345 | true | false |
 +-------+------+-------+

Supported casting and conversion

   BOOL values can be cast to any of the following data types:

   Type    Details                        
   INT     Converts true to 1, false to 0 
   DECIMAL Converts true to 1, false to 0 
   FLOAT   Converts true to 1, false to 0 
   STRING  ––
