   The SHOW SAVEPOINT STATUS statement lists the active savepoints in the
   current transaction.

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to create or show a savepoint. However,
   privileges are required for each statement within a transaction.

Synopsis

   SHOW SAVEPOINT STATUS

Response

   The following fields are returned for each savepoint.

   Field                Description                                           
   savepoint_name       The name of the savepoint.                            
   is_initial_savepoint Whether the savepoint is the outermost savepoint in   
                        the transaction.                                      

Example

   First, open a transaction using BEGIN, and create a nested transaction
   using a savepoint:

   copy

 > BEGIN;
 SAVEPOINT foo;

   Next, use the SHOW SAVEPOINT STATUS statement to list the active
   savepoints in the current nested transaction.

   copy

 > SHOW SAVEPOINT STATUS;

   savepoint_name | is_initial_savepoint
 -----------------+-----------------------
   foo            |        true
 (1 row)

   Currently, there is only one savepoint.

   We can commit this nested transaction by issuing the RELEASE SAVEPOINT
   statement. Then, we clear the connection for the next transaction by
   issuing a COMMIT statement.

   copy

 > RELEASE SAVEPOINT foo;
 COMMIT;

   If we did not want to commit this nested transaction, but restart it
   instead, we would have issued a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT.
