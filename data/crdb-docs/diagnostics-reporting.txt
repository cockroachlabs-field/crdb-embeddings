                             Diagnostics Reporting

   By default, the Admin UI and each node of a CockroachDB cluster share
   anonymous usage details with Cockroach Labs. These details, which are
   completely scrubbed of identifiable information, greatly help us
   understand and improve how the system behaves in real-world scenarios.

   This page summarizes the details that get shared, how to view the details
   yourself, and how to opt out of sharing.

   Tip:

   For insights into your cluster's performance and health, use the built-in
   Admin UI or a third-party monitoring tool like Prometheus.

What gets shared

   When diagnostics reporting is on, each node of a CockroachDB cluster
   shares anonymized details on an hourly basis, including (but not limited
   to):

     * Deployment and configuration characteristics, such as size of
       hardware, cluster settings that have been altered from defaults,
       number of replication zones configured, etc.
     * Usage and cluster health details, such as crashes, unexpected errors,
       attempts to use unsupported features, types of queries run and their
       execution characteristics as well as types of schemas used, etc.

   To view the full diagnostics details that a node reports to Cockroach
   Labs, use the http://<node-address>:<http-port>/_status/diagnostics/local
   JSON endpoint.

   Note:

   In all cases, names and other string values are scrubbed and replaced with
   underscores. Also, the details that get shared may change over time, but
   as that happens, we will announce the changes in release notes.

Opt out of diagnostics reporting

  At cluster initialization

   To make sure that absolutely no diagnostic details are shared, you can set
   the environment variable COCKROACH_SKIP_ENABLING_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORTING=true
   before starting the first node of the cluster. Note that this works only
   when set before starting the first node of the cluster. Once the cluster
   is running, you need to use the SET CLUSTER SETTING method described
   below.

  After cluster initialization

   To stop sending diagnostic details to Cockroach Labs once a cluster is
   running, use the built-in SQL client to execute the following SET CLUSTER
   SETTING statement, which switches the diagnostics.reporting.enabled
   cluster setting to false:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING diagnostics.reporting.enabled = false;

   This change will not be instantaneous, as it must be propagated to other
   nodes in the cluster.

Check the state of diagnostics reporting

   To check the state of diagnostics reporting, use the built-in SQL client
   to execute the following SHOW CLUSTER SETTING statement:

   copy

 > SHOW CLUSTER SETTING diagnostics.reporting.enabled;

   diagnostics.reporting.enabled
 +-------------------------------+
               false
 (1 row)

   If the setting is false, diagnostics reporting is off; if the setting is
   true, diagnostics reporting is on.
