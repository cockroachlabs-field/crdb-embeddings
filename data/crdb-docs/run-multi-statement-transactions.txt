   This page has instructions for running multi-statement transactions
   against CockroachDB from various programming languages.

Before you begin

   Make sure you have already:

     * Set up a local cluster.
     * Installed a Postgres client.
     * Connected to the database.
     * Inserted data that you now want to run queries against.
   Note:

   Your application should use a retry loop to handle transaction errors that
   can occur under contention.

Run a transaction

   SQL Go Java Python
   copy

 BEGIN;
 DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
 DELETE orders WHERE customer = 1;
 COMMIT;

   For more information about how to use the built-in SQL client, see the
   cockroach sql reference docs.

   The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Go code is to use
   one of the following approaches:

     * Use the crdb transaction wrapper which automatically handles
       transaction retry errors if they occur, as shown in Build a Go App
       with CockroachDB.

     * Write your own retry loop wrapper, as shown in Build a Go App with
       CockroachDB and GORM

   The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Java is to write a
   wrapper method that automatically handles transaction retry errors.

   For complete examples showing how to write and use such wrapper methods,
   see Build a Java App with CockroachDB.

   The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Python code is to
   use one of the following approaches:

     * Use the sqlalchemy-cockroachdb SQLAlchemy dialect, which automatically
       handles transaction retry errors if they occur, as shown in Build a
       Python App with CockroachDB and SQLAlchemy.

     * Write your own retry loop wrapper, as shown in Build a Python App with
       CockroachDB.
