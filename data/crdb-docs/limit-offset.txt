                             Limiting Query Results

   The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses restrict the operation of:

     * A selection query, including when it occurs as part of INSERT or
       UPSERT.
     * UPDATE and DELETE statements.

Synopsis

   LIMIT count FETCH FIRST NEXT count ROW ROWS ONLY
   OFFSET a_expr c_expr ROW ROWS

   LIMIT restricts the operation to only retrieve limit_val number of rows.

   OFFSET restricts the operation to skip the first offset_value number of
   rows. It is often used in conjunction with LIMIT to "paginate" through
   retrieved rows.

   Warning:

   Using LIMIT/OFFSET to implement pagination can be very slow for large
   tables. We recommend using keyset pagination instead.

   For PostgreSQL compatibility, CockroachDB also supports FETCH FIRST
   limit_val ROWS ONLY and FETCH NEXT limit_val ROWS ONLY as aliases for
   LIMIT. If limit_val is omitted, then one row is fetched.

Examples

   For example uses with SELECT, see Limiting Row Count and Pagination.
