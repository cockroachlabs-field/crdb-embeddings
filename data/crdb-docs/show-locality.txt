   The SHOW LOCALITY statement returns the locality of the current node.

   If locality was not specified on node startup, the statement returns an
   empty row.

Required privileges

   No privileges are required to list the locality of the current node.

Synopsis

   SHOW LOCALITY

Example

  Setup

   The following example uses MovR, a fictional vehicle-sharing application,
   to demonstrate CockroachDB SQL statements. For more information about the
   MovR example application and dataset, see MovR: A Global Vehicle-sharing
   App.

   To follow along, run cockroach demo movr with the --nodes and
   --demo-locality tags. This command opens an interactive SQL shell to a
   temporary, multi-node in-memory cluster with the movr database preloaded
   and set as the current database.

   copy

 $ cockroach demo movr --nodes=3 --demo-locality=region=us-east,az=a:region=us-central,az=b:region=us-west1,az=c

  Show locality

   copy

 > SHOW LOCALITY;

        locality
 +---------------------+
   region=us-east,az=a
 (1 row)

  Show locality with a built-in function

   If you know the locality key, you can use the crdb_internal.locality_value
   built-in function to return the locality value for the current node:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM crdb_internal.locality_value('region');

   crdb_internal.locality_value
 +------------------------------+
   us-east
 (1 row)

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM crdb_internal.locality_value('az');

   crdb_internal.locality_value
 +------------------------------+
   a
 (1 row)

   For a more extensive example, see Create a table with node locality
   information.
