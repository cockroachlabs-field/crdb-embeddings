   This page explains the cockroach init command, which you use to perform a
   one-time initialization of a new multi-node cluster. For a full
   walk-through of the cluster startup and initialization process, see one of
   the Manual Deployment tutorials.

   Note:

   When starting a single-node cluster with cockroach start-single-node, you
   do not need to use the cockroach init command.

Synopsis

   Perform a one-time initialization of a cluster:

   copy

 $ cockroach init <flags>

   View help:

   copy

 $ cockroach init --help

Flags

   The cockroach init command supports the following client connection and
   logging flags.

  Client connection

   Flag        Description                                                    
               The server host and port number to connect to. This can be the 
               address of any node in the cluster.                            
   --host

               The server port to connect to. Note: The port number can also  
   --port      be specified via --host.                                       
   -p                                                                         
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_PORT

               The SQL user that will own the client session.                 
   --user                                                                     
   -u          Env Variable: COCKROACH_USER                                   
               Default: root                                                  
               Use an insecure connection.                                    
   --insecure                                                                 
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_INSECURE                               
               Default: false                                                 
               The path to the certificate directory containing the CA and    
               client certificates and client key.                            
   --certs-dir                                                                
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_CERTS_DIR                              
               Default: ${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/                             
               A connection URL to use instead of the other arguments.        
   --url                                                                      
               Env Variable: COCKROACH_URL                                    
               Default: no URL                                                

   See Client Connection Parameters for details.

  Logging

   By default, the init command logs errors to stderr.

   If you need to troubleshoot this command's behavior, you can change its
   logging behavior.

Examples

   These examples assume that nodes have already been started with cockroach
   start but are waiting to be initialized as a new cluster. For a more
   detailed walk-through, see one of the Manual Deployment tutorials.

  Initialize a Cluster on a Node's Machine

   Secure Insecure
    1. SSH to the machine where the node has been started.

    2. Make sure the client.root.crt and client.root.key files for the root
       user are on the machine.

    3. Run the cockroach init command with the --certs-dir flag set to the
       directory containing the ca.crt file and the files for the root user,
       and with the --host flag set to the address of the current node:

       copy

 $ cockroach init --certs-dir=certs --host=<address of this node>

       At this point, all the nodes complete startup and print helpful
       details to the standard output, such as the CockroachDB version, the
       URL for the Admin UI, and the SQL URL for clients.

    1. SSH to the machine where the node has been started.

    2. Run the cockroach init command with the --host flag set to the address
       of the current node:

       copy

 $ cockroach init --insecure --host=<address of this node>

       At this point, all the nodes complete startup and print helpful
       details to the standard output, such as the CockroachDB version, the
       URL for the Admin UI, and the SQL URL for clients.

  Initialize a cluster from another machine

   Secure Insecure
    1. Install the cockroach binary on a machine separate from the node.

    2. Create a certs directory and copy the CA certificate and the client
       certificate and key for the root user into the directory.

    3. Run the cockroach init command with the --certs-dir flag set to the
       directory containing the ca.crt file and the files for the root user,
       and with the --host flag set to the address of any node:

       copy

 $ cockroach init --certs-dir=certs --host=<address of any node>

       At this point, all the nodes complete startup and print helpful
       details to the standard output, such as the CockroachDB version, the
       URL for the Admin UI, and the SQL URL for clients.

    1. Install the cockroach binary on a machine separate from the node.

    2. Run the cockroach init command with the --host flag set to the address
       of any node:

       copy

 $ cockroach init --insecure --host=<address of any node>

       At this point, all the nodes complete startup and print helpful
       details to the standard output, such as the CockroachDB version, the
       URL for the Admin UI, and the SQL URL for clients.
