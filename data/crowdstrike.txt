Last month, a global IT outage made international headlines, with news reports carrying images of travellers stranded at airports as staff were met with the so-called “blue screen of death”.

The outage was caused by an update from security software provider CrowdStrike to enterprise services provided by Microsoft. While CrowdStrike rapidly issued a fix, millions of machines affected by the outage had to be rebooted manually to continue functioning. 

Banks and financial services firms were hit by the July 19 outage in various ways. Beyond its immediate impact, the episode also provided a lens through which to scrutinise the structures set up by major banks to ensure IT resilience. 

While banks in the EU are gearing up for the Digital Operational Resilience Act, UK lenders have been working under a regime introduced by the supervisory authorities — the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England — since March 2022. UK regulators have also been consulting on their proposed new critical third-party regime, which looks at the impact of third-party suppliers, with final rules and expectations expected towards the end of 2024. 

Spurred on by the digital acceleration experienced by the wider banking industry since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, global regulators — from the US to Singapore to the global Basel Committee — have also turned their attention towards financial institutions’ increasing dependence on technology, and the consequences of an outage or cyber attack on the ecosystem.
