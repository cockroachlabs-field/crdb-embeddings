This Madrid neighborhood is colloquially named after its main street, Calle Huertas, and it’s also known as the place to go out. It’s five minutes walking from Sol, and the perfect place to start your night. Huertas street is lined with all types of bars, some upscale and some divey, plus lots of great restaurants too. There are many other little streets to discover such as Calle Leon (on the left in the photo below) also lined with fun bars and old-school delicatessens, boutiques and more. One of Huertas’ highlights is Restaurante Meceira (amazing Galician food) and Bar Populart (often called Madrid’s best jazz bar), though the list goes on. If you walk down Huertas street, you’ll end up on the Castellana, Madrid’s largest boulevard which at that point is actually called Paseo del Prado, full of museums and sightseeing activities, thus turning Huertas into a good day-neighborhood as well.
