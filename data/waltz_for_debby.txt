Achingly beautiful and heralded for its almost impressionist textures, this second live recording at the Village Vanguard in 1961 retains its legendary status for pianists and jazz fans alike. Evan’s stellar trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian displays moments of delicate introspection, such as on the opener “My Foolish Heart,” alongside a hard-swinging, muscular version of “Milestones,” and two versions of “My Romance” that showcase the trio’s exquisite interplay.
